The building of heat_repo_plugins was disabled while upstream heat
sorted out issues w/ the contrib packages and pbr >= 0.11.0.  The
upstream fix has since gone in (see
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/179671/) so we can now continue to
build heat_repo_plugins as we were prior to pbr 0.11.0 dropping.

NOTE: heat SHA has been bumped to include the commit in review 179671.

The check used by all cluster strategies is wrong. It allows for both
RUNNING and BUILD_PENDING. All cluster strategies use BUILD_PENDING to
indicate that the instances are cluster-prepare ready. RUNNING is bad as
it can be reported before the instance's prepare even starts, causing

Move the collection point for dashboards to the
horizon.dashboard module, instead stirring this concern into
the application's root level the module (horizon.app)..

This helps make it more clear that dashboards are a particular
built-in feature of the openstack_dashboard application, but
not something central to all applications that happen to use the horizon
platform.

Developers attempting to create new applications on the horizon
platform will be able to see more easily that they clone app.module.js,
but may or may not include a pluggable dashboard mechanism in their
application.

They determine which user can access which objects in which way, and are defined in the service's policy.json file.

Any changes to policy.json are effective immediately, which allows new policies to be implemented while the service is running.

Hyperv mech_driver has been moved out of neutron core code, and it
became a stand alone package. Current network cookbook did not
install the hyperv mech_driver, so add the logic in hyperv recipe
to intall the hyperv mech_driver when the hyperv is configured in

These are for managing gate jobs, installing some base requirements, and updating repository information. The scripts are intended to be invoked from the top-level directory of os-ansible-deployment. Invocation would look like: .. code:: bash $ scripts/<script_name>.sh Bootstrapping Scripts --------------------- bootstrap-aio.sh ++++++++++++++++ This script is intended to prepare and 'all-in-one' server for the purposes of gating and development. It will create necessary partitions, directories, and configurations. The script is configurable with environment variables in order to work well with Jenkins. bootstrap-ansible.sh ++++++++++++++++++++ This script is required to install Ansible, as well as it's core and extras modules repositories. The version of Ansible installed is from git using the ``ANSIBLE_GIT_RELEASE`` environment variable. In adtion, the script will install any Ansible Galaxy roles specified in the ``ANSIBLE_ROLE_FILE`` variable (defaulted to ``ansible-role-requirements.yml``). Finally, this script creates the ``openstack-ansible`` wrapper tool. This tool provides the variable files matching ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_*.yml`` as arguments to ``ansible-playbook`` as a convenience. Gating Scripts -------------- gate-check-commit.sh ++++++++++++++++++++ Each commit passing through the gate must pass the tests in ``gate-check-commit.sh``. By default, script will bootstrap an AIO, install Ansible, and then run Tempest tests. These options can be controlled with the ``BOOTSTRAP_AIO``, ``BOOTSTRAP_ANSIBLE``, and ``RUN_TEMPEST`` environment variables, respectivately. gate-check-docs.sh ++++++++++++++++++ Documentation is built with the ``gate-check-docs.sh`` script. This ensure the Sphinx documentation files will build into HTML files without errors. gate-check-lint.sh ++++++++++++++++++ The ``gate-check-lint.sh`` script runs against all commits to verify correct YAML and Python syntax. All files that begin with Python shebang line are passed through flake8. The following rules are ignored due to Ansible conventions: * F403 - 'from ansible.module_utils.basic import \*' * H303 - No wildcard imports Ansible playbooks are passed through ``ansible-playbook --syntax-check`` and ``ansible-lint``. run-tempest.sh ++++++++++++++ This script will run Tempest tests from the first utility container. It is called by ``gate-check-commit.sh``. The Tempest tests that aer run are defined by the ``TEMPEST_SCRIPT_PARAMETERS`` variable. These are passed to the ``openstack_tempest_gate.sh`` script, defined in the ``os_tempest`` role. ",,88,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =============================== Eliminate Floating IP Namespace =============================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/eliminate-dvr-fip-ns The distributed virtual router functionality introduced a new namespace on compute hypervisor hosts called the floating IP (fip) namespace. These can be seen on hypersisor hosts by looking for fip- in the name. This proposal is to obsolete and eliminate that namespace in some, if not all, deployments. Problem Description =================== The fip namespace adds complexity to the data path on a hypervisor host for north/south routing. Instead of a router gateway connecting directly to an external gateway bridge, it must be connected using an extra veth pair to a fip namespace shared by all routers on the same hypervisor host connecting to the same external network. Synchronization around fip namespace operations has been problematic. This is because the L3 agent was designed to handle many routers in multiple threads. The agent properly synchronizes operations on any given router. However, since many routers touch the same shared fip namespace, this synchronization isn't enough. It leads to many concurrent operations on the fip namespace which are not properly coordinated. Possible solutions to this problem are to redesign this area of the L3 agent or to eliminate the fip namespace. Given the inherent added complexity, eliminating it is worth some serious discussion. Proposed Change =============== The proposed solution is to allow turning off the fip namespace when it is not needed and connecting qrouters directly to external net bridges. Any existing gateway ports allocated for the fip namespace would be deallocated as they're torn down. To be sure this can be done, we need to first understand why the fip namespace was created in the first place and then find another way to address it those reasons. Those are discussed in the next section after detailed the proposal here. The L3 agent will support a migration scenario where DVR is already deployed with a fip namespace on hypervisor hosts. This could be done with minimal disruption in service. When the L3 agent code is upgraded, the agent will be restarted on each hypervisor. At that time, a full sync of all of the routers on the agent will be triggered. For each router, the agent needs to request a port be allocated on the external network's backing network. This will allocate a private IP address and a mac address for the router. It doesn't need a port on the public front network. The L3 agent will wire up this new port directly to the external network bridge much like in non-dvr mode and add a route to the external network through the gateway on the backing network. At this point it will remove the route to the external network through the fip namespace and remove the veth pair connecting them. Finally, when all of the routers have been disconnected from the fip namespace, the gateway port that had been allocated on the public network can be de-allocated and the fip namespace can be cleaned up and removed. The L3 agent will also provide the reverse migration to go the other way. This will be accomplished by breaking the current DvrRouter class in the L3 agent in to two. One that includes the fip namespace complexity and one that does not. Common code will be factored out in to a common base class. Eventually, I'd like to phase out the fip namespace entirely by eliminated any and all need for it. However, that may take some time. This proposal is to give the option to do without it. Discussion ---------- The fip namespace serves two purposes: #. Avoid needing a public IP address for each router/host combination. #. Avoid needing a mac address for each router/host combination and, most of all, to keep all of those mac addresses off of the wire. In effect, the fip namespace addresses both of these concerns by presenting a united front to the external network on behalf of all of the floating ips that terminate on the a given hypervisor and then routing on the hypervisor host. IP Address Consumption ______________________ The routing-networks blueprint [#]_ offers a mechanism to eliminate public IP address consumption while still assigning a dedicated (private) IP address to each router/hypervisor pair. In fact, part of its scope is to eliminate the one public address that is still consumed per hypervisor. .. [#] https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/routing-networks This has the disadvantage that routers on the external network but outside of Neutron need to be configured with an extra link-local subnet. Unfortunately, this means that in an upgrade scenario, the deployer will have take some action out-of-band before this can work. This implies that we need to support the old mechanism and an upgrade path to the new mechanism. MAC Address Explosion _____________________ With DVR and no fip namespace (i.e each qrouter is connected directly to the external network bridge) the number of mac addresses for qrouter gateway ports will be on the same order as the number of VM ports. There may be cases where multiple VMs on the same hypervisor host will share a qrouter gateway port but as the environment scales up, it will approach one-to-one gateway ports to vm ports. The concern is that if we have one mac address per VM port on the wire, then the infrastructure switches' tables will fill and they will not be able to efficiently switch traffic. As an example, I worked with a deployment with a mac table cache size of 32k on a network designed to host 100k vms. Larger caches may be available but typically mean more expensive hardware. This drives the cost of larger deployments up. This concern is more relevant to some environments than to others. Many -- if not most -- deployments will be small enough that it just doesn't matter. Larger deployments may choose to plan for the capacity and still want to do without the fip namespace. Also, there are other approaches to scaling that would allow deployments to scale much larger without expensive hardware by limiting the scope of the contiguous L2 fabric. Those are out of the scope of this blueprint. Data Model Impact ----------------- None REST API Impact --------------- None Security Impact --------------- None Notifications Impact -------------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ By simplifying the data path, I expect some improvement in latency and possibly throughput on a hypervisor host. IPv6 Impact ----------- None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- Deployers will not see any impact when upgrading code as the default will be the same, at least during this development cycle. The deployer will make the choice to benefit from this enhancement. At that time, the deployer will need to create a backing network for each external network. This is detailed in the routing-networks blueprint. It includes configuring the northbound switch with a new private subnet. The backing network must have a subnet large enough for every VM port on the network. The deployer must set this up before hand. These IPs should not cause issues with arp tables on the routers because they won't be arped in normal operation. The IPs will be there for probing and debugging by the operator. When the backing network is in place, the L3 agents can be configured to operate in the no_fip_namespace mode and restarted. This will not cause downtime or a network disruption. It is okay to run some agents in each mode throughout the datacenter. This will ease the burden of migration. Developer Impact ---------------- There will be two versions of DVR routers in the code tree until the more complex one can be phased out. Community Impact ---------------- It reduces complexity. The fip namespace has been discussed in a number of conversations and is widely perceived as complex. Alternatives ------------ The alternative is to keep the fip namespace and make it more robust. The problem has been that the L3 agent was designed to synchronize operations on a given router but to parallelize between routers. The fip namespace is shared between routers but there is not synchronization there. This, for example, may cause one thread of code to be deleting the fip namespace when another thread codes in and decides that it should be used for a new router. These race conditions must be fixed up. Given that this proposal keeps the option to use it, they should be cleaned up anyway. Keeping it keeps the added complexity. It is more to learn because operators need to realize that the IP address is in the qrouter namespace but fip is doing proxy arp for it and some routing.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================= Eliminate the Dedicated Router IP ================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/no-router-ip In Neutron, routers get a dedicated public IP assigned when they plug in to an external network. This IP is used for a number of services. It can even be set explicitly now [#]_. The issue is that if there are no services which need this public IP, it is still allocated and is wasted. This proposal is to clean this up so that a public IP gets allocated only when it will be used by a service. .. [#] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/83664/ .. TODO Need to assess impact of the API to set the IP on this proposal. Add APIImpact flag if needed. Problem Description =================== The problem is that an IP address is wasted when it is allocated to a router that doesn't need it. Proposed Change =============== Overview -------- This proposal is to allocate a public IP to a router only when the IP will be used by some service. The following are examples of such a service. - Default SNAT access to external network for instances without floating IPs. - VPNaaS - DNS forwarding from dnsmasq For the default SNAT feature, there are a few alternatives some which can be accomplished now and some which will require a bit more work outside the scope of this blueprint. Examples include SNAT only floating IPs, implementing NAT outside of Neutron, or turning default NAT off completely. All options have their trade-offs. This BP isn't really about finding an alternative, it is about saving the IP address when the current feature is turned off. Each router will always be assigned an IP address, just not a public IP address. This blueprint depends on the routing-networks blueprint which enables using a private subnet in addition to the public subnets. Data Model Impact ----------------- None, given that the data model changes for the routing-networks blueprint are in place. .. TODO Is this really true? I don't think we need any data model changes. But, what if the API user requests a specific API (external_ip attribute added by Kevin) for the router but does not enable any services. Should it still get the IP? How will it be recorded in the database that a specific IP was requested. I guess it only matters when the user adds services and then removes them. https://review.openstack.org/#/c/83664/ - adds external_ip option REST API Impact --------------- None Security Impact --------------- Shouldn't have any negative security impact. Not having a public IP address may reduce the attack surface a bit. This could be viewed as a positive security impact. Notifications Impact -------------------- This should not require any changes to existing notifications. RPC calls for router information will change because the router's gateway interface may no longer carry a fixed IP. Most of this will be addressed in the routing-networks blueprint specification. Other End User Impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None IPv6 Impact ----------- This change isn't as important for IPv6. There is no concern around wasting IP addresses, especially within an IPv6 subnet. So, giving out addresses to routers is not a big deal. This change will not break any existing functionality in IPv6. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- None Developer Impact ---------------- None Community Impact ---------------- This has come up a number of times informally but has not been discussed in a session at summit. The general waste of IPv4 address space is a common theme which supports this proposal. Alternatives ------------ Leave the requirement for a dedicated router public IP.

The move to keystone v3 in Devstack means that the endpoint-list

This patch rolls up all the changes to the requirements repo that were
not altering global requirements, so that we can use the library from
infra jobs targeting kilo. We had to also change the
generate-requirements cross-check to not try to compile
upper-constraints for 3.4 - g-r in kilo is not compatible with 3.4.

provide more meaningful output on update.py

In an attempt to make the proposal bot changes for requirements be
more meaningful make the update.py script return something that's more
user friendly.

Now by default the script will return the following to stdout on success:

Version change for: mox, mox3, testrepository, testtools
Updated project/test-requirements.txt:
    mox==0.5.3                     ->   mox>=0.5.3
    mox3==0.7.3                    ->   mox3>=0.7.0
    testrepository>=0.0.13         ->   testrepository>=0.0.17
    testtools>=0.9.27              ->   testtools>=0.9.32

Add a verbose flag that will provide much of the previous debug info.

Eliminate the giant dict dump of all the requirements files, as that
was largely impossible to make sense of, and rarely provided any
insight. During a devstack run you'll have git hashes for all the
trees, so can track down exact file contents if needed.

By making this the default stdout we can then capture and use this for
the git commit messages.

In order to make the test output matching human readable ignore the 80
column limit for the expected blocks via #noqa.

Consolidating redundant code in the tests

This moves things that are pretty much copy-paste into one place,
letting us focus on the actual differences amongst the tests.

I've also made the local test fixtures explicit, so we can see what
each test really needs, which has also eliminated redundant test
overhead, the slowest test is now 0.05s vs 0.1 before. This is more
than paid for by the reduced duplication in the basic setup, making
the patch a net reduction in LOC.

It also fixes the tempdir leak that was present in two of the test
scripts.

Report bad package when found

When a non-standard package is found in the requirements list, we had an
error saying that but not saying what the bad package name was.

Includes-Change-Id: I860c548dce0c8f988f8fd29cead582bf9b9b6850

Add convenience tox environments

Add a venv tox environment like we use in other projects to build a
virtualenv and run commands.

Add an 'update' environment to run the command for updating the
requirements in another project.

Add a 'generate' environment to run the command for generating
constraints.

Includes-Change-Id: Ib99fb4da6f62afd31339fa698c8f0e50ce817128

Teach the constraints generator about excludes.

Some things like flake8 can't be constrained, so we need an opt-out
clause.

Includes-Change-Id: I11eb0d762869ad8920795fb710f1b2eeb9354f12

Add upper-constraints.txt.

This is a first approximation to the transitive union of requirements,
built by generate-constraints with python 2.7 and 3.4. It will be
updated by a periodic job (which we'll add shortly) proposing future
merges to this repository. Its not yet cross-checked for compatibility
with proposed global-requirements.txt changes, that will come later.

Having the file present now allows us to start working on the
consuming side in parallel and has no downsides, since no projects
jobs will be voting based on this until all the pieces are in place
and battle tested.

Show not-in-global errors again.

This regressed when I half-split it into actions and IO (exception
raising). Moving it entirely into actions lets us see all the errors
very easily.

Includes-Change-Id: I12e6d910bf983841b4ad81aa41a95bf341456fe4

Manual update run to get things aligned.

Includes-Change-Id: I04f02aa3c9bd9e37922dff37c2982709d4136938

Test that changes to requirements are freezable.

If we can't generate a new constraints file, don't let changes in.

Includes-Change-Id: If5aa15bb9ca75db0b8ef89a13c9b4bbf8d45cae2

Prevent incompatible version bumps.

We shouldn't be able to bump global requirement versions if that
would be incompatible with the current test set of versions. To assess
'works' we need to run them in tests which means that we need to
update upper-constraints.txt at the same time. We don't test all
versions however, so just checking that the constraints version is
compatible with the updated global requirements is sufficient.

This adds a dependency on the pypa packaging library. The library is
maintained by the authors of setuptools and pip, is Apache V2, in good
condition and Python 3 ready. Its a test-only dependency so I don't
think the distro packaging status matters. This is *the* reference
library for packaging facilities on Python.

Includes-Change-Id: I032dd9a384453dcfa4911ea905c8f89b0c974211

Split project and requirement types out.

These don't need to be hidden within update.py anymore, and we need
them for lint and edit.

Includes-Change-Id: I92f4ff51f98f6343cc94a74a69660306b742dbf3

Move commands into cmds subdir.

This is a useful hint to readers about whether a module is library or UI.

Includes-Change-Id: I177449fc6820e82fed938f2c216b6b9f9192957f

Add edit-constraints command.

This allows shell editing of a constraints file, which we need to do
in devstack when installing a constrained library from git.

The serializer needs to report the version of the toplevel object
that we were trying to deserialize when we encountered the incompatible
version. We depend on the implementor of the indirection_api to use
the object relationship mappings to return to us a fully-supported
object tree based on the version at the top.

This patch fixes the serializer to report the toplevel version instead
of the one that caused the fault.

This patch aims to solve an issue when, in some cases, the L3 agent might
start before the OVS agent during a node boot process.
At such scenario, the L3 agent will configure the routers before the OVS agent
done syncing with the server and starts processing ovsdb monitor updates.

The result:
1. L3 agent finishes configuring an HA router
2. Keepalived spawned
3. In case of transition to master state, it (keepalived) sends gratuitous ARPs
                                                            ^---The issue
4. The OVS agent has just finished plugging its ports

Meaning, the gratuitous ARP will be lost, but the router acting as master.

Prepare nodes settings and use provisioning feature of Fuel to install operating system and configure disks on nodes. #. Make modifications to deployment information of the environment that affects all CIC nodes and deploy OpenStack platform onto them. This section describes what need to do if you don't have additional hardware Isolated deployment +++++++++++++++++++ The most important modification to the default deployment process used in Fuel installer is deployment with predefined IP addresses in isolated mode. This section describes what isolated deployment mode is and how we configure it on the nodes. 6.0 needs to use same VIP addresses as 5.1.1, for this we need to remove physical connections between 6.0 CIC and Management and Public networks. Modify deployment settings ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ In order to deploy 6.0 CIC nodes properly, we need to prepare deployment information to make Fuel configure nodes and OpenStack services with the following modifications: #. Disable checking access to default gateway in Public network before running deployment operation on 6.0 CIC. #. Avoid creating patch ports to connect logical bridges to physical interfaces of 6.0 CIC during subsequent deployment operation on those CIC. #. Replace VIP addresses in 6.0 deployment info Deployment settings can be downloaded from Fuel API as a set of files. We update settings by changing those files and uploading modified information back via Fuel API. Provision CIC node +++++++++++++++++++ This section contains detailed descriptions and command listings to revome node from original environment, prepare and provision it in 6.0 Seed environment. Remove controller from 5.1 environment ______________________________________ We download network and disk settings of node because we need it later for configuring this node in new cluster. After that we removed node from target cluster. :: export CIC_ID=<controller from orig env> fuel node --node $CIC_ID --network --download --dir /tmp fuel node --node $CIC_ID --disk --download --dir /tmp fuel node --node $CIC_ID delete fuel --env $ORIG_ID deploy-changes Add 6.0 CIC node _________________ Need to wait for removed node will be discovered by fuel again with other ID. :: export NEW_CIC_ID=$(fuel node \ | awk -F\| '$2~/discover/{print($1)}' \ | tr -d ' ' | sort -n -r | head -1) Run the following command to add controller node to 6.0 Seed environment: :: fuel --env $SEED_ID node set --node $NEW_CIC_ID --role controller Configure interfaces and disks on CIC ______________________________________ For configuring the node we use settings which we preserved earlier. Run ``octane/bin/copy-node-settings`` script to update configuration of interfaces for CIC in 6.0 Seed environment in accordance with interfaces settings of this node in 5.1.1 environment. Subcommand ``interfaces`` tells script to update networking information, ``disk`` updates disks settings. Second positional argument is a name of file with interfaces settings for 6.0 env's CIC. Third argument is a name of file with interfaces settings for node in 5.1.1 environment: :: fuel node --node $NEW_CIC_ID --network --download --dir /tmp fuel node --node $NEW_CIC_ID --disk --download --dir /tmp ./copy-node-settings interfaces /tmp/node_${NEW_CIC_ID}/interfaces.yaml \ /tmp/node_$NODE_ID/interfaces.yaml > /tmp/interfaces.yaml mv /tmp/interfaces.yaml /tmp/node_${NEW_CIC_ID}/interfaces.yaml ./copy-node-settings disks /tmp/node_${NEW_CIC_ID}/disks.yaml \ /tmp/node_$NODE_ID/disks.yaml by_extra > /tmp/disks.yaml mv /tmp/disks.yaml /tmp/node_${NEW_CIC_ID}/disks.yaml Upload settings for CIC in 6.0 Seed environment to Fuel API: :: fuel node --node $NEW_CIC_ID --network --upload --dir /tmp fuel node --node $NEW_CIC_ID --disk --upload --dir /tmp Provision CIC node ___________________ Start provisioning of CIC node in 6.0 Seed environment using Fuel CLI command: :: fuel node --env $SEED_ID --node $NEW_CIC_ID --provision You can check status of node in the 6.0 Seed environment using the following command: :: fuel node --env $SEED_ID Network isolation +++++++++++++++++ 6.0 environment has similar vip addresses as the 5.1.1 environment, and for avoiding IP conflicts need to configure interfaces on 6.0 CIC so they are not connected to physical networks. Paragraphs below describe how to create and configure OpenVSwitch on 6.0 CIC to ensure that CIC is isolated from 5.1.1 environment. Make sure 6.0 CIC provisioning is finished before proceeding: :: fuel node --env $SEED_ID | grep provisioned Install OpenVSwitch ___________________ Run the following command to connect to CIC node in the 6.0 Seed environment and install 'openvswitch-switch' package: :: ssh root@node-${NEW_CIC_ID} apt-get -y install openvswitch-switch Create OVS bridges __________________ Prepare bridges for Management and Public networks on 6.0 CIC, ``br-mgmt`` and ``br-ex`` correspondingly. Run the following command to CIC node in the environment and run ``ovs-vsctl`` command on node for each ``BRIDGE`` name of ``br-mgmt``, ``br-ex``: :: for BRIDGE in br-mgmt br-ex; do ssh root@node-${NEW_CIC_ID} ovs-vsctl add-br $BRIDGE ssh root@node-${NEW_CIC_ID} ip link set dev $BRIDGE mtu 1450 done Prepare deployment settings +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Download deployment settings ____________________________ Use Fuel CLI to download deployment parameters for 6.0 Seed environment: :: fuel --env $SEED_ID deployment --default --dir /tmp/ Disable deployment of patch ports _________________________________ During deployment, Fuel manifests will create OpenVSwitch bridges and connect them to each other and to physical ports. This process is managed by ``'transformation'`` section of node deployment settings. Disable creation of patch ports between bridge pairs that include ``'br-ex'`` or ``'br-mgmt'``. To do that, first create copy of deployment information directory: :: cp -R /tmp/deployment_${SEED_ID} /tmp/deployment_${SEED_ID}.orig There are actions in a ``'transformations'`` section of deployment information for which type is ``'add-patch'``. Every action of this type has 2 bridges specified. You need to delete all actions of this type that have ``'br-ex'`` or ``'br-mgmt'`` among its bridges. You have to do this for every yaml file in ``/tmp/deployment_<SEED_ID>`` directory. You can use helper script ``octane/helpers/transformations.py``. Run the following command to remove configuration of patch ports to both Public and Management networks: :: pushd /root/octane/helpers/; python ./transformations.py /tmp/deployment_${SEED_ID} remove_patch_ports; popd; Run the following command to set a value of parameter ``'run_ping_checker'`` to ""*false*"" in the deployment settings for node. This will allow deployment to work while default gateway is unavailable in Public network due to network isolation: ls /tmp/deployment_$SEED_ID/** \ | xargs -I{} sh -c ""echo 'run_ping_checker: \""false\""' >> {}"" Create 5.1.1 CIC hosts file ___________________________ Create file ``/tmp/env-5.1-cic.hosts`` with a list of IP addresses of all CIC nodes in 5.1.1 environment: :: fuel node --env $ORIG_ID | awk -F\| '$7 ~ /controller/ {print $5}' \ | tr -d ' ' > /tmp/env-5.1-cic.hosts Update Virtual IP in Management network _______________________________________ For proper replacement of 5.1.1 CICs, change Management VIP address in deployment settings for 6.0 environment to addresses of 5.1.1. Identify Virtual IP address for Management network in 5.1.1 environment. Use ``pssh`` command to query all CIC nodes in 5.1.1 environment for Virtual IP address: :: export VIP=$(pssh -i -h /tmp/env-5.1-cic.hosts \ ""ip netns exec haproxy ip addr show dev hapr-m"" \ | fgrep -e ""inet "" \ | sed -re ""s%.*inet ([0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3})/.*%\1%"") Now update parameter ``'management_vip'`` in deployment settings files with the value of VIP variable: :: sed -re 's%management_vip:.*$%management_vip: '$VIP'%' \ -i /tmp/deployment_$SEED_ID/*.yaml Update Virtual IP in Public network ___________________________________ For proper replacement of 5.1.1 CICs, change Public VIP addresses in deployment settings for 6.0 environment to addresses of 5.1.1. :: VIP=$(pssh -i -h /tmp/env-5.1-cic.hosts \ ""ip netns exec haproxy ip addr show dev hapr-p"" \ | fgrep -e ""inet "" \ | sed -re ""s%.*inet ([0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3})/.*%\1%"") Now update parameter ``'public_vip'`` in deployment settings files with the value of VIP variable: :: sed -re 's%public_vip:.*$%public_vip: '$VIP'%' \ -i /tmp/deployment_${SEED_ID}/*.yaml Remove predefined networks __________________________ Use helper script ``octane/helper/transformations.py`` to remove list of networks that Fuel should create upon deployment in OpenStack Networking from deployment settings: :: pushd /root/octane/helpers/ python ./transformations.py /tmp/deployment_${SEED_ID} remove_predefined_nets popd Upload deployment settings __________________________ Use Fuel CLI command to update deployment settings for 6.0 Seed environment: :: fuel --env $SEED_ID deployment --upload --dir /tmp Deploy Seed environment _______________________ Use Fuel CLI command to start deployment of the 6.0 Seed environment: :: fuel --env $SEED_ID node --node $NEW_CIC_ID --deploy ",,984,0

During the Ops Feedback session at the Vancouver summit one feature
request was the ability for swift to attempt to find handoff nodes
close (same region) as the failed primary node.

The proxy already has write affinity which does this. But the
replicators do not. Swift already, when searching for handoff nodes,
tries to keep objects dispersed, so this option is turned off by
default and should only activated if you really want swift to try
and find a handoff node in the same region as the failed node.

This change adds a new parameter to
{object,container,account}-replicator sections of the server
configurations. This parameter is 'handoff_affinity' and defaults
to 0. This number, like in write_affinity, is the number of handoff
nodes to try in the same region as the failed primary node before
falling back to finding a handoff node elsewhere in the cluster.

Because the handoff nodes may (if activated) be determined by the
primary node failing the replication algorithm in the db_replicator
and object replicator has changed slightly. Instead of trying the
primary nodes first and on a 507 continuing down the handoff
nodes, it now loops through each primary nodes, if we fail to
replicate due to a 507 start looking for a handoff node to place
it on before going to the next primary node.

This is a attempt 1, and am sure there will be many other iterations
coming, let the reviews commence!

corresponding volume.

This commit catches these exceptions so that the backup service is
not prevented from starting in this circumstance.

Nova will not disconnect with volume when users detach volume from
paused instance.

Because of nova will search all block devices which are defined in xml
for all guest. Then disconnect ISCSI block which was existed in
/dev/disk/by-path and didn't been define in any guest.
But paused instance's xml define will still contain dev which prefer
to remove. Therefore nova will not disconnect with this volume.

We should skip detached disk, which is in paused guest and its source dev
didn't occur in other disk node, when calling get all block device function.

This change adds the container network MTU option within the container
network LXC config file. This will allow a deployer to set the MTU within
a provider networks entry in openstack_user_config.yml.

Example:

  ....
  provider_networks:
    - network:
        container_bridge: ""br-storage""
        container_type: ""veth""
        container_interface: ""eth2""
        ip_from_q: ""storage""
        type: ""raw""
        container_mtu: ""9000""
        group_binds:
          - glance_api
          - cinder_api
          - cinder_volume
          - nova_compute
          - swift_proxy

This changes gives the deployer the ability to selectively set the mtu as
needed.

The dynamic_inventory.py script has been updated to allow for the MTU entry.

Example file documentation has been added to show how to use this new setting.

These are Cinder Client specific changes for modifying volume
and snapshot's image metadata.

- cinder image-metadata volume_id set key=value
This command can be used to create a new image metadata associated
with the volume when the key not exists, and update the value for
the existed key.

- cinder image-metadata volume_id unset key
This command can be used to delete image metadata associated

Problem Description ===================== There are several usecases to forward packets without considering about packet header. For example, in Service Function Chaining(SFC) usecase, when transparent network function (e.g. IDS, WAN Accelator) is dynamically inserted into the chain, destination of packets are changed regardless of the IP or MAC addresses. These functions can be described as forwarding rules, but in Neutron API it is not defined. So in this spec, we propose forwarding rules and classifiers as new extention of Neutron API. Proposed Change ================ Add the forwarding rules and classifiers to Neutron API as extension.

When the forwarding rule is set, the Neutron port specified as src and dests can not communicate to normal virtual network.(packet is not sent to virtual network and it can not be received.) The packet sent from the Neutron port is transmitted to the specified Neutron port. When set multiple destinations to the dests of forwarding rule, packet from the source port is transferred to all destination ports. If the destination is not specified in dests, the packet is dropped. When the classifier is specified, only packet that matches the classifier is transferred. If multiple classifiers is specified, all of the packets that match these classifier is transferred. If the classifier is not specified, all packets are transferred to the destination. Forwarding rule is unique by src port and classifier. Evaluation order is longest match.(For example, the classifier that TCP and dest_port = 80 is specified, the priority is higher than the specified only TCP.) Protocol of the classifier can be specified is ""icmp"", ""tcp"", ""udp""(Case-sensitivity is not considered.) and protocol number. (It follows the definition of IANA. http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml ) When src_port_range of classifier is specified, it evaluates the src port of the packet. The value of the min and max are included. (Example, when min and max is 0 and port of packet is 0, it is regarded as matching.) When dst_port_range of classifier is specified, it evaluates the dst port of the packet. When src_ip_prefix of classifier is specified, source ip address of the packet is to be a match and if within the range of CIDR specified in src_ip_prefix. When dst_ip_prefix of classifier is specified, if source ip address of packet is within range of CIDR which is specified in src_ip_prefix, it will be regard as matching. Classifier should be specified as one or more from each of the protocol, src_port_range, dst_port_range, src_ip_prefix or dst_ip_prefix. (When specifying the port range, you must specified both min and max.) When you specify a port range, you must specify the protocol.

In Nova flavors it is ok to specify a decimal RXTX factor.
For this reason when applying QoS to a port Neutron should not
convert this factor to an integer value, but simply ensure
it's a valid float number and positive.

This patch ialso drops the conversion to integer that happens
in the NSX-mh plugin but also ensures that the resulting maximum
bandwidth after applying the RXTX factor is still an integer value.

1. Update an aws asg with invalid 'VPCZoneIdentifier',
the stack update failed.
2. Update again, the stack is always in 'UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS'.

We remove the backup resources first when updating,
but the backup of stack_resource can't be deleted,
due we set an incorrect name of stack_identity before
rpc calling 'delete_stack', due the name is not match the
nested_stack's name.

Encoding the buggy behavior of not doing what's expected in the old API doesn't seem valid for long term maintenance. * Does the API now return a different status code for the same operations? * YES - this is a change in the contract, it should have a microversion. * Does the API now return a different payload (an add or remove of any fields in the json structure)? * YES - this is a change in the contract, it should have a microversion. * Does this change add or remove a REST resource? * YES - this is a change in the contract, it should have a microversion. * Does the change add or remove a parameter passed on the request? * YES - this is a change in the contract, it should have a microversion. * Does the change add a field by which things can be filtered or sorted on? Example: adding an ability to filter servers by ipv6 address. * YES - this is a change in the contract, it should have a microversion.

This is maintained by hand, with changing going through CI. We also maintain a compiled list of the exact versions, including transitive dependencies, of packages that are known to work in the OpenStack CI system. This is maintained via an automated process that calculates the list and proposes a change back to this repository. A consequence of this is that new releases of OpenStack libraries are not immediately used: they have to pass through this automated process before we can benefit from (or be harmed by) them.``upper-constraints.txt`` is machine generated and nothing more or less than an exact list of versions. Devstack ++++++++ When ``USE_CONSTRAINTS`` is set ``True``, devstack uses the pip ``-c`` option to pin all the libraries to known good versions. ``edit-constraints`` can be used to unpin a single constraint, and this is done to install libraries from git. This is the **recommended** way to use devstack. When ``USE_CONSTRAINTS`` is set ``False``, devstack overwrite the ``requirements.txt`` and ``test-requirements.txt`` for **all** installed projects with the versions from ``global-requirements.txt``. Projects that are not in ``projects.txt`` get 'soft' updates, ones that are get 'hard' updated. This attempts to ensure that we will get a deterministic set of requirements installed in the test system, and it won't be a guessing game based on the last piece of software to be installed. However due to the interactions with transitive dependencies this doesn't actually deliver what we need, and is **not recommended**. Tox +++ We are working on the necessary changes to use ``upper-constraints.txt`` in tox jobs but it is not yet complete.``global-requirements.txt``. This job should be proposed to infra at the same time as proposing the change in ``openstack/requirements``.Tools ===== All the tools require openstack_requirements to be installed (e.g. in a Python virtualenv). They all have help, which is the authoritative documentation. update-requirements ------------------- This will update the requirements in a project from the global requirements file found in ``.``. Alternatively, pass ``--source`` to use a different global requirements file:: update-requirements --source /opt/stack/requirements /opt/stack/nova Entries in all requirements files will have their versions updated to match the entries listed in the global requirements. Excess entries will cause errors in hard mode (the default) or be ignored in soft mode. generate-constraints -------------------- Compile a constraints file showing the versions of resulting from installing all of ``global-requirements.txt``:: generate-constraints -p /usr/bin/python2.7 -p /usr/bin/python3.4 \ -b blacklist.txt > new-constraints.txt edit-constraints ---------------- Replace all references to a package in a constraints file with a new specification. Used by devstack to enable git installations of libraries that are normally constrained:: edit-constraints oslo.db ""-e file://opt/stack/oslo.db#egg=oslo.db"" Proposing changes ================= Look at the `Review Guidelines` and make sure your change meets them. All changes to ``global-requirements.txt`` may dramatically alter the contents of ``upper-constraints.txt`` due to adding or removing transitive dependencies. As such you should always generate a diff against the current merged constraints, otherwise your change may fail if it is incompatible wit the current tested constraints. Regenerating involves five steps. 1) Install the dependencies needed to compile various Python packages:: sudo apt-get install $(bindep -b) 2) Create a reference file (do this without your patch applied):: generate-constraints -p /usr/bin/python2.7 -p /usr/bin/python3.4 \ -b blacklist.txt > baseline 3) Apply your patch and generate a new reference file:: generate-constraints -p /usr/bin/python2.7 -p /usr/bin/python3.4 \ -b blacklist.txt > updated 4) Diff them:: diff -p baseline updated 5) Apply the patch to ``upper-constraints.txt``. This may require some fiddling. ``edit-constraint`` can do this for you **when the change does not involve multiple lines for one package**.proposed requirements change. Proposers can make reviews easier by including the answers to these questions in the commit message for their change. For ``upper-constraints.txt`` changes ------------------------------------- If the change was proposed by the OpenStack CI bot, then if the change has passed CI, only one reviewer is needed and they should +2 +A without thinking about things. If the change was not proposed by the OpenStack CI bot, and does not include a ``global-requirements.txt`` change, then it should be rejected: the CI bot will generate an appropriate change itself. Ask in #openstack-infra if the bot needs to be run more quickly. Otherwise the change may be the result of recalculating the constraints which changed when a ``global-requirements.txt`` change is proposed. In this case, ignore the changes to ``upper-constraints.txt`` and review the ``global-requirements.txt`` component of the change.","``setup.cfg``.Currently when installing with devstack, we overwrite the ``requirements.txt`` and ``test-requirements.txt`` for **all** installed projects with the versions from ``global-requirements.txt``. This attempts to ensure that we will get a deterministic set of requirements installed in the test system, and it won't be a guessing game based on the last piece of software to be installed. However due to the interactions with transitive dependencies this doesn't actually deliver what we need. We are moving to a system where we will define the precise versions of all dependencies using ``upper-constraints.txt``. This will be overlaid onto all pip commands made during devstack, and by tox, and will provide a single, atomic, source of truth for what works at any given time. The constraints will be required to be compatible with the global requirements, and will [eventually] be total.``global-requirements.txt``.Running ======= To run the requirements update manually, run:: python update.py path/to/project Entries in requirements.txt and test-requirements.txt will have their versions updated to match the entries listed here. Any entries in the target project which do not first exist here will be removed. No entries will be added.proposed requirements change (and ones that proposers should pre answer to make things go smoother).",123,25

ssync rx sends a header X-Backend-Replication-Headers whose value is a
list of headers that the source object has. This list extends the list
of allowed headers on the target object server, so that the target
object metadata is faithfully reconstructed to match the source.

Unfortunately the combination of lower() and title() operations on
header keys results in the source 'ETag' value being added to the target
metadata under the key 'Etag' in addition to the 'ETag' key that the
receiving server adds (note different capitilization), both having
the same value.

The spurious 'Etag' metadata is potentially confusing for humans
inspecting the object metadata and complicates tests that wish to
assert the equality of two object metadata dicts. See for example the
test in test_ssync_sender.py that this patch cleans up.

Furthermore, the possibility of having both Etag and ETag keys has
required a workaround in the EC reconstructor [1].

A breaking change to the paste.ini was introduced in git commit
3b20d84312b6870557a5b1db346de75e928ddbe8 where the main app was
renamed from ""apiapp"" to ""apiapp_v1"".

This was an unnecessary change that would force deployers to rewrite
their configuration files, which may include changes to configuration
management systems.

This change reverts the incompatible name change so that operators are
able to upgrade from Kilo to Liberty witouth having to rewrite their
paste file.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode Title of your blueprint ======================= Liberty release documentation updates Problem Description =================== The documentation needs to be easy for new users and contributors while following similar OpenStack docs structure and conventions. Proposed Change =============== Organize the documentation around four sections: What Is Akanda, Installing Akanda, Operating Akanda, and Akanda Developer Guide. This change will make the Akanda documentation [1] read similar to the existing OpenStack documentation [2]. This will also prepare the Akanda documentation for merging with the OpenStack documentation. What Is Akanda section will hold the existing High Level Architecture, Service VM Orchestration and Management, The Service VM sections. We will add user documentation for demonstrating akanda, understanding how it orchestrates network services, and how to compare (or not to) akanda to other SDN options. Add some details around EW and NS frame/packet flow between compute nodes. Make IPv6 support very clear and called out. Explain the driver concept and how it will make support of new Neutron Advanced services easier. Additionally provide understanding of how Akanda integrates with Neutron. Say all this without duplicating any of the existing OpenStack documentation. Installing Akanda section will hold the existing Akanda Developer Quickstart. Adding installing from tarballs, source, and eventually distribution. Operating Akanda will hold the existing Operation and Deployment and Configuration Options. We will add the training material here. We will need to add details on dynamic routing support, how the configuration drift support works and is managed. Links to supporting ML2 drivers like linuxbridge and OVS. Making it clear how Akanda supports common Neutron configurations and configuration changes. Add details on supporting VXLAN overlay and Lightweight Network Virtualization (LNV) (Hierarchical Port Binding) with Akanda. Akanda Developer Guide will hold the details on setting up the developer environment, testing code locally, explaining the CI tests, along with some references to Neutron dependencies. Add using remotely hosted instances like DreamHost and Rackspace for development. This entire section will move to the Akanda developer reference section here [3], once the Akanda project is accepted into the OpenStack org repo. This spec also includes the use of docstrings in the code. We will start with updating the rug code with docstrings as the most critical. Data Model Impact ----------------- n/a REST API Impact --------------- n/a Security Impact --------------- n/a Notifications Impact -------------------- n/a Other End User Impact --------------------- n/a Performance Impact ------------------ n/a Other Deployer Impact --------------------- n/a Developer Impact ---------------- Updating the documentation structure will make it easier for new contributors to join the Akanda project. As Akanda joins the OpenStack org repo structure, it will make setting up the devref material very easy. Community Impact ---------------- The OpenStack community will better understand what the Akanda project is about and why it is important with clear documentation. Alternatives ------------ * Leave documentation as is * Wait until the Akanda project is moved into the OpenStack org repo before updating the documentation structure.

This patch changes the internals of some
of the libvirt volume drivers to use the
os-brick Connector objects.   Cinder already
uses os-brick for volume discovery and removal
for copy volume to image and image to volume
operations.

This patch changes the following libvirt volume drivers:
LibvirtISCSIVolumeDriver
LibvirtISERVolumeDriver
LibvirtAOEVolumeDriver
LibvirtFibreChannelVolumeDriver

This patch also removes the need to have the
nova/storage module that was used by the above listed
libvirt volume drivers.

This patch also fetches the initiator side information
from os-brick.  This replaces the internals of the
libvirt driver's get_volume_connector

Also updated the rootwrap filters to consolidate them under
a single comment, and added a new os-brick needed command.

How we can improve Openstack networking ============================================= Introduction ------------ It is obvious, that with the arrival of the next version Openstack we expect get some improvements. With arrival Juno relese to the Neutron arrive 2 (ma be even 3) improvements, that helps us make virtual networking in MOS better: A. network rescheduling patch - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/110893 B. DVR () C. HA-l3 agent (based on VRRP) - https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/l3-high-availability - http://assafmuller.com/2014/08/16/layer-3-high-availability/ D. since Havana we have some options, that allow us having multiple DHCP agent for serving one network. Terminology ----------- Network node Node (Controller or additional node), that contains running DHCP, L3 and Metadata agents. Controller node Node, that contains openstack API, schedulers and another control processes of Openstack components Patch ""A"" --------- This patch should allow us: - change current rescheduling mechanizm to the Neutron native. - having multiple parallel working L3-agents for increase scalability. - minimize out of service time while rescheduling. Now this time can't less 30-40 sec. After this patch I expect 3-5 sec. If we remove hard dependency Network node from Controller, and dedicate Network node as common role (it also will be useful for ""granular deployment"" task), we can recommend to customers following env scheme:: +------------+ / \ +-> * Public network * <-+ | \ / | | +------------+ | | | |ex. |ex. +----*-------+ +-------*----+ +------------+ | |-+ | |-+ | |-+ | Controller | | | dedicated | | | Compute | | | nodes | | | Network | | | nodes | | | (opt.+ | | | nodes | | | | | | network) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | +------*-----+ | +------*-----+ | +------*-----+ | +----|-------+ +----|-------+ +----|-------+ | | | | | | +---------------------+--------------------+ Private (or mesh) network **Note:** Since 5.1 compute node not needed external (public) interface. This interface appear on Compute, Cinder, Ceph nodes only if specified its necessity. Unfortanly, native rescheduling made only for router functionallity. Because for DHCP-agents we should using our custom old method of rescheduling. Or try use solution ""D"" -- year ago I tested it and found some problem when guest OS served by many DHCP servers. I propose following roadmap for implementing this feature: * (fuel-library team) **Making ""Network node"" role as dedicated role.** This role should be deployed as part of controller, or as a independed role. * (UI/Nailgun team) **Support ""Network node"" role.** While controller adding, ""Network node"" role should adding automatically. If env already contains two or more nodes with role ""Network node"", this role may be deleted from any node. While we adding ""Network node"" role to the node, Nailgun should check existence of public (br-ex) interface on this node. * (fuel-library team) **Disable our custom rescheduling mechanics for L3-agent.** Instead this we will use Neutron native rescheduling. * (fuel-library team) **Implement multiple DHCP-agent for virtual networks.** * (fuel-library team) Remove (or modify) out custom mechanics for rescheduling DHCP-agents. Patch ""B"" --------- DVR -- Distributed Virtual router. Allow us pass Floating IP (**and only floating**) traffic through public interface on Compute node. Non floating IP traffic continues to pass through Controllers (or additional network nodes, if we implements this feature). Shure, DVR feature required public interface on Compute node. Therefore this solution not suitable for customers, which requires maximal isolate env nodes from outside world (e.g. isolate Compute nodes). DVR -- is a controversial solution. This solution has some limitations. E.g. DVR doesn’t work with VLAN segmentation, only with tunneling and L2population. But for clouds, where dominated floating traffic and no strict security requirements -- it's a good solution. I can't recommend this solution as default way for virt.networking in MOS. But it's a good addition solution, that may be lightly implemented as yet another virt.network use case. I propose following roadmap for implementing this feature: * xxx Patch ""C"" --------- I have some doubt, that this patch coming in Juno. But work in this direction is underway, requests on review. Potencially it should forcely improve HA in virt.networking. Using VRRP should disable out of service time. Moreover this patch should allow us propose to customer virt.network scheme with regionally spaced network nodes:: +--------------+ / \ +-------------------> * Floating network * <---------------------+ | \ / | | +--------------+ | | | | | |ex. | | |ex. +-------+----+ . +------------+ +------------+ . +-------*----+ | |-+ | | |-+ | |-+ | | |-+ | dedicated | | . | Controller | | | Compute | | . | dedicated | | | Network | | | | nodes | | | nodes | | | | Network | | | nodes | | . | | | | | | . | nodes | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | DC-I | | . | | | | | | . | DC-II | | +------*-----+ | | +------*-----+ | +------*-----+ | | +------*-----+ | +----|-------+ . +----|-------+ +----|-------+ . +----|-------+ | | | | | | | . | | . | +----------------------+------------------+----------------------+ .

Most notably, objects are not promoted into the cache tier by a single read; they must be found to be sufficiently hot before that happens. * Monitor performance: the monitors now perform writes to the local data store asynchronously, improving overall responsiveness. * For a new feature this might be use cases.

Problem description =================== For teleco customers, Neutron networking alone is not sufficent, and many operators are considering deploying a dedicated SDN solution such as OpenContrial or OpenDaylight. The OPNFV group are specifically focusing on creating a reference implmentation based on Openstack and OpenDaylight (ODL). Since the icehouse release of Openstack the ODL driver has been included in the Openstack distribution. The problem is that when Fuel provisions the networks it sets up the admin, public, management, storage networks all on OpenvSwitch (using bridges and ports). ODL works by managing the OpenvSwitches, but as the management interface is on the Openvswitch communication breaks down when setting the ovs manager on compute nodes. Compare this to RDO, RHOS or devstack, where Openvswitch is only used for the data (private) networks. Proposed change =============== After the blueprints [0] and [1] mentioned above would be implemented, there will be a possibility to enable both features deployed simultaneously. It's mostly an administrative work needed because all the manifests will be ready, and we need just to allow a simultaneous use of the features somewhere in Release description. Include OpenDaylight in the packages to be installed on the controller. By default ODL uses some ports that conflict with swift (8080). These would need updated if swift was used. The modules that take care of setting up networking would have to configure the management interface outside of openvswitch, so that the controller node can manage remote vswitches. Alternatives ------------ N/A Data model impact ----------------- No data models modifications needed. REST API impact --------------- No REST API modifications needed. Upgrade impact -------------- The ODL controller is a seperate release from Openstack. One option maybe to have a seperate ODL controller deployed, prior to setting up Openstack, although many people are deploying the SDN controller on the Openstack controller nodes. Security impact --------------- No additional security modifications needed. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- Changes to puppet modules, to setup networking as reuired.

Any service (VM) that uses the mirrored data is attached to the port. .. code-block:: python 'tap_services': { 'id': {'allow_post': False, 'allow_put': False, 'validate': {'type:uuid': None}, 'is_visible': True, 'primary_key': True}, 'tenant_id': {'allow_post': True, 'allow_put': False, 'validate': {'type:string': None}, 'required_by_policy': True, 'is_visible': True}, 'name': {'allow_post': True, 'allow_put': True, 'validate': {'type:string': None}, 'is_visible': True, 'default': ''}, 'description': {'allow_post': True, 'allow_put': True, 'validate': {'type:string': None}, 'is_visible': True, 'default': ''}, 'port_id': {'allow_post': True, 'allow_put': False, 'validate': {'type:uuid': None}, 'is_visible': True}, 'network_id': {'allow_post': True, 'allow_put': False, 'validate': {'type:uuid': None}, 'is_visible': False} } TapFlow ------- TapFlow Represents the port from which the traffic needs to be mirrored. .. code-block:: python 'tap_flows': { 'id': {'allow_post': False, 'allow_put': False, 'validate': {'type:uuid': None}, 'is_visible': True, 'primary_key': True}, 'tenant_id': {'allow_post': True, 'allow_put': False, 'validate': {'type:string': None}, 'required_by_policy': True, 'is_visible': True}, 'name': {'allow_post': True, 'allow_put': True, 'validate': {'type:string': None}, 'is_visible': True, 'default': ''}, 'description': {'allow_post': True, 'allow_put': True, 'validate': {'type:string': None}, 'is_visible': True, 'default': ''}, 'tap_service_id': {'allow_post': True, 'allow_put': False, 'validate': {'type:uuid': None}, 'required_by_policy': True, 'is_visible': True}, 'source_port': {'allow_post': True, 'allow_put': False, 'validate': {'type:uuid': None}, 'required_by_policy': True, 'is_visible': True}, 'direction': {'allow_post': True, 'allow_put': False, 'validate': {'type:string': direction_enum}, 'is_visible': True} } direction_enum = [None, 'IN', 'OUT', 'BOTH'] Multiple TapFlow instances can be associated with a single TapService instance. API REFERENCE ============= Below is the list of REST APIs that can be used to interact with TaaS Neutron extension 1.

Delete TapFlow \ **DELETE /v2.0/taas/tap-flows/{tap_flow_uuid}** \ The TaaS client can be used to send REST request and interact with the TaaS extension. For usage type **taas --help** in the terminal after TaaS has been installed. Work Flow ========= In this section we describe a simple sequence of steps to use TaaS. Work Flow Sequence ------------------ 1. Create a Neutron port with 'port_security' set to 'disabled'. 2. Launch a VM (VM on which you want to monitor/receive the mirroed data). Assoiciate the Neutron port created in step 1 while creating the VM. 3. Create a Tap Service instance by associating the port created in step 1. 4. Create a Tap Flow instance by associating the tap service instance created in step 3 and Neutron port from which you want to mirror traffic (assuming the Neutron port from which the traffic needs to be monitored already exists) 5. Observer the mirroed traffic on the monitoring VM by running tools such as tcpdump. You can watch our tech talk session which included a live demo for more information about using TaaS, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cAkRUB3TCE ",,263,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =========================== Fuel Pluggable Architecture =========================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/nailgun-plugins Problem description =================== Our product is already able to install OpenStack in some default configurations. But there are a lot of additional features our users want. It is almost impossible to leave all of them in Fuel Core, so we need pluggable architecture to implement certain things as separate parts. Also there may be bundled versions of Fuel including exact plugins user wants. As a first step, this architecture will probably include these points: * Ability to install additional packages on target nodes * Ability to run custom shell commands on target nodes * Cinder drivers * Neutron drivers * Extending UI Also, we need to provide well-documented SDK and instructions on how to write custom Fuel plugin and to distribute it. Proposed change =============== There are already: Basic infrastructure for plugins (described below): https://review.openstack.org/97827 https://review.openstack.org/110288 A plugin prototype for Ceph: https://review.openstack.org/104608 From Nailgun side prototype uses `Stevedore <http://stevedore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.. This package is already used in OpenStack Nova project as hooks providing mechanism. It uses 'entry points' approach provided by setuptools/distutils, which basically allows to lookup and execute code from Python packages known to expose certain functionality. Advantages: * well-known and widely used solution * provides three basic types: Driver, Hook and Extension * allows to ""query"" installed Python packages to find plugins which implement certain features * flexible error processing and logging * used by a number of OpenStack projects Disadvantages: * approach used in prototype requires a lot of entry points to be specified in plugin's setup.py (this may be improved as well, additional research is needed) * needs very clear description for each hook which arguments does it accept and what format should returned value be in * some probable issues with merging results provided by different plugins implementing the same hook * need to restart Nailgun process after plugin was installed (if it's done dynamically on working master node) Alternatives ------------ Without Stevedore it may be written by hand, using dynamic reload() or the same entry points. Though, it is a production-grade solution already. Data model impact ----------------- Plugins will rely on their own DB table in PostgreSQL, which will be similar to key-value storage (using native JSON field). This allows them to store any custom structures, also we won't have a headache with writing migrations. In current approach, all plugin-related data is stored in this ""storage"", including custom roles, volumes/partitions and so on. Nailgun executes code from plugins through hooks and updates it's data by returned values. REST API impact --------------- API Serializers execute hooks while serializing DB model, extending JSON with data returned from plugins. Hooks are added to certain fields only, so risk of any massive incompatible API modification is minimal, but not completely impossible. Also, plugins may provide custom URLs matching ** /api/plugins/plugin_name/* ** scheme. This is done by inheriting from RESTAPIPlugin class and exposing WSGI application written in any web framework via *application* attribute. Upgrade impact -------------- Each plugin has to be tested and approved to work with current Fuel version. Backward compatibility should also be provided, meaning code should work with old environments on new Fuel version, if needed. Performance Impact ------------------ Performance decrease will surely depend on the number of plugins to execute. There is almost nothing we can do about that. Other deployer impact --------------------- Each plugin, depending on what it does, should be provided as one or multiple RPM packages, which will be installed into corresponding Docker containers. All plugins will be installed simultaneously, but user should be able to select which of them to use during environment creation process. Developer impact ---------------- From Nailgun side, plugin will be introduced as one or multiple Python packages. Each such package should include entry points in setup.py and its own tests. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- nmarkov@mirantis.com, akislitsky@mirantis.com Work Items ---------- Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Each plugin should have its own tests written using tox, unittests, casperjs, Selenium or some other corresponding testing framework. Documentation Impact ==================== In most common cases documentation may be presented by Sphinx docs, some RST files or just README.txt. ",,156,0

The reason for this is that the tool used to review specs is .. based purely on plain text. Plain text will allow review to proceed without .. having to look at additional files which can not be viewed in gerrit. It .. will also allow inline feedback on the diagram itself. Problem description =================== A detailed description of the problem: * For a new feature this might be use cases. Ensure you are clear about the actors in each use case: End User vs Deployer * For a major reworking of something existing it would describe the problems in that feature that are being addressed. Proposed change =============== Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How do you propose to solve this problem? If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In other words, what's the scope of this effort? Alternatives ------------ What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one. Data model impact ----------------- Changes which require modifications to the data model often have a wider impact on the system. The community often has strong opinions on how the data model should be evolved, from both a functional and performance perspective. It is therefore important to capture and gain agreement as early as possible on any proposed changes to the data model. Questions which need to be addressed by this section include: * What new data objects and/or database schema changes is this going to require? * What database migrations will accompany this change. * How will the initial set of new data objects be generated, for example if you need to take into account existing instances, or modify other existing data describe how that will work. REST API impact --------------- Each API method which is either added or changed should have the following * Specification for the method * A description of what the method does suitable for use in user documentation * Method type (POST/PUT/GET/DELETE) * Normal http response code(s) * Expected error http response code(s) * A description for each possible error code should be included describing semantic errors which can cause it such as inconsistent parameters supplied to the method, or when an instance is not in an appropriate state for the request to succeed. Errors caused by syntactic problems covered by the JSON schema defintion do not need to be included. * URL for the resource * Parameters which can be passed via the url * JSON schema definition for the body data if allowed * JSON schema definition for the response data if any * Example use case including typical API samples for both data supplied by the caller and the response * Discuss any policy changes, and discuss what things a deployer needs to think about when defining their policy. Upgrade impact -------------- If this change set concerns any kind of upgrade process, describe how it is supposed to deal with that stuff. For example, Fuel currently supports upgrading of master node, so it is necessary to describe whether this patch set contradicts upgrade process itself or any working feature that we need to support. Security impact --------------- Describe any potential security impact on the system. Some of the items to consider include: * Does this change touch sensitive data such as tokens, keys, or user data? * Does this change alter the API in a way that may impact security, such as a new way to access sensitive information or a new way to login? * Does this change involve cryptography or hashing? * Does this change require the use of sudo or any elevated privileges? * Does this change involve using or parsing user-provided data? This could be directly at the API level or indirectly such as changes to a cache layer. * Can this change enable a resource exhaustion attack, such as allowing a single API interaction to consume significant server resources? Some examples of this include launching subprocesses for each connection, or entity expansion attacks in XML. For more detailed guidance, please see the OpenStack Security Guidelines as a reference (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/Guidelines). These guidelines are a work in progress and are designed to help you identify security best practices. For further information, feel free to reach out to the OpenStack Security Group at openstack-security@lists.openstack.org. Notifications impact -------------------- Please specify any changes to notifications. Be that an extra notification, changes to an existing notification, or removing a notification. Other end user impact --------------------- Aside from the API, are there other ways a user will interact with this feature? * Does this change have an impact on python-fuelclient? What does the user interface there look like? Performance Impact ------------------ Describe any potential performance impact on the system, for example how often will new code be called, and is there a major change to the calling pattern of existing code. Examples of things to consider here include: * A periodic task might look like a small addition but if it calls conductor or another service the load is multiplied by the number of nodes in the system. * Scheduler filters get called once per host for every instance being created, so any latency they introduce is linear with the size of the system. * A small change in a utility function or a commonly used decorator can have a large impacts on performance. * Calls which result in a database queries (whether direct or via conductor) can have a profound impact on performance when called in critical sections of the code. * Will the change include any locking, and if so what considerations are there on holding the lock? Other deployer impact --------------------- Discuss things that will affect how you deploy and configure Fuel that have not already been mentioned, such as: * What config options are being added? Should they be more generic than proposed? Are the default values ones which will work well in real deployments? * Is this a change that takes immediate effect after its merged, or is it something that has to be explicitly enabled? * If this change is a new binary, how would it be deployed? * Please state anything that those doing continuous deployment, or those upgrading from the previous release, need to be aware of. Also describe any plans to deprecate configuration values or features. For example, if we change the directory name that instances are stored in, how do we handle instance directories created before the change landed? Do we move them? Do we have a special case in the code? Do we assume that the operator will recreate all the instances in their cloud? Developer impact ---------------- Discuss things that will affect other developers working on Fuel, such as: * If the blueprint proposes a change to the driver API, discussion of how drivers would implement the feature is required. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: <launchpad-id or None> Other contributors: <launchpad-id or None> Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Dependencies ============ * Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in fuel, or in other projects, that this one either depends on or is related to. * If this requires functionality of another project that is not currently used by Fuel, document that fact. * Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not included in Fuel? Or does it depend on a specific version of library? Testing ======= Please discuss how the change will be tested. It is assumed that unit test coverage will be added so that doesn't need to be mentioned explicitly, but discussion of why you think unit tests are sufficient and we don't need to add more functional tests would need to be included. Is this untestable in gate given current limitations (specific hardware / software configurations available)? If so, are there mitigation plans (3rd party testing, gate enhancements, etc). Documentation Impact ==================== What is the impact on the docs team of this change? Some changes might require donating resources to the docs team to have the documentation updated. Don't repeat details discussed above, but please reference them here. References ========== Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any reference. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are: * Links to mailing list or IRC discussions * Links to relevant research, if appropriate * Related specifications as appropriate * Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to ",,314,0

Because of this, Fuel must be able to ping the default gateway in order to deploy the environment. If your configuration does not include a pingable default gateway, you can work around it by specifying the Fuel Master node (or any other pingable host) as the default gateway. Alternatively, you can apply `Patch 138448 <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/138448>`_ to disable the requirement to ping the default gateway. After applying this patch, you need to enable it with following sequence of steps. Download environment deployment settings via Fuel CLI (replace ""1"" with the id of your environment):: fuel --env 1 deployment default Add ""run_ping_checker: 'false'"" to the end of the settings YAML file for every controller:: for f in deployment_1/*controller*.yaml; do echo ""run_ping_checker: 'false'"" >> $f done Upload updated settings (also using the right environment id):: fuel --env 1 deployment upload See `LP1396126 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1396126>`_.

This commit is done incrementally to provide a full audit trail
of the actions taken.  No content or editorial changes are made
in this CR; formatting and cross-reference changes that are required
to get the docs to build have been implemented but nothing else.

The steps taken have been outlined below.

-Move fuel-web/docs/develop to fuel-docs/pages/develop, and set
up title-specific control files: develop.rst,
contents/contents-develop.rst, pdf/pdf_develop.rst.  Also added
title to contents.rst file and moved the contents of
develop/_images to _images/develop. Renamed content files to
begin with numbers, underscores replaced with hyphens.

-added title to control files for the set -- index.rst,
pdf/conf.py.  Also fixed a couple typos in file names.

-fixed a lot of internal xrefs that were done using :doc:, broke
up some lines that were around 200 characters long

-fixed header levels so they match the way things were displayed
before the move.  This involved getting rid of the
nailgun/tree.rst file (the sourcing is now done directly from the
20000.nailgun.rst file) and editing the files to use the header
coding that fuel-docs uses.

-README.md - added new dependencies and path to plantuml to match
CI environment, UML diagrams now render in PDFs

Each code change MUST be covered with tests. The test for specific code change must fail if that change to code is reverted, i.e. the test must really cover the code change and not the general case. Bug fixes should have tests for failing case. #. The tests MUST be in the same patchset with the code changes. #. It's permitted not to write tests in extreme cases. The extreme cases are: * hot-fix / bug-fix with *Critical* status. * patching during Feature Freeze (FF_) or Hard Code Freeze (HCF_). In this case, request for writing tests should be reported as a bug with *technical-debt* tag. It has to be related to the bug which was fixed with a patchset that didn't have the tests included. .. _FF: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/FeatureFreeze .. _HCF: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/Hard_Code_Freeze #. Before writing tests please consider which type(s) of testing is suitable for the unit/module you're covering. #. Test coverage should not be decreased. #. Nailgun application can be sliced up to tree layers (Presentation, Object, Model). Consider usage of the unit testing if it is performed within one of the layers or implementing mock objects is not complicated. #. The tests have to be isolated. The order and count of executions must not influence test results. #. Tests must be repetitive and must always pass regardless of how many times they are run. #. Parametrize tests to avoid testing many times the same behaviour but with different data. This gives an additional flexibility in the methods' usage. #. Follow DRY principle in tests code. If common code parts are present, please extract them to a separate method/class. #. Unit tests are grouped by namespaces as corresponding unit. For instance, the unit is located at: ``nailgun/db/dl_detector.py``, corresponding test would be placed in ``nailgun/test/unit/nailgun.db/test_dl_detector.py`` #. Integration tests are grouped at the discretion of the developer. #. Consider implementing performance tests for the cases: * new handler is added which depends on number of resources in the database. * new logic is added which parses/operates on elements like nodes.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Substitution Cobbler with OpenStack Ironic ========================================== TODO: actual link to a blueprint https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/example Problem description =================== Currently we have working image based provisioning scheme which uses Fuel Agent on a node side to do advanced partitioning, download images and put them on a hard drive. The next logical step is to get rid of provisioning scheme based on native installers like anaconda and debian-installer and stop wasting resources for maintaining them. Cobbler seems to be an extra component in the case because it has many features which we don't need if we use image based scheme only. However, Cobbler manages DHCP, DNS, TFTP services on a master node and those services are needed for image based scheme as well. Fortunately, OpenStack has Ironic in its core which is capable to do the same. Ironic has PXE booting support, IPMI/ILO based power management. Ironic can manage DHCP and DNS (maybe via Neutron). Besides, Ironic is an implementation of server side of image based provisioning for bare metal in OpenStack. That is exactly what we need instead of Cobbler. Proposed change =============== TODO: sequence diagram 1) Ironic -> Default TFTP configuration (all unknown nodes boot with bootstrap ramdisk) 2) TFTP -> PXE boot with Fuel Agent + Nailgun Agent 3) Nailgun Agent -> Nailgun (discovery data) 4) Nailgun -> Astute (provisioning data) 5) Astute -> Ironic (add node) 6) Astute -> Ironic (deploy node) 7) Ironic -> Fuel Agent (put /tmp/provision.json and run /usr/bin/provision) 8) Ironic -> Astute (provisioning done, GET request) To make Ironic able to interact with Fuel Agent (put provision.json and run /usr/bin/provision) we need to implement corresponding Ironic driver. It should be able to create default TFTP configuration so as to make all new unknown nodes booting with bootstrap ramdisk where Fuel Agent (provisioning) and Nailgun Agent (discovery) are installed. That is exactly like current default system in Cobbler. Then a node boots with this bootstrap ramdisk and Nailgun Agent sends hardware info to Nailgun REST API. Nailgun is able to append this node to a cluster. Nailgun sends provisioning info to Astute via AMQP and waits for provisioning is done. It is not supposed to change current provisioning data format. Astute is going to convert those data into Ironic format if necessary. Astute adds node info into Ironic via its REST API, chooses FuelAgentDriver and sets driver_info according to provisioning data gotten from Nailgun. It then calls deploy Ironic REST method to start actual provisioning. We need to implement ruby Ironic binding and then use this binding in Astute for interacting with Ironic. Ironic then needs to put provisioning data (driver_info) into /tmp/provision.json file on a node. The format is supposed to differ from Nailgun format, so we need to implement corresponding Fuel Agent data driver (part of Fuel Agent). Currently Fuel Agent can parse Nailgun format only. Ironic then runs /usr/bin/provision entry point and waits for it to finish and return exit code. TODO: describe how to manage DHCP and DNS As far as we are going to get rid of native OS installers we need to remove radio button on Fuel web UI which currently allows user to choose between two ways of installing OS. * Implement Ironic driver for Fuel Agent The majority of Ironic functionality is implemented as drivers. Currently it has PXE, IPMI, IPA (Ironic Python Agent) drivers and we need to have the same for Fuel Agent. * Implement Puppet module for Ironic deployment. We need to be able to deploy Ironic on a master node, so we need to have a corresponding Puppet module. * Implement Docker container for Ironic. We have all major master node components packed into Docker containers. So we need to do Alternatives ------------ Cobbler has plenty of features and we don't need most of them if we get rid of native OS installers. However, we need some service to manage DHCP, DNS and TFTP services. Alternative to using Ironic is to implement our own standalone service or add corresponding capabilities info Astute. Data model impact ----------------- * It is not supposed to change data models neither in Nailgun nor in Ironic. REST API impact --------------- * It is not supposed to change REST API neither in Nailgun nor in Ironic. Upgrade impact -------------- It is planned to substitude cobbler docker container with ironic one and save TFTP configuration (cobbler default system, systems for particular nodes). It is also supposed to save DHCP and DNS configurations. We also need to disable radio button which allows one to choose between two ways of provisioning. Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- Provisioning way radio button is going to be removed. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: <vkozhukalov@mirantis.com> <agordeev@mirantis.com> Work Items ---------- - Fuel Agent driver for Ironic. [1]_ - Ironic Ruby binding (Fog) for using it in Astute. - Ironic driver for Astute. - Ironic data driver for Fuel Agent. (apart from Nailgun driver) - Ironic Puppet module. - Ironic Docker container. - Ironic related stuff in upgrade script. Dependencies ============ TODO: include Ironic spec TODO: openstack ruby binding TODO: ironic as a project Testing ======= Please discuss how the change will be tested. It is assumed that unit test coverage will be added so that doesn't need to be mentioned explicitly, but discussion of why you think unit tests are sufficient and we don't need to add more functional tests would need to be included. Is this untestable in gate given current limitations (specific hardware / software configurations available)? If so, are there mitigation plans (3rd party testing, gate enhancements, etc). Acceptance criteria ------------------- Documentation Impact ==================== It is necessary to re-write those parts of Fuel documentation which are about provisioning and about Fuel architecture.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Network verification service ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/network-verify-service Current network verification architecture has strong integration with nailgun which performs another function such as deployment configuration service. In future scaling network verification functionality like adding new tasks for verify can be hard implemented and support. Also now it has very pure output information like what’s going behind the scene for client. Base on SOP it wiil be logically to move network verification functionality into separate service. Problem description =================== * Network verification feature is independent enough to stop keeping the code in Nailgun/Astute and complicating them with it. * It not so easy to extend verification with new checking task. * Future scale of curent implementation will be hard to support. * It doesn't support bonds checking. * Results of tests in case of failures are discouraging now. It doesn't try to collapse the results somehow (a single foreign DHCP server produces a separate message for each node in cloud). Proposed change =============== * Create separate service to run tasks with different kind of checks for network. * It should provide an easy way to understand which checks are available to a cluster, which is running right now, and what are the results of checks in past. * There should be a way to run not all of them but certain checks only.

If you are registered at the `official Mirantis website <https://www.mirantis.com/>`_ you will receive regular email notifications on the available patches in an aggregate form. Once you receive the email, you can click on the patching items listed there. This will lead you to the errata portal <http://errata.mirantis.com/>`_. At the portal you will see a list of all the available patches. Each patching item will have detailed instructions on how to download and apply each of them. Configuring repositories ======================== By default your environments will have configuration of repositories that point to default Mirantis mirrors of update and security repositories. Also there will be an 'Auxiliary' repository configured on the master node which one could use for to deliver packages to the nodes. If you would like to alter the list of repositories, you will need to change this list to the one you prefer. There are 3 fields which contain requried information for repositories configuration depending on distribution you are installing. For Centos ********** |repo-name|repo-baseurl|repo-priority| e.g. my-repo http://my-domain.local/repo 10 For Ubuntu ********** |repo-name|apt-sources-list-string|repo-priority| my-repo deb http://my-domain.local/repo trusty main 1200 Here priority of repository means that repository with highest number overrides ones with lowest numbers for Ubuntu. However, it is vice-versa for CentOS For more info on repo configuration please refer to the corresponding distro's package manager guides. ",,136,2

If the intended branch is not present, bootstrap it:

- mark the new migration script with proper branch label;
- make the script down_revision == None to indicate it's a new branch;

One missing thing is making the script depends_on the previous release

The merge commits created by zuul do not always list all of the files
being modified, so use git diff instead of git show.

Also force python to use unbuffered I/O so the output comes out in a
useful order instead of mixed up with the subprocess commands.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================================= API to Mount and Unmount Manila Shares to Sahara Clusters ========================================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sahara/+spec/mount-share-api As OpenStack's shared file provisioning service, manila offers great integration potential with sahara, both for shared binary storage and as a data source. While it seems unnecessary to wrap manila's share provisioning APIs in sahara, allowing users to easily mount shares to all nodes of a Sahara cluster in a predictable way will be a critical convenience feature for this integration. Problem description =================== Manually mounting shares to every node in a large cluster would be a tedious and error-prone process. Auto-mounting shares that are requested for use in either the data source or binary storage case might be feasible for some use cases. However, outside of our (optional) EDP interface this functionality would never be usable. As such, it is best to provide the user an API for mounting of shares onto Sahara clusters. Proposed change =============== This change proposes to expand the cluster template and cluster API resources and database objects to contain a ""shares"" field. At the resource level, this field will be defined by the following jsonschema: ""shares"": { ""type"": ""array"", ""items"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""id"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""format"": ""uuid"", }, ""path"": { ""type"": ""string"" }, ""processes"": { ""type"": ""array"", ""items"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""minLength"": 1 } }, ""read"": { ""type"": ""boolean"" }, ""write"": { ""type"": ""boolean"" } }, ""additionalProperties"": False, ""required"": [ ""id"" ] } } ""id"" above refers to the UUID of the manila share to be mounted. It is required. ""path"" refers to the local path on each cluster node on which to mount this share, which should be universal across all nodes of the cluster for simplicity. It will default to ``/mnt/{share_id}``. ""processes"" refers to the set of cluster processes which require the share. The share will be mounted to the set of cluster nodes which run at least one of the listed processes. By default (in the case of no processes key or a processes key with a False boolean value,) the share will be mounted to all nodes regardless of role. ""read"" and ""write"" govern permissions set in manila for the cluster ips. Both default to ""true"". Note that it is possible that the same share id will appear multiple times in the share list, but different process lists and different permission settings. For sanity, any node will be granted all permissions that are appropriate for any of its processes. Because no part of this field requires indexing, it is proposed that the above structure be directly serialized to the database as a TEXT field in JSON format. Error cases in this API include: 1) The provided id is not a valid manila share id (as assessed via manilaclient with the user's credentials.) 2) Any invalid process for the cluster type is provided in the processes list. 3) The provided path is not a valid, absolute Linux path. 4) Multiple manila share ids are mapped to the same Linux path. 5) On any share, neither read nor write is true. 6) The provided id maps to a manila share which sahara is not currently equipped to mount. 7) No manila service endpoint exists within the user's service catalog. On cluster creation (or update, if update becomes an available endpoint,) just after the cluster becomes available and before delegating to the plugin (such that any shares intended for HDFS integration will be in place for the plugin configuration to act upon,) Sahara will execute a share mounting step. For each share, Sahara will take the following steps: 1) Query the cluster object to find internal ip addresses for all cluster nodes running any processes for which the share should be mounted (or all processes in the default case.) 2) For each such node, call to manila to allow access for each ip according to the permissions set on the share. (See note above about permissions in the multiple-process case.) 3) Sahara will query manila for share information, including share type and defaults. 4) Sahara will make a remote call to each qualifying node and mount the share via its mount address as returned from manila. Steps 1-3 above will be handled via common code in an abstract ShareMounter class. The last step will be delegated to a concrete instance of this class, based on share type as reported by manila, which will execute appropriate command-line operations over a remote socket to mount the share. The reference and test implementation for the first revision of this feature will only provide an NFS mounter. An HDFS mounter is the next logical step, but this feature set is already being worked on in parallel to this change and falls outside of the scope of this specification. Unmounting is a natural extension of this class, but is not covered in this specification. Alternatives ------------ A more-seamless approach to manila share storage and data sourcing could be attempted, in which no API is exposed to the user, and shares are automatically mounted and unmounted when resources on the share in question are needed (as referenced in a data source URL or binary storage path). However, giving the user the ability to mount and unmount shares at will may allow use cases which we do not anticipate, and particularly in the context of usage of a sahara- provisioned cluster without use of the EDP API, the new API is critical. It would also be possible to attempt to wrap manila share creation (or even share network creation or network router configuration) in sahara. It seems reasonable, however, to assert that this would be an overstep of our charter, and that asking users to create shares directly through manila will allow them much fuller and up-to-date access to manila's feature set. On the sahara implementation side, it would be possible to create a new 'share' resource and table, for ease of update and compositional modelling. However, shares will likely never be a top-level noun in sahara; it seems that a field is a better fit for the degree of share management we intend to undertake than an entire resource. It should be noted that this specification does not attempt to deal with the question of filesystem driver installation across n distributions of Linux and m filesystem types; such an effort is better suited to many specifications and change sets than one. For the first stage of this effort, NFS will be used as the test reference filesystem type. Note that both binary storage and data source integration are intentionally not handled here. A binary storage specification will build on this spec, but this spec is being posted independently such that the engineers working on data source integration can propose revisions to only the changes relevant to their needs. Data model impact ----------------- A new 'shares' TEXT field will be added to both clusters and cluster templates. REST API impact --------------- A new 'shares' field will be added to the resource for both clusters and cluster templates. This field will only allow create functionality in the initial change, as cluster update is currently a sticking point in our API. Other end user impact --------------------- Python-saharaclient will need to be made aware of the new shares field on cluster and cluster template creation. Deployer impact --------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- None. Sahara-image-elements impact ---------------------------- None for the initial change; addition of specialized fs drivers in the future may require image changes. Sahara-dashboard / Horizon impact --------------------------------- The share mounting feature in Horizon will likely require a separate tab on both affected resources, and is left for a separate spec. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: egafford Secondary assignee/reviewer: croberts Work Items ---------- * API Resource modification and call validation. * DB model modification and testing. * Manila client integration with Sahara. * Logical glue code on cluster provisioning. * ShareMounter abstraction and NFS impl. * Unit testing. * Integration testing as feasible (will require manila in CI env for full CI.) * Update of API WADL site. * Horizon changes (in separate spec). * Documentation. Dependencies ============ This feature introduces a new dependency on python-manilaclient. Testing ======= Unit testing is assumed; beyond this, full integration testing will depend on the feasibility of adding a manila endpoint to our CI environment. If this is feasible, then our testing path becomes clear; if it is not, then gated integration testing will not be possible. Documentation Impact ==================== This feature will require documentation in features.rst, and will drive changes to the api documentation.

This fixes two issues discovered when trying to reboot a devstack
host, which is similar to a full datacenter reboot.

First, the RUG currently tries to delete any existing non-alive VMs
it finds for a router.  Its failing to do that ATM, attempting to
use an ID from the wrong object.

With that fixed, the VM manager and state machine are still incapable of
removing and starting with a fresh appliance VM.  Currently, the pass
through the state machine that detects and deletes the existing VM counts
as a negative boot attempt and the execution does not clear its cached
instance_info after its deleted the instance.  This causes another pass
through the state with a stale instance_info that again counts against
the boot count.  That causes the router to get set to ERROR and future

This patch rolls up all the changes to the requirements repo that were
not altering globl requirements, so that we can use the library from
infra jobs targeting juno.

Juno specific fixups in the backport:

 - deal with older hacking rules
 - change test-requirements to require testtools capable of running the tests.
 - change the generate-requirements cross-check to not try to compile
   upper-constraints for 3.4 - g-r in kilo is not compatible with 3.4.

updated requirements repo readme

The purpose of the requirements repository, it's history, and
consistent review guidelines are something that's currently lore
passed down through the ages.

We should write this stuff down, and come up with consistent
guidelines for submitters and reviewers to get us all onto a single
page wrt reviewing and acceptance criteria.

implement -s / --soft-update flag

This provides a new flag to update.py which allows for a ""soft
update"", which updates all the requirements found in g-r to the g-r
specified versions, but lets any unknown lines pass through as is,
without warning. This makes the tool usable for ecosystem projects
that want to test with g-r versions of the g-r specified dependencies,
but also want to be able to add their own dependencies above and beyond.

Update only if version requirement has changed

Previously, if any change was made to a line, it would update the line. This
includes whitespace changes around comments on the line. See
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/144782/ for an example of a unhelpful update.

provide more meaningful output on update.py

In an attempt to make the proposal bot changes for requirements be
more meaningful make the update.py script return something that's more
user friendly.

Now by default the script will return the following to stdout on success:

Version change for: mox, mox3, testrepository, testtools
Updated project/test-requirements.txt:
    mox==0.5.3                     ->   mox>=0.5.3
    mox3==0.7.3                    ->   mox3>=0.7.0
    testrepository>=0.0.13         ->   testrepository>=0.0.17
    testtools>=0.9.27              ->   testtools>=0.9.32

Add a verbose flag that will provide much of the previous debug info.

Eliminate the giant dict dump of all the requirements files, as that
was largely impossible to make sense of, and rarely provided any
insight. During a devstack run you'll have git hashes for all the
trees, so can track down exact file contents if needed.

By making this the default stdout we can then capture and use this for
the git commit messages.

In order to make the test output matching human readable ignore the 80
column limit for the expected blocks via #noqa.

Remove requirements overlap check

The requirements overlap check was originally designed to address
a behavior introduced by our requirements-driven pypi mirror. Now
that we use full mirrors of pypi, it is no longer necessary and
is an artifical restriction that may cause problems for us.

Ic4dee3126dda2a25455235fea6a6574b64cd51a3 .

toposort implements a topological sort in Python. The above change
uses it to ensure correct ordering wrt referential integrity
constraints when reconstructing a MySQL schema from a cache during
unit tests.

The library is fairly simple. I would expect it to be updated rarely.

It is python 3 compatible.

It uses the Apache 2.0 licence.

It is not packaged for either Ubuntu or Fedora as of February 2015.

Its function is not covered by any other currently required library
that I'm aware of.

A feasible, but undesirable, alternative to using this package would
be to implement a topological sort function in OpenStack.

Do not break on projects without setup.cfg

setup.cfg is used by pbr instead of setup.py.
Projects not using pbr while not have setup.cfg at all
or will have it with completely different contents.

There's already a check in update.py whether or not
the target project is using pbr, but it relies on
presence of setup.cfg, which may not be the case.

After this patch update.py will try to read setup.cfg
only after it detected that pbr is used.

Allow testing with specific pips

We want to use the new resolver branch of pip today, and perhaps
develop in future too. This introduces the same basic change we did to
pbr's tests to test with a custom pip.

Consolidating redundant code in the tests

This moves things that are pretty much copy-paste into one place,
letting us focus on the actual differences amongst the tests.

I've also made the local test fixtures explicit, so we can see what
each test really needs, which has also eliminated redundant test
overhead, the slowest test is now 0.05s vs 0.1 before. This is more
than paid for by the reduced duplication in the basic setup, making
the patch a net reduction in LOC.

It also fixes the tempdir leak that was present in two of the test
scripts.

Introduce upper-constraints to requirements.

This is thoroughly documented in the cross project spec 'requirements

convergence and keep up to date.

This is a first approximation to the transitive union of requirements,
built by generate-constraints with python 2.7 and 3.4. It will be
updated by a periodic job (which we'll add shortly) proposing future
merges to this repository. Its not yet cross-checked for compatibility
with proposed global-requirements.txt changes, that will come later.

Having the file present now allows us to start working on the
consuming side in parallel and has no downsides, since no projects
jobs will be voting based on this until all the pieces are in place
and battle tested.

Prevent incompatible version bumps.

We shouldn't be able to bump global requirement versions if that
would be incompatible with the current test set of versions. To assess
'works' we need to run them in tests which means that we need to
update upper-constraints.txt at the same time. We don't test all
versions however, so just checking that the constraints version is
compatible with the updated global requirements is sufficient.

This adds a dependency on the pypa packaging library. The library is
maintained by the authors of setuptools and pip, is Apache V2, in good
condition and Python 3 ready. Its a test-only dependency so I don't
think the distro packaging status matters. This is *the* reference
library for packaging facilities on Python.

It looks like dnspython3 is a drop-in replacement for dnspython. Swift

dnspython3 doesn't work on Python 2: use an environment marker to only

It was enabled lately to vote, though stable branches do not contain the needed

It's not expected the branch will receive the needed backports to fix it
in Kilo, so the job is doomed to be useless and is better to be disabled

While at it, cleaned up an old entry to avoid the job for Icehouse since

It turns out that devstack does not apply post-config sections from
localrc but local.conf only [1]. Since devstack-gate uses the former to
configure setup, the hook was not applied.

ml2 plugin for devstack actually allows to pass the desired extensions
thru Q_ML2_PLUGIN_EXT_DRIVERS= variable, so let's use it instead of
making devstack post-config hooks localrc-aware.

This is already the third patch we have to enable the extensions in
gate. Sigh.

Our current projects.yaml file lists project teams and git
repositories associated to those. However, things we publish
as a single ""thing"" may be represented by multiple code
repositories. For example, a ""neutron"" release is actually made
of openstack/neutron and openstack/neutron-*aas. A ""sahara""
release is actually made of openstack/sahara, openstack/sahara-extra
and openstack/sahara-image-elements. Those are all tagged at the
same time with the same version number, and published together
as a single ""deliverable"".

This change proposes to encode this layer in the projects.yaml file.
It also proposes to apply tags to the deliverable level rather than
at git repository level. Tags are meant to apply to things that are
consumed by our users, not to the technical pieces that help us
build those things. Note that for most projects have single-repo
deliverables and won't really look different. See Sahara and Neutron
in the proposed file to see examples of multi-repo deliverables.

Since this introduces a breaking change in the file format, we also
take the opportunity to simplify the YAML format: since tags no
longer have attributes they can be listed as an array rather than
as a dictionary, sparing us the useless ""name:"" part.

This facilitates project development lifecycle transitions between

It has enabled projects to deeply interact with OpenStack in development and testing, whether they sought to become ""core"" OpenStack projects or not. This is an extremely valuable service that benefits our entire community, including new as well as established projects. With recent changes in project governance, the OpenStack project has opened itself to including a much wider range of projects under its umbrella. As such, the organizational barriers that necessitated the barrier between Stackforge and OpenStack are dissolving. Any project is welcome to join OpenStack as long as it is willing to follow the community and development practices outlined in the `Requirements for new OpenStack Projects applications`_, which are very similar to the kinds of things we informally expect of Stackforge projects. Because the resources provided by Stackforge are now more readily available under the umbrella of the OpenStack project itself, the Technical Committee requests that new projects apply to join OpenStack rather than requesting Stackforge repositories. The Infrastructure team is asked to stop accepting new Stackforge projects effective immediately. Existing Stackforge projects are requested to apply to become OpenStack projects and complete those transitions before July 1, 2017. This proposal is in no way intended to be a reduction in service, but rather a recognition that all of the projects in our community are working toward the same goal and with the same processes. They are all efforts of the OpenStack community. .. _Requirements for new OpenStack Projects applications: http://governance.openstack.org/reference/new-projects-requirements.html ",,40,0

Since we require pymongo>=3 the help string of mongodb_replica_set is wrong,
we don't longer use the MongoReplicaSetClient.

Also the replicaset can be passed through the uri like this :

  mongodb://db1.example.net,db2.example.net:2500/?replicaSet=test

So, this change deprecates this option.

To a layman, it permits a browser's javascript engine to access an API that does not reside on the same domain, protocol, or port. This feature is most useful to organizations which maintain one or more custom user interfaces for OpenStack, as it permits those interfaces to access the services directly, rather than requiring an intermediate proxy server. It can, however, also be misused by malicious actors; please review the security advisory below for more information. Enabling CORS_ via configuration -------------------------------- In most cases, CORS support is build directly into the service itself. To enable it, simply follow the configuration options exposed in the default configuration file, or add it yourself according to the pattern below.:: [cors] allowed_origin=https://first_ui.example.com max_age=3600 allow_methods=GET,POST,PUT,DELETE allow_headers=Content-Type,Cache-Control,Content-Language,Expires,Last-Modified,Pragma,X-Custom-Header expose_headers=Content-Type,Cache-Control,Content-Language,Expires,Last-Modified,Pragma,X-Custom-Header This method also permits you to define multiple permitted origins. To express this in your configuration file, first begin with a `[cors]` group as above, into which you place your default configuration values. Then, add as many additional configuration groups as necessary, naming them `[cors.{something}]` (each name must be unique). The purpose of the suffix to `cors.` is legibility, we recommend using a reasonable human-readable string:: [cors.ironic_webclient] # CORS Configuration for a hypothetical ironic webclient, which overrides # authentication allowed_origin=https://ironic.example.com:443 allow_credentials=True [cors.horizon] # CORS Configuration for horizon, which uses global options. allowed_origin=https://horizon.example.com:443 [cors.wildcard] # CORS Configuration for the CORS specified domain wildcard, which only # permits HTTP GET requests. allowed_origin=* allow_methods=GET Enabling CORS_ via pastedeploy ------------------------------ In the following services, CORS_ is configured via pastedeploy. In this case, you must first make sure that OpenStack's `oslo_middleware` package (version 2.3.0 or later) is available in the python environment that is running the service. Then, add the following configuration block to your paste.ini file.:: [filter:cors] paste.filter_factory = oslo_middleware.cors:filter_factory allowed_origin=https://website.example.com:443 max_age=3600 allow_methods=GET,POST,PUT,DELETE allow_headers=Content-Type,Cache-Control,Content-Language,Expires,Last-Modified,Pragma,X-Custom-Header expose_headers=Content-Type,Cache-Control,Content-Language,Expires,Last-Modified,Pragma,X-Custom-Header .. note:: To add another domain, simply add another filter. Security Concerns ----------------- CORS_ specifies a wildcard character `*`, which permits access to all user agents, regardless of domain, protocol, or host. While there are valid use cases for this approach, it also permits a malicious actor to create a convincing facsimile of a user interface, and trick users into revealing authentication credentials. Please carefully evaluate your use case, and the relevant documentation, for any risk to your organization. .. note:: The CORS_ specification does not support using this wildcard as part of a URI. Setting allowed-origin to `*` would work, while `*.openstack.org` would not. Troubleshooting --------------- CORS_ is very easy to get wrong, as even one incorrect property will violate the prescribed contract. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot your configuration. Check the service log ##################### The CORS middleware used by OpenStack provides verbose debug logging that should reveal most configuration problems. Here are some example log messages, and how to resolve them. `CORS request from origin 'http://foo.com' not permitted.` A request was received from the origin 'http://foo.com', however this origin was not found in the permitted list. The cause may be a superfluous port notation (ports 80 and 443 do not need to be specified). To correct, ensure that the configuration property for this host is identical to the host indicated in the log message. `Request method 'DELETE' not in permitted list: GET,PUT,POST` A user agent has requested permission to perform a DELETE request, however the CORS configuration for the domain does not permit this. To correct, add this method to the `allow_methods` configuration property. `Request header 'X-Custom-Header' not in permitted list: X-Other-Header` A request was received with the header 'X-Custom-Header', which is not permitted. Add this header to the `allow_headers` configuration property. Open your browser's console log ############################### Most browsers provide helpful debug output when a CORS request is rejected. Usually this happens when a request was successful, but the return headers on the request do not permit access to a property which the browser is trying to access. Manually construct a CORS request ################################# By using `curl` or a similar tool, you can trigger a CORS response with a properly constructed HTTP request. An example request and response might look like this:: Request: curl -I -X OPTIONS https://api.example.com/api -H ""Origin: https://ui.example.com"" Response: HTTP/1.1 204 No Content Content-Length: 0 Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://ui.example.com Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE Access-Control-Expose-Headers: origin,authorization,accept,x-total,x-limit,x-marker,x-client,content-type Access-Control-Allow-Headers: origin,authorization,accept,x-total,x-limit,x-marker,x-client,content-type Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600 If the service does not return any access control headers, check the service log for an indication on what went wrong. .. _CORS: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ ",,164,0

Development policies -------------------- The Nova community is a large community. We have lots of users, and they all have a lot of expectations around upgrade and backwards compatibility. For example, having a good stable API, with discoverable versions and capabilities is important for maintaining the strong ecosystem around Nova. Our process is always evolving, just as Nova and the community around Nova evolves over time. If there are things that seem strange, or you have ideas on how to improve things, please engage in that debate, so we continue to improve how the Nova community operates. This section looks at the processes and why. The main aim behind all the process is to aid good communication between all members of the Nova community, while keeping users happy and keeping developers productive. blueprints policies Architecture Concepts ---------------------- This follows on for the discussion in the introduction, and digs into details on specific parts of the Nova architecture. We find it important to document the reasons behind our architectural decisions, so its easier for people to engage in the debates about the future of Nova's architecture. This is all part of Open Design and Open Development. addmethod.openstackapi Architecture Evolution Plans ----------------------------- The following section includes documents that describe the overall plan behind groups of nova-specs. Most of these cover items relating to the evolution of various parts of Nova's architecture. Once the work is complete, these documents will move into the ""Concepts"" section.

This does a major refactor of code in test_servers to use instance
objects and generally mock things at the compute/api layer instead
of all the way down in the database layer.

It removes a few tests and conditions that were just testing DB
semantics from the highest levels.

This will be needed when we drop the flavor compatibility code from
the instance object, as these tests were mocking out the DB layer
with old-style instance structures.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Persist RequestSpec object ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/persist-request-spec Persist the RequestSpec object used for scheduling an instance. Problem description =================== There are a few times that it would be useful to have the RequestSpec used for originally scheduling an instance but it is no longer available, such as during a resize/migrate. In order to have later scheduling requests operate under the same constraints as the original we should retain the RequestSpec for these later scheduling calls. Going forward with cells it will be necessary to store a RequestSpec before an instance is created so that the API can return details on the instance before it has been scheduled. Use Cases --------- * Operators/users want to move an instance through a migration or resize and want the destination to satisfy the same requirements as the source. Project Priority ---------------- Priorities for Liberty have not yet been decided. Proposed change =============== A save_for_instance() method will be added to the RequestSpec object. This will store parts of the RequestSpec in the instance_extra table. The save() method is being saved for a later idea of persistence in the api database. Alternatives ------------ The entire RequestSpec could be persisted, but only some parts of it are not already persisted elsewhere. Much of it can be recreated from the instance being scheduled. Data model impact ----------------- A new column will be added to the instance_extra table. This column will hold the force_hosts, force_nodes, retry(should this be stored?), limits, group, and scheduler_hints fields from the object. ObjectFields will be stored as obj_to_primitive dicts containing object version information. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None here, but this will allow for resizes to be scheduled like the original boot request. Performance impact ------------------ An additional database write will be incurred. Other deployer impact --------------------- Same as for users, nothing here but this opens up future changes. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: alaski Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Add a new column to the instance_extra table * Add the save_for_instance() method to the RequestSpec object * Call the save_for_instance() method in the code at the appropriate place Dependencies ============ https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/request-spec-object Testing ======= New unit tests will be added.

We have a bunch of assertions like

    self.assertTrue(resp.status in (200, 204))

Sometimes we get smart about failure messages and have something like

    self.assertTrue(resp.status in (200, 204), resp.status)

Since we don't have to support Python 2.6 any more, we can use

Presently, the wsgi server allows persist connections hence even after the
response is sent to the client, it doesn't close the client socket connection.
Because of this problem, the green thread is not released back to the pool.

In order to close the client socket connection explicitly after the
response is sent and read successfully by the client, you simply have to
set keepalive to False when you create a wsgi server.

DocImpact:
Added wsgi_keep_alive option (default=True).
In order to maintain the backward compatibility, setting wsgi_keep_alive
as True by default. Recommended is set it to False.

Current behaviour results in 409 errors for innocent operations
while e.g. slow (I've seen up to 1.5 minutes) power operation is on.
This, for example, happens when Inspector is in use: the last action
it does is to power off the node. If it takes time, many operations
won't be possible on a node right after power action was requested.

The problem with this particular operation is that it fails with 409
without any retries on a server side.

This patch allows update request to reach conductor and to be retried
inside the task_manager.

called supported_qos_rule_types of list type.

For ml2, determine supported qos rule types as a subset of rule types
supported by all drivers. (In the future, we may expand the list to
include all types supported by at least one of enabled drivers. This
would require synchronized work with nova scheduler though.)

For ml2, tests are limited, and should be expanded to check that common
subset of qos rules is calculated properly when intersection != the list
of each plugins. For now, it's enough since we don't have more than one
rule type planned for Liberty.

Added API test for the resource.

We need the so-called management address of a GlusterFS
volume (ssh address of its management node) at a few places
for bookkeping reasons (certain data like GlusterFS version

So far it was available only through ad-hoc mangling of

Also fix an occurrence of ad-hoc mangling going wrong,
ie. where a wrongly constructed address is attempted

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================= Check the destination host when migrating ========================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/check-destination-on-migrations Provide a way to verify if a given destination host is valid when migrating. Problem description =================== Migrations (incl. evacuate, live but not cold migrate) allow the possibility to either specify a destination host or not. The former option totally bypasses the scheduler by calling the destination Compute RPC API directly. Unfortunately, there are some cases when migrating a VM, it breaks the scheduler rules so it makes some further boot requests potentially broken due to some constraints not enforced when migrating (like allocation ratios). As the current API method called ``select_destinations()`` only returns one destination per instance requested, there is no way to know if the destination host was a valid target. Use Cases ---------- As an operator, I would like to make sure that my destination is correct before migrating. Project Priority ----------------- Priorities are not defined yet, but it is related to the scheduler effort that was prioritized for Kilo. Proposed change =============== The blueprint will accordingly expose a new Scheduler RPC API method called ``check_my_destination()`` which will accept filter_properties and request_spec as regular arguments, plus the name of the compute node and will return True or False. The API for all migrations including a destination host will be modified to add an extra request body argument called ``check`` (accepting True or False) and the corresponding CLI methods will expose that ``check`` option. Alternatives ------------ A separate API endpoint like /os-scheduler/verify could accept a request body having an instance uuid and a destination host, but it would create a precedent for having a REST API related scheduler stuff while we are not ready yet. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- The proposed change just updates the POST request body for the ``os-migrateLive`` and ``evacuate`` actions to include the ``check`` boolean field defaulted to False if the request has a minimum version. If the migration is not valid, it would fail with an ``HTTPBadRequest`` error code, as if the migration was returning a ``NoValidHost``. * JSON schema definition for the body data of ``os-migrateLive``: :: migrate_live = { 'type': 'object', 'properties': { 'os-migrateLive': { 'type': 'object', 'properties': { 'block_migration': parameter_types.boolean, 'disk_over_commit': parameter_types.boolean, 'host': host, 'check': parameter_types.boolean }, 'required': ['block_migration', 'disk_over_commit', 'host'], 'additionalProperties': False, }, }, 'required': ['os-migrateLive'], 'additionalProperties': False, } * JSON schema definition for the body data of ``evacuate``: :: evacuate = { 'type': 'object', 'properties': { 'evacuate': { 'type': 'object', 'properties': { 'host': parameter_types.hostname, 'check': parameter_types.boolean, 'onSharedStorage': parameter_types.boolean, 'adminPass': parameter_types.admin_password, }, 'required': ['onSharedStorage'], 'additionalProperties': False, }, }, 'required': ['evacuate'], 'additionalProperties': False, } * The response data of both actions is not impacted by the change. As said above, this spec is only providing a new behaviour returning a 400 error code if the provided destination host is wrong. * There should be no policy change as we're not changing the action by itself but rather just providing a new option. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- Python-novaclient will accept a ``check`` option for the following methods : - evacuate - live-migrate Performance Impact ------------------ A new RPC call will be done if the check option is there before actually migrating but it shouldn't really impact the performance. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: sylvain-bauza Work Items ---------- - Add a new Scheduler API method called ``check_my_destination()`` and provide the according scheduler client method - Modify conductor methods for evacuate and live_migrate to call ``scheduler_client.check_my_destination()`` if there is a destination host provided and if a ``check`` argument defaulted to False is True - Extend the API (and bump a new version) to add a ``check`` attribute for both above actions - Add a new ``check`` option to python-novaclient and expose it in CLI for both ``evacuate`` and ``live-migrate`` commands Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= API samples will need to be updated and unittests will cover the behaviour but there is no need to further modify Tempest or the in-tree functional tests. Documentation Impact ==================== As said, API samples will be modified to include the new attribute. References ========== None ",,211,0

This patch fixes a portion of live migration problems
related to Fibre Channel based volumes.  The problem is
the libvirt volume driver for FC was storing a list of
devices it discovered in the connection_info at the bottom
end of connect_volume.   The connection_info is blown away
by nova at the start of the live migration process with the
call to the block_device refresh_connection_info.

This patch is an easy work around for the problem of the devices
going away.   The FC libvirt volume driver now doesn't rely
upon the devices list existing.  The FC driver now rebuilds
the list of possible devices that might show up, finds out what's
actually there, and then removes them

There's no point to place /boot partition on NVMe disk
as grub2 without UEFI support is unable to recognize it and
read any data from it.

Unfortunately, fuel-agent doesn't work with grub2-efi.
It always installs BIOS version of grub2.

It's just a work around that will allow to land /boot partition
on non-NVMe disk.

The absence of non-NVMe disks on a node will cause a failure of
provisioning.

We implement the method above with the purpose of using the
nova.libvirt.blockinfo primitives (which match how libvirt itself works),
to decide on which device name to use for an instance.

With this change - we will be using the libvirt local logic to decide on
the volume device name instead of relying on
nova.compute.utils.get_device_name_for_instance() which will do wrong
things in a number of cases.

Up until now, libvirt would default it's own device names unless they
were specified by the user at boot. This could lead to inconsistencies,
so the soft approach was to discourage users from passing in explicit
device names, by documenting the fact that they will not be honoured,
 but not override them.

It turns out that this approach causes more trouble, especially when we
add attaching volumes into the mix. So the approach now is to make
libvirt _always_ override what is passed in. That way even if the user
specifies a device name, the attach will not fail due to a device name
collision (a common problem - see related bug), and Nova book keeping
will match what we can see in the instance on most OSes.

In order to get there we now make sure boot starts acting like that
before we switch attach_volume over too, so that there is consistent
behavior.

Also - make tests for defaulting device names more realistic as they now
actually run the code instead of just making sure the right methods get
called.

UpgradeImpact: After this commit, supplying a device name for any of
the block devices specified as part of the `nova boot` call will not be
honoured by any libvirt compute nodes.

Infra team has indicated that tearDown methods should be replaced
with addCleanup in unit tests. The reason is that all addCleanup
methods will be executed even if one of them fails, while a failure
in tearDown method can leave the rest of the tearDown un-executed,
which can leave stale state laying around.

Moreover, tearDown methods won't run if an exception raises in setUp
method, while addCleanup will run in such case.

So, we should replace tearDown with addCleanup methods.

Discoverable capabilities was not added to swift until 1.11.0. Some

This config can be changed in `notification.yaml` file in `database` section. However you have to additionally install a database backend python package for a database of your choice. We'd suggest using `MySQL-Python` for MySQL and `python-psycopg2` for PostgreSQL. To install them run: pip install MySQL-Python or pip install python-psycopg2 Alternatively you can run: pip install monasca-notification[postgresql] or pip install monasca-notification[mysql] which will install mentioned database driver packages. Bare in mind that you may have to install system dependencies to make those packages compile. For `psycopg2` you would need: sudo apt-get install libpq-dev # for psycopg2 or: sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev # for mysql You can find more supported dialects in [SQLAlchemy docs](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/dialects/). ,,47,2

storm.

The problem is that the ENGINE list @edp/job_manager.py doesn't contain
the storm engine.
