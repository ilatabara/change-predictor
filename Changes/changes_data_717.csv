Problem Description =================== 1) As a cloud administrator I would like to simplify my deployment so that I don't have to manage a corosync and pacemaker per OpenStack API service. 2) As a cloud architect I am designing a new cloud where all services will be in a single broadcast domain. I see no need to use the new central loadbalancer and would like to continue to have each service manage its own VIP. 3) As a cloud architect I would like to spread my control plane across N racks for redundancy. Each rack is in its own broadcast domain. I do not want the users of the cloud to require knowledge of this topology. I want the endpoints registered in Keystone to work regardless of a rack level failure. I am using network spaces to segragate traffic in my cloud and the OpenStack loadbalancer has access to all spaces so I only require one set of loadbalancers for the deployment. 4) As a cloud architect I would like to spread my control plane across N racks for redundancy. Each rack is in its own broadcast domain. I do not want the users of the cloud to require knowledge of this topology. I want the endpoints registered in Keystone to work regardless of a rack level failure. I am using network spaces to segragate traffic in my cloud. I want the segration to extend to the load balancers and so will be requiring a set of load balancers per network space. 5) As a cloud architect I am designing a new internal cloud and have no interest in IPv6, I wish to deploy a pure IPv4 solution. 6) As a cloud architect I am designing a new cloud. I appreciate that it has been 18 years since the IETF brought us IPv6 and feel it maybe time to enable IPv6 within the cloud. I am happy to have some IPv4 where needed and am looking to deploy a dual stack IPv4 and IPv6. 7) As a cloud architect I am designing a new cloud. I appreciate that it has been 18 years since the IETF brought us IPv6 and wish to never see an IPv4 address again. I am looking to deploy a pure IPv6 cloud. 8) As a cloud architect I wish to use DNS HA in conjunction with the OpenStack loadbalancer for REASONS. 9) As a cloud administrator I would like to have the OpenStack load balancers look after HA and so will be deploying in an Active/Passive deployment. I will need to use a VIP for the loadbalancer in this configuration. 10) As a cloud architect I have an existing hardware loadbalancers I wish to use. I do not want to have to update it with the location of each API service backend. Instead I would like to have the OpenStack load balancers in an Active/Active configuration and have the hardware loadbalancers manager traffic between haproxy instance in the OpenStack loadbalancer service. I do not need to use a VIP for the loadbalancer in this configuration. My hardware loadbalancers utilise vip(s) which will need to be regestired as the endpoints for services in Keystone. 11) As a cloud administrator haproxy statistics are fascinating to me and I want the statistics from all haproxy instances to be aggregated. 12) As a cloud administrator I would like haproxy to be able to perfom health checks on the backends which assert the health of a service more conclusively than simple open port checking. 13) As a cloud administrator I which to be able to configure max connections and timeouts as my cloud evolves. 14) As a charm author of a service which is behind the OpenStack load balancer I would like the ability to tell the loadbalancer to drain connection to a specific unit and take it out of service. This will allow the unit to go into maintenance mode. 15) As a cloud architect I would like each instance of the OpenStack Loadbalancer to be in a different broadcast domain. Proposed Change =============== 1) One new interface - Both requires and provides ends of a new a interface for the backend services. The backend charm needs to inform the loadbalancer which ports the backend service is listening on and on which ports. It also needs to tell the loadbalancer which ports to listen on. .. code-block:: python {'spaces': { 'internal': { 'backend-ip': IP-I, 'backend-port': PortA, 'frontend-port': PortB}, 'admin': { 'backend-ip': IP-A, 'backend-port': PortC, 'frontend-port': PortD}, ... 'default': { 'backend-ip': IP-X, 'backend-port': PortY, 'frontend-port': PortZ}}} The loadbalancer charm now needs to check which IP or VIP (if using one) corresponds to each space name specified by the backend. It then updates the haproxy stanza to add IP-I:PortA as backend for internal traffic and adds VIP-I:PortB to listen for incoming internal traffic. It repeates this process for each 'space' specified by the backend service. The 'default' space name is used when network spaces are not in use. Having processed the request from the backend the loadbalancer now needs to tell the backend service the external IP being used to listen for connections for each space. .. code-block:: python {'spaces': { 'internal': { 'frontend-ip': VIP-I,} The backend service now updates the endpoints in the Keystone registry to point at the IPs passed back by the loadbalancer. 2) Refactor code for calculating which IP should be registered in Keystone. Currently the following competing options are used to calculate which EP should be registered in Keystone: * os-*-network set do resolve_address old method * dnsha use dnsha * os-*-hostname set use hostname * space * prefer ipv6 * use-internal-endpoints 3) One new charm - OpenStack Loadbalancer with corresponding tests & QA CI/setup. Alternatives ------------ 1) Extend existing HAProxy charm. 2) Use DNS HA. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: unknown Gerrit Topic ------------ Use Gerrit topic ""osbalancer"" for all patches related to this spec. .. code-block:: bash git-review -t osbalancer Work Items ---------- Provide OpenStack Loadbalancer Charm ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ - Write draft interface for LB <-> Backend - Write unit tests for Keystone endpoint registration code - Write Keystone endpoint registration code Mojo specification deploying and testing Mistral ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ - Write Mojo spec for deploying LB in an HA configuration Repositories ------------ A new git repository will be required for the Mistral charm: .. code-block:: bash git://git.openstack.org/openstack/charm-openstack-loadbalancer Documentation ------------- The OpenStack Loadbalancer charm should contain a README with instructions on deploying the charm. A blog post is optional but would be a useful addition. Security -------- No additional security concerns. Testing ------- Code changes will be covered by unit tests; functional testing will be done using a combination of Amulet, Bundle tester and Mojo specification.

This patch is adopting the neutron-lib hacking rules in networking-ovn.
By doing that we get rid of the N531 check which was asserting that log
messages had a translation hint and the i18n team already decided that
we should not translate logs, see [0] for more context.

The patch also fixes the H301 occurences (One import per line) and

still use eventlet in some places.

It is possible that _update_port_binding_for_instance() is called
without a migration object, such as when a user unshelves an instance.

If the instance has a port(s) with a PCI device binding, the current
logic extracts a pci mapping from old to new devices from the migration
object and migration context.  If a 'new' device is not found in the
PCI mapping, an exception is thrown.

In the case of an unshelve, there is no migration object (or migration
context), and as such we have an empty pci mapping.

This fix will only check for a new device if we have a migration object.

If you kick off a backup and the internal backup is already
running, then the manual one will fail.  Since this is what
the backup command would run anyways, we should use it
and just drive on.

The bgsave command was modified to detect the running
command and just prints out a message before

Things like ""filter results by x=y"". This results in a good deal of code being added for one-off preferences or user convenience. It also means that we continue to bump micro-versions for such additions and create more versions of the API than we probably care to document, test and maintain. What's annoying about this is that it's not even that we're adding things to the server side, we're instead just popping things off of the params in the request body based on what micro-version is specified. The biggest area of churn for this sort of thing is in the client side of things. Use Cases ========= Filters are convenient for operators doing things with large clouds. It's certainly a nice-to-have feature to be able to do things like just ask Cinder for a list of all volumes with an `error` status, or that are `bootable` or the latest, suggestion all those that are attached to host xyz. Proposed change =============== In order to add these today, we add a specific arg to the clients, and then we add specific arg parsing on the Cinder API server to interpret and parse these args. These parsed arguments are then just used to build a filter that we pass in to the sql call to get_volumes (or get_<resource>). Rather than continuing to add these for the various resources in an ad-hoc manner, this spec proposes a generalized filtered-list mechanism. Rather than add a specific filter by name over and over, instead provide a single `filter` argument that supplies Key Value pairs to be used to build the db query filter. There's likely some concern that people won't *know* what valid filter keys are, for that we can also provide a `list-filters` command that could be used in an introspective sort of way, querying the object model for the valid filter items and returning it to the caller. What's interesting about this is from the API Servers perspective we don't even really care about any of this. We can already pass in filters via the params in the request body and this just works. If you're using curl this just works already as is. If you are using the client you'd just need a way to expose it properly: (https://gist.github.com/j-griffith/f455e51d3e597af96bfe7022974b5bd9) Alternatives ------------ * We could certainly continue doing what we're doing now and just adding specific filter arguments to the clients and the API, but I don't think that's sustainable. * We could provide a generalized ""filters"" (pick a better name) controller that could be called directly and then call the specified resource item with filters. This would mean you would do things like: `cinder filters-list --resource volume` to get a list of valid filter items for a volume (volumes should be the default). `cinder filters-list --resource snapshot` for snapshots, etc. But then have something like a `cinder filtered-list --filter xyz=abc` which would go to a filtered-list controller and then call the resource controller appropriately. This might be a good way to reduce some duplicate code and churn even further but it may require just as much work and code as just having each resource have it's own ""--filter"" options to the list commands. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- Other than adding the ability to view the valid filter keys we don't even need to change anything on the Cinder server side currently. Security impact --------------- None that I'm aware of Notifications impact -------------------- Other end user impact --------------------- Life would be better Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- Life would be better Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: john-griffith Work Items ---------- * Add the filters arg to the client * Add the ability to query the API server for valid filters for a resource Dependencies ============ Testing ======= Documentation Impact ==================== We will need to update documentation to describe the new capability, although I expect anybody not using the client may already be exposing this on their own.

stopping or restarting the service has been reduced from 300
seconds to 120 seconds. This provides 2 minutes for long-lived

The callback modules have been available in neutron-lib since commit [1]
and are ready for consumption.

As the callback registry is implemented with a singleton manager
instance, sync complications can arise ensuring all consumers switch to
lib's implementation at the same time. Therefore this consumption has
been broken down:
1) Shim neutron's callbacks using lib's callback system and remove
existing neutron internals related to callbacks (devref, UTs, etc.).
2) Switch all neutron's callback imports over to neutron-lib's.
3) Have all sub-projects using callbacks move their imports over to use
neutron-lib's callbacks implementation.
4) Remove the callback shims in neutron-lib once sub-projects are moved
over to lib's callbacks.
5) Follow-on patches moving our existing uses of callbacks to the new
event payload model provided by neutron-lib.callback.events

This patch implements #1 from above, shimming neutron's callbacks and
removing devref + UTs. Rather than shimming using debtcollector, this
patch leaves callback constants as-is, and simply references the lib
class/function in its respective neutron callback module. This allows
consumers to test callback types without changing code. For example,
an except block block like that below continues to work even though
the raised exception now lives in lib::

try:
     neutron_cb_registry.notify(...)
except neutron_cb_exceptions.CallbackFailure:
     handle_exception()

In addition this patch contains minor UT updates to support the shim
approach.

The update of the apt cache and the package installation
can all be handled in a single task by providing the
package action plugin with the right parameters. This
removes an extra task to optimise execution.

The minimum Ansible version is raised to 2.2 due to a
known bug [1] in Ansible's apt module which does not
update the cache properly if the cache update and the
install are combined in a single task.

The systemd unit 'TimeoutSec' value which controls the time
between sending a SIGTERM signal and a SIGKILL signal when
stopping or restarting the service has been reduced from 300
seconds to 120 seconds. This provides 2 minutes for long-lived
sessions to drain while preventing new ones from starting
before a restart or a stop.

The 'RestartSec' value which controls the time between the
service stop and start when restarting has been reduced from
150 seconds to 2 seconds to make the restart happen faster.

These values can be adjusted by using the *_init_config_overrides
variables which use the config_template task to change template
defaults.

The systemd unit 'TimeoutSec' value which controls the time
between sending a SIGTERM signal and a SIGKILL signal when
stopping or restarting the service has been reduced from 300
seconds to 120 seconds. This provides 2 minutes for long-lived
sessions to drain while preventing new ones from starting
before a restart or a stop.

The 'RestartSec' value which controls the time between the
service stop and start when restarting has been reduced from
150 seconds to 2 seconds to make the restart happen faster.

These values can be adjusted by using the *_init_config_overrides
variables which use the config_template task to change template
defaults.

The update of the apt cache and the package installation
can all be handled in a single task by providing the
package action plugin with the right parameters. This
removes an extra task to optimise execution.

The minimum Ansible version is raised to 2.2 due to a
known bug [1] in Ansible's apt module which does not

dib is now going to have to be installed explicitly for us to actually
run the gate. the old method of just cloning the repo won't work with
dib v2.

There are other ways to accomplish this but I'm choosing this approach
knowing that it isn't ideal. First, what's the downside? This means
that dib gets installed wherever trove control plane is installed. Is
that necessary, NO. Is it the end of the world, NO.

What are the options?

- do what Octavia did and have a second requirements.txt in a folder
  called diskimage-create. Would this work, yes but we don't have such
  a mechanism right now and nothing would keep this requirements.txt
  file in sync with g-r that I know of.

- hardcode the pip install command somewhere in the devstack
  plugin. yes, this would work but this would also have no ability to
  sync with g-r.

So, while the solution proposed here isn't ideal, it strikes me as not
bad, and much less risk than the other two options.

We also need to figure out where the elements are and fix the path for
disk-image-create.

Some pep8 failures appears to have crept in as well, those are
addressed.

The CONTENT_LENGTH environ can be present, but empty, which returns
None, and causes a ValueError when attempting to use .int().

This patch removes the setting of CONTENT_LENGTH to an integer, but
instead ensures that if CONTENT_LENGTH is not empty it is an integer, to
prevent a situation where a bogus ""CONTENT_LENGTH"" header is specified.

Additionally, as the CONTENT_TYPE environ can similarly be present but
empty, we should .get() it in a similar fashion to ensure it isn't
present but None when CONTENT_LENGTH is specified.

A RingBuilder now gets a UUID when it is saved to file if
it does not already have one.

RingBuilders loaded from file do NOT get a UUID assigned unless
it was persisted in the file. This forces users to explicitly
assign an id to existing ring builders by saving the state back
to file.

The UUID is used to check that components of a composite ring
are consistent.

The UUID is included in first line of the output from:

This stops l3-agent, updates openstack-neutron and then starts the agent
again, using upgrade_batch_tasks so will happen on one node at a time.
Goal is for the floating IPs to failover to another l3 agent.

Note: there is an unresolved packaging bug in openvswitch
neutron-openvswitch-agent discussed in the bug below which will still
cause floating IP downtime (see comment #2)

The update of the apt cache and the package installation
can all be handled in a single task by providing the
package action plugin with the right parameters. This
removes an extra task to optimise execution.

The minimum Ansible version is raised to 2.2 due to a

AbsoluteLimitsTests requires force_tenant_isolation=True,
and if admin credentials are not present, the testcase will
fail instead of being skipped.

This is to let AbsoluteLimitsTests inherit from BaseVolumeAdminTest
so it can skip if admin credentials are not present.

The update of the apt cache and the package installation
can all be handled in a single task by providing the
package action plugin with the right parameters. This
removes an extra task to optimise execution.

The minimum Ansible version is raised to 2.2 due to a
known bug [1] in Ansible's apt module which does not

By registering functions directly we cut off the dependency of the
""resource extend"" functions on the plugin. This is a step towards
the goal of removing the CommonDbMixin mixin class.

Also, we register all ""resource extend"" functions at plugin create
(in __new__) instead of in the class definition (which caused the
hooks to be registered on import). This ensures the ""resource
extend"" functions are only registered for the plugins/mixins that
are actually used.

Note that decorators are used to register ""resource extend"" methods,
similar to the callback receiver decorators.

Refactor IPython extension and the tests

Mainly:

- Implements Response class instead of response dict
  (need to update the docs)

- Fix FakeConnection class from the redandunt code perspective

Need to more generarize around _call_xx in the tests...

Change-Id: Ieb46c7a696e8a4c2fe3a9cc0858ab5fef12678c6

Cleanup test_ipython code doc update and nb for test

- Abstract BaseTestIpythonExtension class for testing tools
-- And then, parse the child test classes for the methods to assert
- Remove unnecessary args and mock patches
- Avoid redandunt code duplication

Update the docs with the Response

Adding a notebook for testing the ipython extension
plus automated testing of that notebook

This patch adds '/os-keypairs' related routes by a plain list, instead
of using stevedore. After all the Nova API endpoints moves to
the plain routes list, the usage of stevedore for API loading will be
removed from Nova.

Also note that the original 'ProjectMapper' use the 'routes.Mapper.resource'

1. What is the problem?
As discussed in the spec[1], we lack support of one deployment
scenario that each OpenStack cloud provides external network
for north-south traffic and at the same time east-west networking
of tenant networks between OpenStack clouds are also enabled.

2. What is the solution to the problem?
Implement a new layer-3 networking model discussed in the spec[1].

3. What features need to be implemented to the Tricircle
to realize the solution?
Xmanager is modified to properly configure router interface, router
extra routes and subnet host routes for the new model.

specified in that file.

It is also possible to specify --kolla-config-file multiple times to
control the behaviour of kolla-build.

Nova offers a ""serial console"" as an alternative to graphical consoles
like VNC/SPICE/RDP. This is useful for platforms which don't have
graphical consoles, for example the ""IBM system z"" platform.

This change introduces a test which ensures that the interaction with
the serial console is possible before and after a live-migration.
As the unified remote console API is available since microversion 2.6,
I use this as a base for the tests. This made id necessary to update
the schemas.

This change introduces a config option to enable new test cases for
the serial console.
A Nova change (see I7af395a867e0657c26fa064d2b0134345cd96814),
which uses the hook for live-migration testing, will use the config
option of this change to alter the testing system on the fly to
enable the testing of the serial console.

This change implements a MOTD message and provides a hash of
sshd config options which are sourced to the puppet-ssh module
as a hash.

The SSHD puppet service is enabled by default, as it is

Python Argparse supports the 'append' action [1] which is super handy to allow
a user to repeat several times the same argument, each time with different
values.

This doesn't work with occ that tries to ""fix argv"" but raises this error:

os_client_config.exceptions.OpenStackConfigException: The following options
were given: '--foo,--foo' which contain duplicates except that one has _

This patch tweak the _fix_argv() function so that it doesn't explode
if the duplicate option has no '_' not '-' in its name.

When the percona-cluster charm sets an access-network but the default
unit-get address is not on that network extra shared-db relations get
executed. This is specifically a problem when running upgrades and
trying to avoid API downtime.

The root cause is that the access-network is not checked until the
SharedDBContext is consulted. But then db_joined function will
change it back to the wrong ip on subsequent runs.

This change adds a check for access-network on the relation during the
db_joined function and pushes IP selection off to get_relation_ip.

Charm helpers sync to pull in changes to get_relation_ip.

Currently os-net_config will map nics from a user-supplied mapping file
only if the nic is active (operstate = up).  This can cause problems
if a nic is in a bond and one of the bond's nics has no carrier.
This fix will map the nic from the mapping file if the nic is defined

The fix implements a new function to return a list of available nics
(no check of operstate) for use if a mapping file is supplied.  The
list of active nics must still be used in the default case when
numbering nics (no mapping file supplied).  There is also some

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================ Placement API claiming resources ================================ https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/placement-claims Have intermediate locking of resources so the Placement API could return more accurate ResourceProviders on a query for a specific set of resource amounts. Problem description =================== The scheduler currently calls the Placement API in order to get a list of ResourceProviders that match a specific request made of amounts of resource classes. How the Placement API corresponding resource calculates that is made by getting the list of inventories for each resource class with their total amounts and decreasing each of those values by the amounts corresponding of the allocations that are done by the ResourceTracker when creating an instance. While this model fits very well for a non-resource-constrainted cloud, we know that this can be suboptimal because of requests concurrency. Somehow, we would like to make sure that what the Placement API returns is based on not only what is existing, but also what is currently *subject to exist*. To his merit, Mr. Jay Pipes carries the idea to have the Placement API being able to give a ticket back to the conductor (as an expression of a placement request) so later in the boot process, the compute can acknowledge that ticket. Use Cases --------- As an operator, I'd like to avoid too many reschedules if my cloud becomes full because it could lead to a snowball effect. Proposed change =============== We propose to augment the Placement API by adding a new REST resource called ""claim"" that would be triggered at the end of the scheduler decision-making process and which would create Allocation records for the parameterized ResourceProvider ID, with the slight difference that those allocation records would have a NULL UUID for the consumer_id field. That POST would return a Claim ID that would be the record ID of a row in a new mapping table that links to the corresponding allocation entries that were created. That claim ID that the scheduler would get on that POST /claims query would be passed over the wire eventually down to the compute so that the latter would PUT or DELETE (pick your preference) /claims so it would trigger updating the corresponding allocation entries with the right consumer_id values. Alternatives ------------ We could consider that Placement doesn't need to know the on-going resource creations and that it is only a capacity issue. Data model impact ----------------- To be refined A LOT with the help of you. A lookup table. CREATE TABLE claims ( id INT NOT NULL, uuid INT NOT NULL, consumer_id INT NOT NULL, allocation_id INT NOT NULL, timestamp INT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id), FOREIGN KEY fk_allocations (allocation_id) REFERENCES allocations (id), UNIQUE INDEX (consumer_id), ); REST API impact --------------- Two interfaces : * POST /claims for creating a claim (when the scheduler asks for resources) * PUT /claims for expressing the use of that claim (when the compute creates the instance) `POST /claims` ************************** Create one new claim. An example POST request:: Content-type: application/json { ""resource_provider"": { ""uuid"": ""7dd1cd8a-4058-4f58-a24a-e38a5f4d563e"" }, ""resources"": { ""VCPU"": 2, ""MEMORY_MB"": 1024 } } The body of the request must match the following JSONSchema document:: { ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""resource_provider"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""uuid"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""format"": ""uuid"" } }, ""additionalProperties"": false, ""required"": [""uuid""] }, ""resources"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""patternProperties"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""patternProperties"": { ""^[A-Z_]+$"": {""type"": ""integer""} } }, ""additionalProperties"": false }, ""required"": [ ""resource_provider"", ""resources"" ] ""additionalProperties"": False } The response body is empty. The headers include a location header pointing to the created claim:: 201 Created Location: /claims/eaaf1c04-ced2-40e4-89a2-87edded06d64 `PUT /claims` ************************** Updates one claim. An example PUT request:: Content-type: application/json { ""claim"": { ""uuid"": ""7dd1cd8a-4058-4f58-a24a-e38a5f4d563e"" ""consumer_id"": ""eaaf1c04-ced2-40e4-89a2-87edded06d64"" } } The body of the request must match the following JSONSchema document:: { ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""claim"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""uuid"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""format"": ""uuid"" }, ""consumer_id"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""format"": ""uuid"" } }, ""additionalProperties"": false, ""required"": [""uuid"", ""consumer_id""] }, }, ""required"": [""claim""] ""additionalProperties"": False } The returned HTTP response code will be one of the following: * `200 OK` if the claim record is successfully updated * `400 Bad Request` for bad or invalid syntax Security impact --------------- None.

Many attribute in the request schema are defined with
allowed enum values. But schema does not specify those
enum as string type.

enum in json schema is defined in such a way that it
allows any type not just string so defining each enum type
as string explicitly makes schema more readable and consistent
with other API schema.

Note- this does not change any behavior or does not fix any issue.
This is just for consistency with other schema definition and readability.

The veth_pair name was partially configurable, however eth0's
veth pair naming scheme was hard coded.

This change accomplishes:
- veth pair prefix templating is now consistent across all interfaces
  generated by the role.
- no change is made to the default configuration of veth pair naming,
  it only allows more reusability of the role by allowing the veth
  pair naming to be configured by the role's consumers.
- eth0 veth pair naming scheme can be configured just as other
  interfaces could be before.

This patch rehomes the extra_dhcp_opt extension
from neutron.extensions into the API definitions
within neutron-lib. As part of the rehome some
refactoring is done:
- The DHCP opt exceptions are removed; one is never used [1]
and the other extends InvalidInput and is only used in the
validator [2] and can be replaced by a vanilla InvalidInput
exception.
- The validator is refactored and moved into validators.
- The 'id' EXTRA_DHCP_OPT_KEY_SPECS is removed as its
unused.
- The validator in lib is registered as type
'type:list_of_extra_dhcp_options' which is slightly
different than the original type. This is intentional to
ensure the rehome/consume goes smoothly and the
same validator is not registered multiple times.

UTs + release note also included.

In addition a bugfix is included that's required for the validator
herein. The problem is that if data is passed into
_validate_list_of_items that is a list of dicts, a TypeError is
raised because dicts are unhashable.

This api-def is used in stadium sub-projects such as
networking-ovn and is therefore a candidate for
rehoming.

By default the Tempest and alternate Tempest users and tenants are not deleted and the admin user specified in ``tempest.conf`` is never deleted. It is recommended that the first run of ``tempest cleanup`` should be with the **--init-saved-state** option. Doing so will initialize the saved state of the OpenStack deployment such that when the clean up command is given it will only delete objects that do not need to be kept. Alternatively, you can create a ``saved_state.json`` file manually that will specify the objects that ``tempest cleanup`` shall not delete. For an example of the format of this file, run the command with the **--init-saved-state** flag and look at the generated ``./saved_state.json`` file. **--init-saved-state**: Typically used on an initial run of the command, it will initialize the saved state of the OpenStack deployment and output a ``saved_state.json`` file containing objects from your deployment that will be preserved from the clean up command. This should be done prior to running tempest tests. **--delete-tempest-conf-objects**: If set to ``true``, then the command will delete the Tempest and alternate Tempest tenants in addition to the objects associated with them on clean up. If set to ``false``, the command will delete the objects associated with the Tempest and alternate Tempest tenants but will not delete the tenants themselves. Default value is ``false``. **--dry-run**: Creates a report (``./dry_run.json``) of the tenants that will be cleaned up (in the ``_tenants_to_clean`` dictionary [1]_) and the global objects that will be removed (domains, flavors, images, roles, tenants, and users). Once cleanup is executed (e.g. run without parameters), running it again with **--dry-run** should yield an empty report. **--help**: Print the help text for the command and parameters. .. [1] The ``_tenants_to_clean`` dictionary in ``dry_run.json`` lists the tenants that ``tempest cleanup`` will loop through to delete child objects, but the command will, by default, not delete the tenants themselves. This may differ from the ``tenants`` list as you can clean the Tempest and alternate Tempest tenants but they will not be deleted unless the **--delete-tempest-conf-objects** flag is used to force their deletion. ","**--init-saved-state**: Before you can execute cleanup you must initialize the saved state by running it with the **--init-saved-state** flag (creating ./saved_state.json), which protects your deployment from cleanup deleting objects you want to keep. Typically you would run cleanup with **--init-saved-state** prior to a tempest run. If this is not the case saved_state.json must be edited, removing objects you want cleanup to delete. **--dry-run**: Creates a report (dry_run.json) of the tenants that will be cleaned up (in the ""_tenants_to_clean"" array), and the global objects that will be removed (tenants, users, flavors and images). Once cleanup is executed in normal mode, running it again with **--dry-run** should yield an empty report. **NOTE**: The _tenants_to_clean array in dry-run.json lists the tenants that cleanup will loop through and delete child objects, not delete the tenant itself. This may differ from the tenants array as you can clean the tempest and alternate tempest tenants but by default, cleanup deletes the objects in the tempest and alternate tempest tenants but does not delete those tenants unless the **--delete-tempest-conf-objects** flag is used to force their deletion. **Normal mode**: running with no arguments, will query your deployment and build a list of objects to delete after filtering out the objects found in saved_state.json and based on the **--delete-tempest-conf-objects** flag. By default the tempest and alternate tempest users and tenants are not deleted and the admin user specified in tempest.conf is never deleted.

This reuses the existing password generation mistral action to generate an ssh

Paramiko is used to generate the ssh key, based on the existing approach in the
nova keypair api.

Also update validation ssh key generation to reuse the same method.

The description of scope parameter in the API docs is inconsistent for
scoped and explicit unscoped authorization. It doesn't explain clearly
when the parameter should be set to keyword 'unscoped' (explicit
unscoped authorization) and when to include ID/name of the project/
domain (scoped authorization). This patch covers the required update
for the scope parameter by introducing separate descriptions for the
above mentioned cases.

For explicit unscoped authorization, the keystone server specifies
scope value as 'unscoped' whereas in some old versions of keystoneauth
the value is {'unscoped': {}}. Added a comment to keystone/auth/schema.py
to make sure the type of scope parameter is object and not string, so
that it is consistent with older versions too.

In v3 API docs the case for token authentication with explicit unscoped
authorization is missing. Added documentation and request example for
that case.

led to situation when federated user without groups could scope a token

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================ Show persisted scheduler hints in server details ================================================ https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/show-scheduler-hints-in-server-details Create a new field in the API response for GET /servers/{server-id} which contains the persisted scheduler hints. Problem description =================== Nova persists the scheduler hints provided at instance boot. Nova uses the persistent hints later when the instance is migrated or evacuated. However there is no way to get the hints of an already booted instance through the Nova REST API. Use Cases --------- I as a server owner want to know about the scheduler hints my server was booted with so that I know what hint nova will use when I migrate my server. Proposed change =============== Modify the API response for ``GET /servers/{server-id}`` to contain information about the scheduler hints. Create a new entry in the API response, named ""scheduler_hints"". Its value will be an object, the persisted scheduler hints. Scheduler hints are persisted here [1]. Also the python-novaclient will be adapted to the new API. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- In the response for URL: ``GET /servers/{server-id}``: * The current response will be extended in a new microversion with a new entry called ""scheduler_hints"", which will contain the persisted scheduler hints. * URL: * /v2.1/servers/{server_id} * Request Method: * GET * Proposed JSON response:: { ""server"": { ""scheduler_hints"": { ""group"": ""2eeb70fe-0e2b-48ab-bdb0-67f83a090188"", ""same_host"": ""45a4ae81-b117-4f08-883b-bb6990774203"" }, <other stuff> } } Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- A new data entry will be added in the output of the command ``nova show <server>`` in python-novaclient [2]. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Gábor Antal (gabor.antal) Work Items ---------- * Add ""scheduler_hints"" field to the server details response in a new microversion, and fill it with the persisted scheduler hints * Extend existing functional tests * Update the API documentation * Update python-novaclient and its tests Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= We need to adjust the currently existing functional tests.

All counter based graphs inside the the Swift dashboard are fixed
and now correctly showing the timings per second rather than total
values per telegraf flush interval.
Additionally the High Response Time graphs are now using the timing_upper
metrics.

Minor issues inside the playbook-influx-telegraf.yml and telegraf.conf.j2
are fixed to support deployments without optional componentns like ironic,
cinder etc.

This hiera key is used by keystone to create the ceilometer service
user. It works in CI cause keystone and the ceilometer services are in
the same node. However, this fails if keystone is deployed on a separate
note.

We should only deploy it in the nodes containing the keystone service
since it's only relevant to create the service user.

Once a new neutron-lib release will be cut off, the new hacking check
will break the pep8 target because the code still uses translation
markers for log messages.

Instead of fixing all remaining log messages and hoping no new messages
land before neutron-lib release, we temporarily disable the check; we
will reenable it back once we have a neutron-lib release in gate that we
can validate the patch removing translation markers against.

If live migrate operation failed, there would be a message like:
'Failed to live migrate instance to host ""host01"".'
But, if we choose none target host, the message will be:
'Failed to live migrate instance to host """".'
The empty quote marks looks strange.

I think it would be better to check whether data['host'] is
None/empty at first and use a message without hostname if it is.

This change adds an `include` statement to bring in the extra
functionality available from the existing puppet-ssh module in
already available in RDO.

By using puppet-ssh it provides a framework to allow the passing in of
server options using just hiera values under ssh::server_options.
For example, sshd_config banner can now be passed a server option, as
well as all the new parameters outlined in the launchpad issue that
the patch references for Closing. For this reason, the former augeas
setting for `Banner /etc/issue` is now managed by the main puppet-ssh
module instead.

The change also allows population of MOTD text to `/etc/motd` as
well as `issue.net`.

$bannertext is refactored in accordance with patch [1]

The Horizon spinner was using a spinner generated and animated
entirely out of JavaScript. Since CSS3 provides animates and we have
access to icon fonts, doing everything with JavaScript is not
necessary and actually taxing on the browser. Plus, all of the
spinner options were being passed in and around with JavaScript,
including the colors.  This makes it supremely difficult to use the
theme to style the spinner.

The new spinner is just defined by a handful of templates now. There
are two clientside templates to support Legacy Horizon, and one
template in the Angular to support spinners going forward.  Legacy
Horizon had two forms of spinners, so it was broken up. Angular as
not yet made use of the inline spinner, but should follow the same
markup when it is made.

There are two types of spinners, inline spinners (those shown when a
dynamic tab content is loading) and modal spinners (various other
places).  These are consistent with each other for the 'default'
experience, but their experience can be entirely customized separate
from each other.  'material' has been augmented with loaders defined
within their design spec to show the power of this new feature.

horizon.templates.js was augmented with this refactor to support only
having to compile one tempalte at a time (instead of all of them) and
caching that template so that all of them can be recompiled later.
Also, horizon.loader.js was added to house template compilation code
that was repeated in several locations.

To test overwriting page modal spinner and inline-modal spinner
examples, please follow the instructions in _loading_inline_exmaple.html,
_loading_modal_example.html under

When using multiple CSVs, we rely on the instance itself when
locating its files.

The issue is that we're fetching the instance files location after
destroying the instance, for which reason we're leaking instance
files.

The update of the apt cache and the package installation
can all be handled in a single task by providing the
package action plugin with the right parameters. This
removes an extra task to optimise execution.

The minimum Ansible version is raised to 2.2 due to a
known bug [1] in Ansible's apt module which does not
update the cache properly if the cache update and the
install are combined in a single task.

After doing nova backup, the snapshots that generated
in the backup process are still exist and will never
be deleted, this will waste a lot of storage space.
This patch add the deletion of the temporary snapshots
to save backup space.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================== Network configuration ===================== Network configuration for the TripleO GUI Problem Description =================== The TripleO GUI allows the Deployer to specify many different network configuration options. Many of these options aren't mutually exclusive which can create complex configurations. As such, it's not trivial to verify that the desired configuration has been achieved by using the existing interface. Proposed Change =============== Overview -------- I propose that we create a new network configuration manager in the TripleO GUI. This will allos the Deployer to quickly select any relevant settings for their deployment in contained way. Furthermore, I propose that we create a network summary for the deployment which will present the network topology in a visual manner. This will enable the Deployer to validate their work at a glance. Alternatives ------------ Security Impact --------------- * This change involves parsing user-uploaded data. * Heat template parsing, and template-environment resolution requires a non-trivial amount of time Other End User Impact --------------------- Performance Impact ------------------ Other Deployer Impact --------------------- Developer Impact ---------------- Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: hpokorny Work Items ---------- * Create the networking tab - Create network traffic section - Configuration by role - Network details configuration * Create the network topology diagram Initially, we will support the following network configurations: * Single nic with vlans * Bond with vlans (ovs bonds only at first) * Multiple nics * Ability to configure any of the networks: ctlplane, external, internal_api, storage, storage_mgmt, tenant, management Dependencies ============ Testing ======= Documentation Impact ==================== References ========== * Wireframes https://openstack.invisionapp.com/share/UM87J4NBQ#/screens/179046668/comments ",,93,0

This was originally added in change
I60abcd4f27dc877c4e420071be77c9fdb697ad99 because we still
created the BDMs in the API, and we did it based on the
build_request.block_device_mapping set in the _provision_instances
method.

We had to workaround the fact that BuildRequest.create()
would serialize the BDMs to store them in the DB, and then
deserialize them to set them on the BuildRequest object field.
As a result, the BuildRequest.block_device_mapping field was
orphaned (it lost it's internal RequestContext). So later on
when creating the BDMs from BuildRequest.block_device_mapping,
the update_or_create() remotable call would fail since the
object didn't have a context set. To workaround that we made a
clone of the BlockDeviceMappingList when creating the BuildRequest
and then set the original ""dirty"" list on the BuildRequest object
which was used later to create the BDMs.

In change I8742071b55f018f864f5a382de20075a5b444a79 we stopped
creating the BDMs in the API service and started created them
in the conductor service when calling schedule_and_build_instances.
And the block_device_mapping list passed to that conductor
method is the same one that we hacked into the BuildRequest object
in the earlier change (for the same reason really).

So at this point, we no longer need this confusing workaround and
can remove it.

Preserve default behavior, which is extract
those from the overcloud image.

The example use case is when running oooq from
a priv container. Like running in Centos container
on the Ubuntu virthost. The virt-copy-out may be
working fine on the host OS and failing within the

""'/dev/urandom' is not a supported random source"".
So those images may be prepared as well at the host
