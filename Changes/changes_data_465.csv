The unit test uses sqlite for test which closes db foreign keys
function by default. This patch enabled the sqlite foreign keys
function for unit test by default.

The ""project"" table is a self referencing FK table(id <-> domain_id
column). So when the FK is enabled, there must exists a root record
before insert data to this table. It's <<keystone.domain.root>>.

Usually, the <<keystone.domain.root>> recored is inserted into the
table once operators run ""keystone-manage db_sync"" command when
deploy Keystone. But the unit test code doesn't run this command,
it initialise the db schema by reading sqlalchemy object model, so
the <<keystone.domain.root>> record is missed. Then we can't create
any project record, it'll raise FK error.

So in this patch, before creating any projects in the test, we must
ensure the <<keystone.domain.root>> record exists first.

Since we remove a resource's definition after it is deleted, we must also
update a resource's definition after it is updated. Otherwise, a resource
that depended on the now-deleted resource prior to its last in-place update
could remain in the template, leaving the stack inoperable since it is
unable to calculate its own dependencies.

We already update the template in the backup stack when updating resources
in-place, and in the main stack when creating replacement resources. Also
update the main template when resources are updated in-place, not just when
they are replaced.

Currently there is a race where ceph-nfs is free to be started before
the colocation constraint with the VIP is created. This issue is
exacerbated by the fact that the container being started (via a systemd
unit file managed by pacemaker) never fails in case the daemon
encounters an error, because it has inside it:
/usr/bin/ganesha.nfsd ""${GANESHA_OPTIONS[@]}"" -L /var/log/ganesha/ganesha.log ""${GANESHA_EPOCH}"" || return 0

Since the container never fails, docker never exits and so systemd and
pacemaker think everything is fine and it won't get rescheduled on
another node.

We can avoid this issue completely if we can guarantee that
we start the VIP and the ceph-nfs service on the bootstrap node only
(by tagging only that node with the right property) and only later we
add the node property on all the other nodes.

The drawback of this approach is that, barring any failures, ceph-nfs
will always be started on the master node for that service.

Introduce an openshift_node template that serves as base for all
openshift services. This reworks the inventory files so that hosts are
defined once and made part of the appropriate groups.

The master node can now be split from the infra node, or bundled
together with the Worker in the all-in-one role.

Provide environment files to enable the Master, Worker, Infra or
all-in-one role individually.

Currently, we have no test to check if we actually deploy OpenShift
at the end of the scenario009 job. This can easily lead to false
positives from this job if some deploy step fails silently.

This patch adds two very basic commands to check if the OpenShift
cluster is actually operational.

If the iSCSI connection to a device goes down right after we flush it,
or if one of the paths of a multipath device goes down right before we
start disconnecting, the detach will fail even though it should succeed.

We'll see a VolumePathNotRemoved exception listing volumes that had not
disappeared.

This happens because, under those circumstances, it may take up to 30
seconds for the SCSI device to be removed from /dev, but expect it to
disappear in 6 seconds (first check happens, immediately, then another
in 2 seconds, and another in 4 seconds).

Since the device will be removed if we wait a bit more, this patch makes
it so that we wait for up to 30 seconds for the removal.

To ensure we wait as little time as possible, we change the way we wait
for the devices to be removed.  Instead of checking, sleeping for 2 and
then for 4 seconds, and then checking again, we just sleep 500ms between
checks, and we do the DEBUG log every 5 seconds.

interop provided the interop-tempest-consistency job[1]
which will check the consistency between Tempest tests and
those used in interop guidelines.

If Tempest will change/remove any tests which are being used
in interop guidelines, this job should be able to detect that.

Till now we used to check such consistency by manual review
which obviously cannot be perfect always.

As first, I am adding it as n-v job and soon we should make it

This patch set changes logic in test_get_config_file which
is currently referencing environment variables for test
execution, but this leads to non-deterministic behavior.
Tests are failing sometimes (e.g. [0]) because of cross-pollination
between tests, meaning that one test can change the value of
os.environ['TEMPEST_CONFIG_DIR'] (for example) causing this
test to fail. To make the test always pass, the same
values are always returned via mocking.

This assumes that tempest/etc exists which is a valid
assumption since it should always be in the repo [1].

Keystone relies on oslo.messaging to handle the underlying routing
of messaging for keystone notifications and CADF events. Early
testing implementations for notification support in keystone mocked
and internal method of the oslo.messaging implementation to make sure
it was actually being invoked. This falls outside of the realm of
keystone testing because it's testing the internal implementation
details of an external library (which is already tested anyway).

This commit adjusts the tests to mock a public facing method instead
of a private one. This makes the mock safer since it's consuming a
public API just like the rest of the notification framework.

This patchset changes the existing health policy to allow
NODE_STATUS_POLLING to be combined with NODE_STATUS_POLL_URL to provide
multiple detection types.

The existing implementation of NODE_STATUS_POLLING was changed to
directly perform a do_check on the node instead of doing a cluster check
operation. This was done to avoid locking the cluster as part of the
health check. When the cluster check was performed during a health
check, there was a potential lock contention problem if the user was
already performing other operations on the same cluster.

This change increases the default timeout to 180 secs for any operation.
Also removed the hard-coded timeout for lifecycle hook test to use the

When running a performance and scale testing scenario to create
100 networks, subnets and one VM per subnet, we observe that the function
get_pending_or_processing_ops is called 5636 times (total time of 0.426 seconds
and cumulative time of 135 seconds) and get_oldest_pending_db_row_with_lock
is called 8450 times (total time 1.747 seconds and cumulative time 685 seconds).
This patch implements baked queries to reduce time spent in these functions.
The ""baked"" query system in SQLAlchemy caches the string
SQL statement for a particular Query-construction path.   As
some profiling in Neutron have observed 30-40% time spent in
constructing Query objects due to the many small ""fetch-one-object""
style of query, the ""baked"" system may potentially be able to
greatly reduce this in neutron and its drivers. Networkind-odl is
traditionally known to slow down things due to journaling and this
patch aims to improve that situation. Baked Query Docs:
http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/extensions/baked.html

Profiling networking-odl, we see that the with baked queries
time spent in get_pending_or_processing_ops reduced by 40.7%
and time spent in get_oldest_pending_db_row_with_lock reduced by 60.6%.

As part of the migration to Zuul v3 jobs should be converted to native
versions. This patch uses `devstack`'s native job to provide a base
for the functional and fullstack tests.

When backporting this commit a merge conflict ocurred. This was due to a
patch that imported zuul job settings from project-config [1] that was
done directly on the branch.

Have the caller set up any of their options before passing a
ConfigOpts instance to main() and then let main() take over processing
from there.

Change the check callback argument to take an UpgradeCommands instance
so in the future if there are more commands we can get the callbacks
out of it ourself.

Add a default_config_files option to main() so that applications can
pass locations oslo.config won't find by default.

Change 'category' to 'command'.

Use a closure in _register_cli_options instead of a separate function
that requires a partial.

As discussed on the IRC meeting [1], these tests have no value and are
100% failing all the time now.
Additionally in the stadium requirements [2] there's no requirement to
have these tests.

It makes no sense to keep them as such.

Additionally, networking_odl/tests/contrib directory is removed.
At first glance it contained mentions of fullstack which needed updated,
but upon further research it was found that the files in it weren't used
so it's removed altogether.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

Nspawn containers can attach directly to the physical host interface
using macvlan which allows us to greatly simplify connectivity in test
instances.

Changes to the user variable files have been made to allow the services
to function on a simplified stack.

If hypervisor_properties or resource_properties are set to empty strings
by the API client, they are persisted as empty strings in the database.
However, in convert_requirements(), the code assumes they are JSON
strings and tries to parse them, which raises a MalformedRequirements
exception.

This can be triggered by an operator when updating an extra capability
on a node that is reserved with resource_properties set to an empty
string, as is_updatable_extra_capability() calls convert_requirements().
Blazar would return a 400 Client Error to them.

Ideally, only valid JSON should be persisted to the database. However,
this will require an Alembic migration to change existing empty strings
to empty JSON arrays. In the meantime, this simpler patch can be
backported to stable branches.

There appears to be no need for the openstack packages
to be installed by this role, especially given that
they conflict with the installs done by the utility
playbook when doing a source-based install.

Also, the other packages in the list appear to be a
remnant of the past. It appears that neither 'which'
or 'rsync' are used in the role through shell commands

Sahara supports unversioned endpoint also for the stable API v1.1,
and this is a requirement in order to use the experimental API v2.
See https://review.openstack.org/#/c/582285/ for more details.

Following the pattern used for other services with unversioned
endpoints, the sahara_service_*uri variables are directly and all
sahara_service_*url can thus be removed.

Dnsmasq and haproxy are used frequently by neutron and nova, apparmor
profiles can block some operations and the deployed cloud can't
work properly so some tests are going to fail.

Some openSUSE distros has apparmor enabled by default so we need to
disable it.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

The repo container's package cache causes quite a bit of confusion
given that it's a 'hidden' feature which catches deployers off-guard
when they already have their own cache configured. This is really
the kind of service which people should manage outside of OSA. It
also makes no sense if the deployer is using their own local mirror
which is a fairly common practise. Adding to that, it seems that it
is broken in bionic, causing massive delays in package installs.
Finally, it also adds to quite a bit of complexity due to the fact
that it's in a container - so in the playbooks prior to the container's
existence we have to detect whether it's there and add/remove the config
accordingly.

Let's just remove it and let deployers managing their own caching
infrastructure if they want it.

Starting with the Stein series, the ironic virt driver no longer exposes
the standard VCPU/MEMORY/DISK resource classes. If for any reason the
inventory for them is created on the Rocky side of grenade, the verification
phase fails after upgrading to Stein. This breaks ironic-inspector CI.

This patch updates the logic to check for a custom resource class.

The change adds an option to the charm to use JUJU_AVAILABILITY_ZONE
environment variable set by Juju for the hook environment based on the
underlying provider's availability zone information for a given machine.

This information is used to configure the availability_zone setting for
Neutron DHCP and L3 agents specifically because they support it
and for other agents (because both neutron.conf and agent-specific
configuration files are loaded) such as metadata agents and lbaas
agents.

Additionally, a setting is added to allow changing the default
availability zone because 'nova' is a default value coming from the
Neutron defaults for agents.

Report back and update the actual volume size that is created in ScaleIO.

ScaleIO volumes support sizes that are multiplies of 8 GB.
This change updates the db with the real volume size.
However, it is a partial fix, because the quota is not updated.

The boolean property sio_round_volume_capacity specifies whether the
user allows ScaleIO to create volumes with a size that is
not a multiply of 8GB, hence causing ScaleIO to round it up.
When set to False, creation of volumes with a size that is different
than 8GB will fail.

The repo container's package cache causes quite a bit of confusion
given that it's a 'hidden' feature which catches deployers off-guard
when they already have their own cache configured. This is really
the kind of service which people should manage outside of OSA. It
also makes no sense if the deployer is using their own local mirror
which is a fairly common practise. Adding to that, it seems that it
is broken in bionic, causing massive delays in package installs.
Finally, it also adds to quite a bit of complexity due to the fact
that it's in a container - so in the playbooks prior to the container's
existence we have to detect whether it's there and add/remove the config
accordingly.

Let's just remove it and let deployers managing their own caching
infrastructure if they want it.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

Normally this is not needed but for some reason daemon-reload
isn't called after fuel-rabbit-fence is installed.

Fixing it in library is a 'quick hack', normal fix should
be done on packaging level.

New releases of CentOS 7.* are being shipped from time to time, current version is CentOS-7.2. Once new release is shipped it becomes the only supported release of CentOS, packages with updates and bug fixes are distributed only through repositories of latest release (as of this writing - CentOS 7.2). This is called rolling update. This means that packages on master node are becoming obsolete and can't be updated unless we update master node to next current release (do not mix up with CR repository, it's a different thing). This is not good because gradually there are vulnerabilities found which there are no fixes for in CentOS 7.1 (in case of MOS-8) repositories. To address this issue an upgrade workflow should be developed that will allow to align master node with upstream packages. -------------------- Problem description -------------------- Existing repository structure on master node looks like shown below: :: +-----------------------------------------+ | mirror.fuel-infra.org | | | +---------+ | +-----------------+ +----------------+ | | MOS ISO | | | mos8.0-security | | mos8.0-updates | | +----+----+ | +--------+--------+ +--------+-------+ | | | | | | | +-----------------------------------------+ | | | | | | +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | | | | | +----+----+ +---------------+ +--------+--------+ +--------+-------+ | | | Nailgun | | 8.0_auxiliary | | mos8.0-security | | mos8.0-updates | | | +----+----+ +-------+-------+ +--------+--------+ +--------+-------+ | | | | | | | | +---------------+---------+---------+--------------------+ | | | | | | | | +--------------+----+-----+------------------------------+ | | | | | | | | +----+-----------+ | | +--------+-------+ | | | Docker +--+-+ | | Local | | | | containers | +--+-+ | system | | | +----------------+ | | +----------------+ | | +----------------+ | | | +----------------+ | | | | Master node | +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+ The following repositories are available on master node: * 8.0_auxiliary * type - local * location - file:///var/www/nailgun/2015.1.0-7.0/centos/auxiliary/ * mos8.0-security * type - mirror * location - http://mirror.fuel-infra.org/mos-repos/centos/mos8.0-centos7-fuel/security/x86_64/ * mos8.0-updates * type - mirror * location - http://mirror.fuel-infra.org/mos-repos/centos/mos8.0-centos7-fuel/updates/x86_64/ * nailgun * type - local * location - file:/var/www/nailgun/2015.1.0-7.0/centos/x86_64 The problem with this setup is that the only way to update a package is to put it into one of mos8.0-* repositories. 'nailgun' repository is local only, and there is no source for '8.0_auxiliary'. Using 'mos8.0-security' or 'mos8.0-updates' is OK if a package being updated was re-built by Mirantis. If it is not and we need to update a package that was taken from upstream then the following ways are possible: * get required packages only and create micro-repository that will be available to customer * re-build packages that should be updated and put them into our repositories Both ways are bad since they require significant amount of work from the teams involved. A better solution is to provide access to upstream packages so that customer could install latest packages without any significant help from our side. ---------------- Proposed changes ---------------- Proposed repository structure is shown below. :: +---------------------------------------------------------+ | mirror.fuel-infra.org | | +------------+ | +---------+ | +-----------------+ +----------------+ | MOS CentOS | | | MOS ISO | | | mos8.0-security | | mos8.0-updates | | Snapshot | | +----+----+ | +--------+--------+ +--------+-------+ +-----+------+ | | | | | | | | +---------------------------------------------------------+ | | | | | | | | +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | | | | | | | +----+----+ +---------------+ +--------+--------+ +--------+-------+ | | | | Nailgun | | 8.0_auxiliary | | mos8.0-security | | mos8.0-updates | | | | +----+----+ +-------+-------+ +--------+--------+ +--------+-------+ | | | | | | | | | | | +-------------------+--------------------+ | | | | | | | | | +-----------+ +-------------+ | | | | +--+ whitelist +---+ mos8.0-base | | +----------------+ | | | | +-----------+ +-----------+-+ | +------+ base +--------+ | | | | | +----------------+ | | | +--------------------------+ | | | +----------------+ | | | | | | | +------+ extras +--------+ | +--------------+----+ | | | | +----------------+ | | | | | | | | | | +----------------+ | | | +----+-----------+ | | | | | +------+ updates +--------+ | | Docker +--+-+ | | | | | +----------------+ | | | containers | +--+-+ +-+---+----+----+--+ | | +----------------+ | | | Local | | | +----------------+ | | system | | | +----------------+ +------------------+ | | | | Master node | +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+ The goal is to add three additional repositories to receive updated packages from upstream: * base - CentOS-7 base repository * extras - CentOS-7 extras repository * updates - CentOS-7 updates repository These repositories shouldn't be directly connected to CentOS upstream mirrors because we want to verify that upgrading master node with upstream packages works before our customers face any issues with that. Because of that we will use snapshots of upstream repositories made by Mirantis and published after some verification tests that can guarantee that upgrade is successfull. We create, test and publish all packages from upstream mirrors, so it’s a kind of ‘delayed updates’ rather then 'selected updates'. The process of creating, testing and publishing should be the following: * CI starts creating upstream CentOS snapshots. Those snapshot names must include full CentOS release number (e.g. 7.1 instead of just 7) because there might be more than one CentOS snapshot created at the same time (e.g. for CentOS-6 and CentOS-7). * Periodic job runs verification tests against latest (at the moment of test run) snapshot. Periodic job should run once per several days, however this is a topic to discuss. If the job fails then there are two possible ways: * Run verification job against previous snapshot (and so on if that one fails too). * Wait for the next scheduled run. * If there are packages that fix critical security issues then verification job should be triggered immediately. If the job fails then it should be investigated and fixed. As soon as verification test passes we publish corresponding snapshot to our mirror *and* issue release notes to notify customer that they have to upgrade master node. * When periodic verification test passes we publish corresponding snapshot to our mirror. Then we either send a notification to customers that new packages are available, or do nothing. But using only snapshots is not enough. Second part of the problem is local 'nailgun' repository that contains all the packages that were shipped on installation ISO. Some packages in that repository have versions less then in upstream, and will be reinstalled when upstream repository enabled. We are going to solve this using the following approach: * Create a separate repository named 'mos8.0-base' using whitelist. Only those packages that were rebuilt by Mirantis and can't be replaced with upstream packages are listed there. * On master node disable 'nailgun' repository. * On master node enable 'mos8.0-base' repository with priority 10 (that is higher then default value of 100). The last problem is package naming - we've built some packages that have different names in upstream, and can't be updated by ``yum`` because it doen't know anything about their relations. So we have to use ``yum shell`` and explicitely define packages that should be removed and installed instead. **Updating docker containers** The only way to update a container is to rebuild it from updated image. Updated images can be received from 'mos8.0-updates' channel as 'fuel-docker-images' RPM package. Every docker container have only one repository enabled - local 'nailgun' repository. It is used only once, when a container is being created by 'dockerctl build' command. Since no updates can be received via 'nailgun' repository, no packages can be updated inside a container during its lifecycle. We keep original 'nailgun' repository intact, but we also changing content of '/etc/yum.repos.d/' folder on master node. This folder is shared with every container, and as soon as we change it and enable upstream CentOS repositories (via published snapshots of course) a container can install updates if there is ``yum update`` somewhere. To avoid the following is suggested: * configure upstream repositories (base, extras, updates) and immediately disable them all * set priority 10 for 'mos8.0-base' repository and disable it * keep 'nailgun' repository enabled In such configuration containers will not receive any updates from other repositories since they are disabled by default. In such case the following command should be used to install packages to the host system: :: $ sudo yum --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=mos8.0-base --enablerepo=base \ > --enablerepo=extras --enablerepo=updates <yum arguments> Another way is to create a copy of /etc/yum.repos.d and modify mounts for every container: * copy original /etc/yum.repos.d to /etc/yum.repos.d.nailgun * modify default mounts in dockerctl's config file so that it will use /etc/yum.repos.d.nailgun instead of /etc/yum.repos.d * rebuild every docker container to apply the changes made **Master node upgrade tool** To upgrade master node a tool named fuel-distupgrade was developed. It's a POC written in bash and will be implemented as part of fuel-upgrade tool. fuel-distupgrade does the following actions: * fuel-distupgrade prepare * verifies that master node can be upgraded (there is enough resources for that) and prepares it for upgrade * creates backup of /boot partition and LVM snapshots for others * stops services that shouldn't run during upgrade * fuel-distupgrade update * creates mos8.0-base repo * configures yum repositories correctly * replaces packages and updates master node * fuel-distupgrade commit * makes changes persistent after successfull updgrade * fuel-distupgrade rollback * reverts changes back is upgrade failed * fuel-distupgrade finalize * finlize upgrade process after either 'commit' or 'rollback' Web UI ====== None Nailgun ======= Data model ---------- None REST API -------- None Orchestration ============= None RPC Protocol ------------ None Fuel Client =========== None Plugins ======= None Fuel Library ============ None ------------ Alternatives ------------ There are two alternative ways to deliver updates to master node: * Fetch some packages from upstream, create micro repositories and deliver them in form of tarballs. This might work several times, but at some moment it might happen that a lot of dependent packages must be included to the tarball. * Fetch sources, rebuild packages, deliver them via mos7.0-updates repository. That's a bad approach since we will end up with rebuilding glibc, kernel, etc. Both variants require a lot of manual work, and every security update made by any way will differ from previous one. -------------- Upgrade impact -------------- This feature affects the upgrade process of the Fuel Master node. It must be reflected in corresponding updates to fuel-upgrade code for versions where the feature will be supported (at least version 8.0), since the fuel-upgrade already does manage repositories in its own way. **Updating packages on master node** As was mentioned before, the following command should be used to manipulate packages on host system: :: $ sudo yum --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=mos8.0-base --enablerepo=base \ > --enablerepo=extras --enablerepo=updates <yum arguments> For example, to update glibc: :: $ sudo yum --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=mos8.0-base --enablerepo=base \ > --enablerepo=extras --enablerepo=updates update glibc --------------- Security impact --------------- The proposed solution allows to fix security / bugs the fastest way. It also reduces our technical debt and should remove significant amount of work from support teams. -------------------- Notifications impact -------------------- None --------------- End user impact --------------- None ------------------ Performance impact ------------------ Some performance impact might exist caused by fixes or regressions introduced to base system packages. However we may detect such issues before publishing snapshots, so customers are safe here. ----------------- Deployment impact ----------------- None ---------------- Developer impact ---------------- None --------------------- Infrastructure impact --------------------- * CI snapshotting should be improved to support several CentOS releases. * A placeholder for published repositories is required on our mirror. -------------------- Documentation impact -------------------- This feature should be documented because it's intended to performed on customer's side without support stuff. -------------- Implementation -------------- TBD Assignee(s) =========== Primary assignee: teselkin-d Other contributors: isuzdal Mandatory design review: kozhukalov gelbuhos Work Items ========== * Infra team to update snapshotting - snapshot names should include CentOS release number as part of it's name. * Infra team to create a placeholder for repositories to be published. * CI / Infra team to create a job that publishes snapshot under a fixed name (using the placeholder above), and prevents those packages from deletion when snapshot becomes too old. * MOS Linux team to implement 'fuel-distupgrade' as part of 'fuel-upgrade' tool. Dependencies ============ TBD ------------ Testing, QA ------------ * QA framework shold be improved to support master node upgrade scenario as part of our standard tests (BVT / smoke / SWARM). * A set of tests that allows us to make a decision that snapshot is 'good enough' to be published should be created. * Periodic job that runs a set of tests mentioned above should be created. Acceptance criteria =================== Please specify clearly defined acceptance criteria for proposed changes. ---------- References ---------- [0] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/274118/ ",,536,0

The repo container's package cache causes quite a bit of confusion
given that it's a 'hidden' feature which catches deployers off-guard
when they already have their own cache configured. This is really
the kind of service which people should manage outside of OSA. It
also makes no sense if the deployer is using their own local mirror
which is a fairly common practise. Adding to that, it seems that it
is broken in bionic, causing massive delays in package installs.
Finally, it also adds to quite a bit of complexity due to the fact
that it's in a container - so in the playbooks prior to the container's
existence we have to detect whether it's there and add/remove the config
accordingly.

Let's just remove it and let deployers managing their own caching
infrastructure if they want it.

The repo container's package cache causes quite a bit of confusion
given that it's a 'hidden' feature which catches deployers off-guard
when they already have their own cache configured. This is really
the kind of service which people should manage outside of OSA. It
also makes no sense if the deployer is using their own local mirror
which is a fairly common practise. Adding to that, it seems that it
is broken in bionic, causing massive delays in package installs.
Finally, it also adds to quite a bit of complexity due to the fact
that it's in a container - so in the playbooks prior to the container's
existence we have to detect whether it's there and add/remove the config
accordingly.

Let's just remove it and let deployers managing their own caching
infrastructure if they want it.

Although using 'os_auth_ver' parameter is deprecated, freezer-api (or
freezer-web-ui respectively) still uses it to generate configs for jobs.
Commit 50df2c8 introduced regression causing freezer-agent refusing to
start when config passed via '--config' contains 'os_auth_ver' parameter
(or any other deprecated option). The root cause is that loop (L568)
iterates through keys defined in config file passed via '--config'
therefore trying to call CONF.set_override with deprecated 'os_auth_ver'
as a first argument which causes oslo.config library to raise
KeyError: 'os-identity-api-version' as CONF.set_override is not expected
to be called with deprecated options. This simple patch adds call for
get for each key which may (correctly) raise NoSuchOptError for undefined
(and deprecated) keys, thus safely fallbacking to except routine.

To enable split logging functionality [1] we need to register

There are two options to add this new 'split_logger' config option

1. In Keystonemiddleware, as it is done for other config options
'certfile', 'keyfile', 'cafile', 'insecure' config option.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

It turns out that a host can have multiple valid default gateways,
something that's not common in ipv4.

This patches add supports for multiple default gateways in ipv6
environments.

When we create or retype a volume using the volume type which
has a uuid format type name, the operation would be failed and
raise a 404 error.

There are a uuid check in ""get_by_name_or_id()"", and the
uuid-like type name would be mistakenly recognized as a id,
will use ""get_volume_type""(by_id) to get volume type .

So, this patch try to fix this error, if we can't find a
type by uuid, we need call ""get_volume_type_by_name"" to check
again if we can get this type by name.

This patch renames the set_and_clear_allocations function in the
scheduler report client to move_allocations and adds handling of
consumer generation conflict for it. This call now moves everything from
one consumer to another and raises AllocationMoveFailed to the caller if
the move fails due to consumer generation conflict.

When migration or resize fails to move the source host allocation to the
migration_uuid then the API returns HTTP 409 and the migration is aborted.

If reverting a migration, a resize, or a resize to same host fails to move
the source host allocation back to the instance_uuid due consumer generation
conflict the instance will be put into ERROR state. The instance still has two
allocations in this state and deleting the instance only deletes the one that
is held by the instance_uuid. This patch logs an ERROR describing that in this
case the allocation held by the migration_uuid is leaked.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

However in angular create instance server groups tab, the server

On centos7.2, it doesn't happen every time, but sometimes, partprobe
fails with error `Device or resource busy` in _fix_gpt_structs. In fact,
this is not a problem, I tried ignoring this error and ran remain code.
Things went well. The target of running `partprobe` is to check GPT
table, we can run `sgdisk -v` instead.

This patch is to replace `partprobe` command in _fix_gpt_structs to
avoid `Device or resource busy` error.

This patch adds a new role called OpenShiftInfra which is required to
define infra nodes. We've been bundling infra nodes with compute and
master nodes and they ought to be independent.

With the new node label management introduced in openshift-ansible, it
sounds like this is a good time for us to unbundle these nodes.

The current hash ring code suffers from several problems:

1. The cache is reset on any get_topic_for call, which means that the
   cache is not used between API calls. Previously it was done to work
   around the situation when a new conductor is not visible until the API
   process restarts. Currently we refresh the hash rings periodically.

   This patch removes resetting the cache. To avoid waiting 2 minutes to
   be able to use a new driver:
   1) the hash ring cache is always rebuilt when a ring is not found,
   2) the hash_ring_reset_interval option was changed to 15 seconds.

2. The reset of the cache races with the hot path in the get_ring call.
   It is possible that the reset happens after the class-level cache
   variable is checked but before it is used, yielding None.

   This patch stores the value of the class-level variable to a local
   variable before checking, thus ensuring None is never returned.

Finally, some logging was added to the modified code to make this kind
of problems more debugable in the future.

In order to get volume metrics sended to ceilometer,
cinder-volume-usage-audit must be manually runned (or with cron/systemd timer).
Similar to nova approach (volume_usage_audit_period in cinder.conf)

So this change add cinder_volume_usage_audit variable,

Job uses another type of quotes, due to escaping problems

This patch implements live migration of instances across compute nodes.
Each compute node must be managing a cluster in the same vCenter and ESX
hosts must have vMotion enabled [1].
If the instance is located on a datastore shared between source

A buch of defaults oslomsg related variables were configured.
In case of enabling ceilometer for services, role failed unless
all required vars has been specified manually by deployer.

Also vars ceilometer_oslomsg_rpc_servers
and ceilometer_oslomsg_notify_servers were removed
They were not used anywhere except ceilometer.conf.j2
and might be easily replaced with host_group vars.
Their removal allowed to simplify macros.

Fixed distro_install functional test for ubuntu,
as ceilometer-agent-notification package was missing.

The current hash ring code suffers from several problems:

1. The cache is reset on any get_topic_for call, which means that the
   cache is not used between API calls. Previously it was done to work
   around the situation when a new conductor is not visible until the API
   process restarts. Currently we refresh the hash rings periodically.

   This patch removes resetting the cache. To avoid waiting 2 minutes to
   be able to use a new driver:
   1) the hash ring cache is always rebuilt when a ring is not found,
   2) the hash_ring_reset_interval option was changed to 15 seconds.

2. The reset of the cache races with the hot path in the get_ring call.
   It is possible that the reset happens after the class-level cache
   variable is checked but before it is used, yielding None.

   This patch stores the value of the class-level variable to a local
   variable before checking, thus ensuring None is never returned.

Finally, some logging was added to the modified code to make this kind
of problems more debugable in the future.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

Several operations (e.g. stack check) are yet to be converted to
convergence-style workflows, and still create locks. While we try to always
remove dead locks, it's possible that if one of these gets left behind we
won't notice, since convergence doesn't actually use stack locks for most
regular operations.

When doing _check_status_complete() on a nested stack resource, we wait for
the operation to release the nested stack's lock before reporting the
resource completed, to ensure that for legacy operations the nested stack
is ready to perform another action on as soon as the resource is complete.
For convergence stacks this is an unnecessary DB call, and it can lead to
resources never completing if a stray lock happens to be left in the
database.

Only check the nested stack's stack lock for operations where we are not
taking a resource lock. This corresponds exactly to legacy-style
operations.

This is modified from master to inline the _should_lock_on_action()
method, which does not exist on this branch.

The IPA ramdisk and kernel images may be built or downloaded via a URL.
If the latter option is used, any images previously downloaded to
$KOLLA_CONFIG_PATH/config/ironic/ironic-agent.* would previously not be
updated if the image contents change.

This change introduces variables for setting a URL to a file containing
checksums for the images. The algorithm used to compute the checksum is
also configurable (default sha256). This allows us to ensure we are
using the correct version of the image, while avoiding an expensive few
hundred megabyte image download just to check.

If a checksum is not specified, the image will be downloaded every time
to ensure that it is up to date.

Some open questions:
  - A bunch of internal imports (more than I hoped)
  - We need mistral as a test requirement - it isn't in global requirements
  - sqlite only so far (possibly a good thing)
  - We need to manually register every action we use - unless it is a tripleo
    action, then it is added automatically thanks to setup.cfg, but we need to
    mock it. Re-registering a new action may be easier than mocking, if that
    works
  - Tests are heavily tied to Mistral internals and database. We should
    probably write a bunch of helper methods to abstract anything we access
    should it change later. I'd hope only one file would ever import from
    Mistral directly.
  - We *might* need to run these in their own dedicated test suite. There
    seems to be an issue where it is causing other tripleo-common tests to
    hang. Due to eventlet monkey patching maybe?

Currently horizon will display the backups panel regardless of
whether or not cinder-backup is set to True or False. While the
panel is view-only (the create backup cmd will be removed from
volumes in the volumes panel) some people might not want it
there at all so this new config opt allows defining a role e.g.
""cinder_backup_panel_viewer"" and changing the default of
""rule:admin_or_owner"" to ""role:cinder_backup_panel_viewer"" so
that the operator can either block everyone from seeing the panel
or add it selectively.
