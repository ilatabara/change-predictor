In neutron when multiple IPv6 subnets on the same
network are added to a router interface, the router
interface port is updated with multiple fixed_ips rather
than creating a new port. In the case of IPv4 subnets
a new port is created for every added interface.

For dvr routers there are internal snat ports that are
created for every router interface that is added to a
router. So when multiple IPv6 subnets on the same network
was added to a dvr router, the internal snat ports were not
appended with the IPv6 prefix properly.

An error log message was thrown for the SNAT port not
matching the given internal port for the IPv6 address.

This patch will address this issue when IPv6 subnets are
added or removed from the dvr router that are on the
same network.

In Ieffd37f9d49b53c36da31916a6af4f3bfe11d411 we added a cap on Pillow as
Pillow 3.0.0 required additional C development headers to be present to

Remove the upper cap now.

GAs currently initialize their configuration directories right in the
service __init__. This is not necessary until the first configuration
changes get applied.
We have seen cases when the 'mkdir'/'chmod'/'chown' commands fail to
return within the 30s timeout limit on slow/heavily-loaded
(during cluster creation) machines.

This patch set defers the directory initialization until first overrides
get applied.

As noted by Thai in his review for the patch
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/213879/, the hz-page-header
directive should be updated to allow string interpolations
such as {$ ... $} in order to support angular translate.

This patch can be tested by setting DISABLED = False in
_1051_project_ng_images_panel.py and _3031_identity_users_panel.py
and checking the header translation with the pseudo
translation tool.

The change updates the logic within nova such to it will
now correctly set the management interface when using
a dynamic inventory without the container_networks options
within it.

This also updates the container create play so that it too
will properly skip a host that also may not have the container
networks entries within it's inventory configs.

Get noop drivers to function within flows

The noop drivers suffered from not being updated and just not being tested
with being called within flows like normal real op drivers.  This gets the noop
drivers to succeed when called liked other drivers.  They do not do anything
and will return fake information whenever it is required they return data.
This can be improved later so that they actually do their own data store, but
that would require a much larger update and I'm not sure there's much value
in it.

Now we use conntrack tools to manage ip_conntrack, if sg rules or
members change, l2 agent will use conntrack tools to clean up the
unused ip_conntrack between VMs, but there are some problems in
bellow use cases:
1. there are many VMs in a default sg(etc. 200 VMs), when we bulk
   delete these VMs, the l2 agents need to cost much time to clean
   up the ip_conntrack.
2. when we create a VM in one compute node, the port's status change
   from DOWN -> BUILD -> ACTIVE, self.devices_with_udpated_sg_members
   in IptablesFirewallDriver record twice, so conntrack command exec
   twice for one ip_conntrack.
This patch does the bellow changes:
1. add config option for cleaning ip_conntrack, the default value is
   False, if user's cloud scale is small or user can accept the
   consumption, he can set this option to True.
2. make self.devices_with_udpated_sg_members just record the ACTIVE
   port, so when sg rules or members change, conntrack command for
   one ip_conntrack just exec one time.

Deployments should not be run again when a server is rebooted because

change moves the deployed directory from /var/run/heat-config/deployed

For example, designs that use both an OpenStack-based private cloud and an OpenStack-based public cloud, or that use an OpenStack cloud and a non-OpenStack cloud, are hybrid clouds. Bursting describes the practice of creating new instances in an external cloud to alleviate capacity issues in a private cloud. * Example scenarios suited to hybrid clouds * Bursting from a private cloud to a public cloud * Disaster recovery * Development and testing * Federated cloud, enabling users to choose resources from multiple providers * Supporting legacy systems as they transition to the cloud Hybrid clouds interact with systems that are outside the control of the private cloud administrator, and require careful architecture to prevent conflicts with hardware, software, and APIs under external control. The degree to which the architecture is OpenStack-based affects your ability to accomplish tasks with native OpenStack tools. By definition, this is a situation in which no single cloud can provide all of the necessary functionality. In order to manage the entire system, we recommend using a cloud management platform (CMP). There are several commercial and open source CMPs available, but there is no single CMP that can address all needs in all scenarios, and sometimes a manually-built solution is the best option. This chapter includes discussion of using CMPs for managing a hybrid cloud.",,29,0

Where he is using a co-located facility, Bob ensures that his systems are physically separated from the rest of the building by a cage and is only accessible through logged and monitored keycard access. In stand-alone datacenters, Bob ensures proper security throughout the facility, including local security and separated physical security.

These are the set of guidelines for OSC developers that help keep the interface and commands consistent. In some cases (like the boolean variables below) we use the same pattern for defining and using options in all situations. The alternative of only using it when necessary leads to errors when copy-n-paste is used for a new command without understanding why or why not that instance is correct. Boolean Options =============== Boolean options for any command that sets a resource state, such as 'enabled' or 'public', shall always have both positive and negative options defined. The names of those options shall either be a naturally occuring pair of words (in English) or a positive option and a negative option with `no-` prepended (such as in the traditional GNU option usage) like `--share` and `--no-share`. In order to handle those APIs that behave differently when a field is set to `None` and when the field is not present in a passed argument list or dict, each of the boolean options shall set its own variable to `True` as part of a mutiually exclusive group, rather than the more common configuration of setting a single destination variable `True` or `False` directly. This allows us to detect the situation when neither option is present (both variables will be `False`) and act accordingly for those APIs where this matters. This also requires that each of the boolean values be tested in the `take_action()` method to correctly set (or not) the underlying API field values. .. option:: --enable Enable <resource> (default) .. option:: --disable Disable <resource> Implementation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The parser declaration should lokk like this:: enable_group = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group() enable_group.add_argument( '--enable', action='store_true', help=_('Enable <resource> (default)'), ) enable_group.add_argument( '--disable', action='store_true', help=_('Disable <resource>'), ) An example handler in `take_action()`:: # This leaves 'enabled' undefined if neither option is present if parsed_args.enable: kwargs['enabled'] = True if parsed_args.disable: kwargs['enabled'] = False List Command Options ==================== Additional Fields ----------------- Most list commands only return a subset of the available fields by default. Additional fields are available with the `--long` option. All list commands should allow `--long` even if they return all fields by default. .. option:: --long List additional fields in output Implementation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The parser declaration should lokk like this:: parser.add_argument( '--long', action='store_true', default=False, help='List additional fields in output', ) Pagination ---------- There are many ways to do pagination, some OpenStack APIs supprot it, some don't. OpenStackClient attempts to define a single common way to specify pagination on the command line. .. option:: --marker <marker> Anchor for paging .. option:: --limit <limit> Limit number of <resource> returned (*integer*) Implementation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The parser declaration should lokk like this:: parser.add_argument( ""--marker"", metavar=""<marker>"", help=""Anchor for paging"", ) parser.add_argument( ""--limit"", metavar=""<limit>"", type=int, help=""Limit the number of <resource> returned"", ) ",,130,0

path that is too long. This leads to and error on our longest named
job which prevents tox from running at all.

This limitation is the limit for the line length of the first line
in a shell script. See `man execve` for more info. A quote from that
manpage: 'A maximum line length of 127 characters is allowed for the
first line in a #! executable shell script.'

Some unit tests are comparing XML using a string comparison, but
this is unsafe since the string representation can change
depending on the library used.

The XML matcher is copied from keystone from commit 4f0107e, which
is just before the XML matcher was removed from keystone since it
wasn't used anymore.

When using Zaqar as plugin in DevStack, after executing unstack.sh,
there's still Zaqar uwsgi master process with it's workers running:
/usr/local/bin/uwsgi --ini /etc/zaqar/uwsgi.conf
This process must be stopped.
Also running uwsgi process will prevent Zaqar to start on the next
execution of stack.sh.

The problem occurs, because of the nature of uwsgi container.
It just can't be stopped like that:
https://github.com/openstack/zaqar/blob/master/devstack/plugin.sh#L253

It must be stopped as described in uwsgi documentation:

This commit will make uwsgi container process stop correctly on
unstack.sh execution by using PID of the process as described in uwsgi
documentation.

There is an experimental gate job for Identity API
v3 only for DevStack and Tempest repositories,
where the Identity v2 API is disabled.

That job aims to verify that Tempest tests can run
with the described configuration, and consequently
services are compatible with the Identity API v3.

It was made experimental because DevStack was not
using the Identity API v3 to set resources up and
Tempest tests were failing. Now that they are
fixed, the job is passing (see change #213430 as
an example).

This change moves the job from the experimental
pipeline to the main check pipeline for the
DevStack project, making it non-voting for now.

The same change will be done for Tempest after the
Juno EOL date, because there are already too many
tempest jobs running on check.

The goal is, once there is enough confidence on
its stability, to make it voting.

The project gauges used to be sorted by failure rate, but a recent
change broke this behavior (_.sortBy and Array.sort work in slightly
different ways).

This refactors the comparison function to comply with Array.sort

This is the first step in updating PyECLib to 1.1.1. Once
this change lands, we plan to update Swift requirements to
>=1.0.7 before updating global-requirements and upper-
constraints to 1.1.1.

Context: The new version of PyECLib introduces native EC
backend named 'liberasurecode_rs_vand' that provides an
alternative to the current 'jerasure_rs_vand' default.
Also brings in a number of bug fixes including those for
issues on big-endian archs.

If you run the unit tests with a live /dev/disk/by-path
on the system, the tests fall through the skipUnless
decorators.  This exposed some failures in the expected
commands, which were incorrect.   The expected commands
in _test_connect_volume had assumed the multipath set of
commands which included a rescan.

This patch removes the rescan expected tests, as those
are only run for multipath related attaches.

If an unprivileged user, either intentionally or accidentally modifies or deletes any of the parameters or the file itself then it would cause severe availability issues causing a denial of service to the other end users. Thus user ownership of such critical configuration files must be set to root and group ownership must be set to horizon. Run the following commands: .. code:: console $ stat -L -c ""%U %G"" /etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings | egrep ""root horizon"" **Pass:** If user and group ownership of the config file is set to root and horizon respectively. The above commands show output of root horizon. **Fail:** If the above commands does not return any output as the user and group ownership might have set to any user other than root or any group other than horizon. .. _check_dashboard_02: Check-Dashboard-02: Are strict permissions set for horizon configuration files? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Similar to the previous check, it is recommended to set strict access permissions for such configuration files. Run the following commands: .. code:: console $ stat -L -c ""%a"" /etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings **Pass:** If permissions are set to 640 or stricter. The permissions of 640 translates into owner r/w, group r, and no rights to others i.e. ""u=rw,g=r,o="". Note that with :ref:`check_dashboard_01` and permissions set to 640, root has read/write access and horizon has read access to these configuration files. The access rights can also be validated using the following command. This command will only be available on your system if it supports ACLs. .. code:: console $ getfacl --tabular -a /etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names # file: etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings USER root rw- GROUP horizon r-- mask r-- other --- **Fail:** If permissions are not set to at least 640. .. _check_dashboard_03: Check-Dashboard-03: Is USE_SSL parameter set to True? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Openstack services communicate with each other using various protocols and the communication might involve sensitive/confidential information. An attacker may try to eavesdrop on the channel in order to get access to sensitive information. Thus all the services must communicate with each other using a secured communication protocol like HTTPS. **Pass:** If value of parameter ``USE_SSL`` in :file:`/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings` is set to ``True``. **Fail:** If value of parameter ``USE_SSL`` in :file:`/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings` is set to ``False``. Recommended in: :doc:`https-hsts-xss-ssrf`. .. _check_dashboard_04: Check-Dashboard-04: Is CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE parameter set to True? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CSRF (Cross-site request forgery) is an attack which forces an end user to execute unauthorized commands on a web application in which he/she is currently authenticated. A successful CSRF exploit can compromise end user data and operations in case of normal user. If the targeted end user has an admin priviledges, this can compromise the entire web application. **Pass:** If value of parameter ``CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`` in :file:`/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings` is set to ``True``. **Fail:** If value of parameter ``CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`` in :file:`/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings` is set to ``False``. Recommended in: :doc:`cookies`. .. _check_dashboard_05: Check-Dashboard-05: Is SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE parameter set to True? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The ""SECURE"" cookie attribute instructs web browsers to only send the cookie through an encrypted HTTPS (SSL/TLS) connection. This session protection mechanism is mandatory to prevent the disclosure of the session ID through MitM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks. It ensures that an attacker cannot simply capture the session ID from web browser traffic. **Pass:** If value of parameter ``SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`` in :file:`/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings` is set to ``True``. **Fail:** If value of parameter ``SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`` in :file:`/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings` is set to ``False``. Recommended in: :doc:`cookies`. .. _check_dashboard_06: Check-Dashboard-06: Is SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY parameter set to True? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The “HTTPONLY” cookie attribute instructs web browsers not to allow scripts (e.g. JavaScript or VBscript) an ability to access the cookies via the DOM ``document.cookie`` object. This session ID protection is mandatory to prevent session ID stealing through XSS attacks. **Pass:** If value of parameter ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`` in :file:`/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings` is set to ``True``. **Fail:** If value of parameter ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`` in :file:`/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings` is set to ``False``. Recommended in: :doc:`cookies`. Check-Dashboard-06: Is 'password_autocomplete': set to 'off'? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Common feature that applications use to provide users a convenience is to cache the password locally in the browser (on the client machine) and having it 'pre-typed' in all subsequent requests. While this feature can be perceived as extremely friendly for the average user, at the same time, it introduces a flaw, as the user account becomes easily accessible to anyone that uses the same account on the client machine and thus may lead to compromise of the user account. **Pass:** If value of parameter ``password_autocomplete`` in :file:`/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings` is set to ``off``. **Fail:** If value of parameter ``password_autocomplete`` in :file:`/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings` is set to ``on``.

Horizon Juno does not have hostname validation in AngularJS launch instance
form. For example, you can create a new instance with name: ""#3rtttt""

That name will cause problems when Nova try to handle, but Horizon allow
launch a new instance with a not valid hostname. A valid hostname is
specified by RFC1123 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123).

This patch is quite similar to

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =================================================================== Libvirt: Support for attaching volumes located on Virtuozzo Storage =================================================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-vzstorage-volume-support Currently, there are Libvirt volume drivers that support network-attached file systems such as Gluster, NFS or SMB. The purpose of this blueprint is to add ability to attach volumes hosted by Virtuozzo Storage. Problem description =================== Virtuozzo Storage is a fault-tolerant distributed storage system, optimized for virtualization workloads. From client's point of view it looks like network attached storage (NFS or GlusterFS). Virtuozzo Storage allows to use disk space of conventional linux systems to provide fault-tolerant storage with automatic recovery. It's optimized for performance of virtualization workloads and has strong data consistency. Use Cases ---------- Deployer will be able to attach block storage exported in the form of virtual disks on Virtuozzo Storage to instances. Project Priority ----------------- None Proposed change =============== A new volume driver will be added in order to support attaching volumes located on Virtuozzo Storage. The volume driver will have a similiar workflow as NFS and SMBFS volume drivers have. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- The share credentials will be parsed in the volume connection info and used when mounting a Virtuozzo Storage cluster. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- The deployer will be able to configure the path where the Virtuoozo Storage clusters will be mounted, as well as setting mount flags. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: <dguryanov@virtuozzo.com> Work Items ---------- Add support for mounting Virtuozzo Storage clusters. Documentation Impact ==================== Using the Virtuozzo Storage backend will be documented.

Openstack CLI utilities can return warning messages while
run to stderr. It's a normal behavior for Openstack CLI.
But Puppet mixs stderr and stdout for commands.

For preventing parsing warning messages,
I propose got response from Neutron CLI as JSON if it required
and parse it by ruby JSON parser.

JSON is a more usable format for interprocess communication,
than plain-text or CSV.

The setup in TestNetworkAdvancedServerOps unconditionally uses floating
IPs to verify the connection to the server instance, which will fail if
CONF.compute.ssh_connect_method != 'floating', so we need to add that
skip check.

Note that the help text for CONF.network.tenant_networks_reachable says:

""Whether tenant networks can be reached directly from the test client.
This must be set to True when the 'fixed' ssh_connect_method is
selected.""

However, if you set tenant_networks_reachable=True and have
ssh_connect_method=fixed, the test would still not be skipped and fail.

It contains object store with OpenStack Swift compatible API. Glance image service can use Ceph storage via RADOS Gateway Swift API. RADOS Gateway and OpenStack Swift use different format of temporary URL. Ironic added support for RADOS GW temporary URL in the Mitaka release. Configure Ironic and Glance with RADOS Gateway ============================================== #. Install Ceph storage with RADOS Gateway, `Ceph documentation <http://docs.ceph.com/docs>`_. #. Create a RADOS GW user for Glance (the following commands should be executed on RADOS admin host):: sudo radosgw-admin user create --uid=""glanceuser"" --display-name=""User for Glance"" #. Create a subuser for Swift API:: sudo radosgw-admin subuser create --uid=glanceuser --subuser=glanceuser:swift --access=full #. Add a key for Swift API access:: sudo radosgw-admin key create --subuser=glanceuser:swift --key-type=swift --secret=secretkey Note: do not use ""--gen-secret"" CLI parameter. radosgw-admin utility generates keys with slash symbols which are not work with Glance. #. Add a key for Swift API temporary URLs:: sudo radosgw-admin user modify --uid=glanceuser --temp-url-key=tempsecret #. Configure Glance API service for RADOS Swift API as backend. Edit the configuration file for the Glance API service (is typically located at ``/etc/glance/glance-api.conf``). Replace RADOS_IP with the IP of the RADOS GW API service:: [glance_store] stores = file, http, swift default_store = swift swift_store_auth_version = 1 swift_store_auth_address = http://RADOS_IP:PORT/auth/1.0 swift_store_user = glanceuser:swift swift_store_key = secretkey swift_store_container = glance swift_store_create_container_on_put = True Note: RADOS GW uses FastCGI protocol for interacting with HTTP server. Read your HTTP server documentation if you want enable HTTPS support. #. Restart Glance API service and upload all needed images. #. Change Ironic configuration file on the conductor host(s):: [glance] swift_container = glance swift_api_version = v1 swift_endpoint_url = http://RADOS_IP:PORT swift_temp_url_key = tempsecret temp_url_endpoint_type=radosgw #.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ======================== Shared Resource Handling ======================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/share-resources Adds a way to handle resources that are shared among compute nodes. Problem description =================== Within a cloud deployment, there are a number of resources that may be consumed by a user. Some resource types are provided by individual compute nodes; these types of resources include CPU, memory, PCI devices and local ephemeral disk. Other types of resources, however, are provided by some external resource pool, and shared among many compute nodes. An example of such a resource would be a shared storage pool like that provided by Ceph or an NFS share. Unfortunately, due to legacy reasons, Nova only thinks of resources as being provided by a compute node. The tracking of resources assumes that it is the compute node that provides the resource, and therefore when reporting usage of certain resources, Nova naively calculates resource usage and availability by simply summing amounts across all compute nodes in its database. This ends up causing a number of problems [1] with usage and capacity amounts being incorrect. A proposal for a solution to this problem [2] has been put forth by Jay Pipes, and this spec is largely copied from that one. I think that while that approach will work, it does much more than simply solve the shared resource problem: it also implements the direct claiming of resources by the scheduler, and does so with a very complex set of changes and data relationships. The problem we originally set out to solve is that hosts that share a resource don't know when their shared resource changes, and so will continue to report an incorrect amount until their next periodic call to update_available_resource(). Use Cases ---------- As a deployer that has chosen to use a shared storage solution for storing instance ephemeral disks, I want Nova and Horizon to report the correct usage and capacity information. Proposed change =============== Imagine that the Nova deployment had a collection of compute nodes that did *not* provide instances with any local disk, and instead used a shared storage pool for housing the instance's ephemeral disks. We would first create a host aggregate that contained all such compute nodes:: nova host-aggregate-create ... We would then add a metadata key to that aggregate to mark it as a shared-resource aggregate. We can bikeshed the key name, but for now let's just called it ""shared_resource"". When the scheduler selects a host, it checks to see if it is part of a host aggregate that has the ""shared_resource"" metadata key, and if so, sends a message to the other hosts to re-calculate their available resources by the claimed amount. This could be done be adding a new method to nova/compute/rpcapi.py, or by adding an additional handler to the existing external_instance_event() method. Alternatively, the compute_node objects for those hosts could be updated directly, but that seems like it should wait until the scheduler handles all resource claiming directly. Alternatives ------------ We can implement the spec as envisioned by Jay Pipes. Or, as Jay suggests, we can continue to report incorrect usage information for shared storage pools. Data model impact ----------------- None. There are no changes to the existing data model needed. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ There will be a small cost to the scheduler calling the db's aggregate_get_by_host() method on each call to see if there are other hosts that share a resource with the selected one. In the case where hosts do share resources, there will also be a cost for messaging other hosts in the shared resource aggregate to have them update themselves. Other deployer impact --------------------- Deployers who use shared resources will have to define the host aggregates initially for all hosts that share resources. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Ed Leafe <ed-leafe> Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Add the aggregate-checking code to the scheduler. * Determine the proper way to notify other hosts in the aggregate, and add the code to handle that. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= Tests will be created that create resource-shared aggregates, and then (mock) boot an image on one, having the shared resource decreased. The tests will ensure that the desired notification messages are sent to the other hosts in the aggregate. Documentation Impact ==================== None.

This might need a microversion bump, so submit for discussion.

When a flavor is deleted, it should not be queried by command
nova flavor-show xxx. But currently nova will return the info
even if it's deleted. An alternative is to add some option such
as --force to force query it by admin.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================================ Fernet keys rotation in HA mode ============================================ https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/fernet-tokens-support Implement generation and copying(installing) fernet keys during openstack deployment process (HA-mode), determine a mechanism of fernet keys rotation and synchronization. Problem description =================== Fernet tokens don't support HA mode, realization of this task was entrusted on devops. Fernet tokens store keys on local file system and can be periodically rotated by using ""keystone-manage"" tool. Such approach works only in single controller mode. It means that fernet tokens don't have mechanisms that allow to generate, synchronize keys during deployment process with HA mode and don't have built-in tools to rotate, synchronize fernet keys between all keystone nodes working in HA mode. Its critical to have the same keys on all keystone nodes at the same time to provide proper token validation through all controllers. Changes proposed in this spec should solve a problem with supporting HA mode for fernet tokens. Proposed change =============== Task of HA mode support for Fernet tokens can be devided into two parts: * provide Fernet encryption keys generation/installation during deployment process; * provide automatic scheduled Fernet enctyption keys rotation between all keystone nodes; 1. Fernet keys generation/installation during deployment process (HA mode) As Fernet tokens don't support HA mode installation for keystone we propose to implement this functionality using puppet manifests of fuel-library. It will provide a possibility to generate and install fernet keys to all keystone nodes during deployment process. To generate keys we should add an aditional function to ""osnailyfacter/modular/astute/generate_keys.sh"" script, it will use ""openssl"" tool for keys generation. Function realization example: .. code-block:: function generate_fernet_keys { for i in $fernet_keys do local dir_path=${BASE_PATH}fernet-keys/ local key_path=$dir_path$i mkdir -p $dir_path if [ ! -f $key_path ]; then openssl rand -base64 32 -out $key_path 2>&1 else echo ""Key $key_path already exists"" fi done } Generated keys will be stored to /var/lib/fuel/keys/$cluster_id/fernet-keys directory on Fuel-Master node. To copy generated fernet keys to controller nodes during deployment process should be used astute. To do it osnailyfacter/modular/astute/tasks.yaml file will be updated, source and destination paths of keys will be added to ""copy_keys"" task of ""pre deployment"" section, example: .. code-block:: src: /var/lib/fuel/keys/{CLUSTER_ID}/fernet-keys/0 dst: /var/lib/astute/keystone/0 After copying fernet keys to all controller nodes , they will be installed to appropriate directory (/etc/keystone/fernet-keys) using puppet, example of realization: .. code-block:: if $token_provider == 'keystone.token.providers.fernet.Provider' { file { ""$fernet_key_repository"": source => $fernet_src_repository, mode => '0600', owner => 'keystone', group => 'keystone', recurse => true, require => Class['::keystone'], notify => Service['keystone'], } } To configure fernet tokens and use it by default, 'token_provider' keystone parameter will be set to 'keystone.token.providers.fernet.Provider' in puppet manifest, and 'revoke_by_id' parameter will be added and set to 'false'. 2. Fernet keys rotation/synchronization between all keystone nodes As fernet tokens don't support keys rotation and synchronization between keystone nodes during operation in HA mode we will use the algorithm that allows to solve this problem. To realize this algorithm a script running on all keystone nodes will be used and it will be run by ""cron"". Algorithm steps: * create a new key that planning be a ""staged"" (or ""0"") key. It will have the following name structure: <staged key designation >.<random numeric value>. Example: 0.3781143626814230 The key will be saved to /etc/keystone/fernet-keys/ directory and we will have the following list of keys in this directory, example: 0.3781143626814230 0 1 * generated in a controller node key will be copied/synced with others controllers of a cluster. For these needs ""rsync"" tool will be used. * when a keystone node gets all keys (from all keysone nodes) after mutual synchronization locally in /etc/keystone/fernet-keys/ directory, it will sort generated key and a key with the largest value will be selected and renamed to ""0"" key and another keys will be rotated.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Libvirt runtime image type ========================================== Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/runtime-image-type Libvirt qemu/parallels hypervisor is capable to deal with different images type. With this change we are going to add an ability to use a supplied image without converting it according to image_type config parameter. Problem description =================== Currently nova libvirt driver sticks to a configured by a nova.conf image type. It is not possible to use supplied image without conversion. Libvirt currently supports the following image types: RBD, LVM, QCOW2, RAW, PLOOP. It is inflexible to limit one node just for one type of image. Use Cases ---------- Let a user be flexible about image types usage on different compute nodes. This would allow them to use all existing catalog of images across all compute nodes without necessity to reconfigure this by images_type parameter. Proposed change =============== LibvirtDriver has a field called image_backend which is initialized just once when compute service starts. Let it be in an instance property rather than a property of the compute service property. Not to interfere with current behaviour we can introduce a new image backend type called 'Runtime' or something like this. Alternatives ------------ Let it be as it is. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- Just a new nova.conf option for images_type parameter in libvirt section. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- For those who are interested in this option there will be a necessity to specify a new config option. Developer impact ---------------- Other hypervisors detect particular type of image mostly in runtime. Hyperv, for instance, detects vhd or vhdx by header and doesn't need to specify which one to use by config. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: Maxim Nestratov mnestratov@virtuozzo.com Other contributors: Dmitry Guryanov dguryanov@virtuozzo.com Work Items ---------- To be done. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= Functional test is going to be implemented. Documentation Impact ==================== A new nova.conf images_type option should be mentioned in documentation with description. References ========== None. ",,134,0

In an environment where reclaim_instance_interval is set to
non-zero in nova, an delete request will only soft delete an
instance.(status=SOFT_DELETED, so that the instance can be reclaimed
if required by using 'nova restore <instance_id>')

Now in the above environment, when an delete stack is requested by
user, stack will hang until reclaim_instance_inerval or timeout.
Hence status=SOFT_DELETED for an instance should be handled by heat, which
this patch proposes.

Currently Dockerfile checks if ""old"" manifest exists, and if not,
proceeds to the to-be-introduced one. This behavior makes it
impossible to make CI pass for I1657ce22be62414abd4a407a5d28292f25915a7b.

The modified conditional will fallback to the old manifest only if new
one doesn't exist.

ml2 plugin overrides delete_subnet and do not call super(),
so pluggable IPAM action defined in db_base_plugin_v2 are not called.
As a result subnets can not be deleted from IPAM driver if ml2 plugin
is used.

Added ipam.delete_subnet call into ml2 delete_subnet.
Patch includes UT to verify IPAM driver is called on subnet
allocation and deallocation.
Test class is inherited from TestMl2SubnetsV2, so all SubnetV2 tests are
additionally executed for ml2 plugin with reference IPAM driver.

Additionally, for own internal usage OpenStack requires SQL database server and AMQP broker. The physical servers, where all the components are running are often called controllers. This modular OpenStack architecture allows to duplicate all the components and run them on different controllers. By making all the components redundant it is possible to make OpenStack highly-available. In general we can divide all the OpenStack components into three categories: - OpenStack APIs, these are HTTP(s) stateless services written in python, easy to duplicate and mostly easy to load balance. - SQL relational database server provides stateful type consumed by other components. Supported databases are MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL. Making SQL database redundant is complex. - AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) provides OpenStack internal stateful communication service. In highly-available configuration all the services are redundant and distributed among multiple OpenStack controllers. There are three different type of redundancy: - Passive redundancy where one instance is active and there is at least one standby instance, cold standby. - Active redundancy where only one instance handles incoming request. All spare instances, called also hot standby are ready to become active without loosing any data. - Load-shared redundancy where multiple instances share the incoming requests. Assuming that every single OpenStack controller runs full set of the elementary services (symmetric controller), the common good practice is to have a small odd number of controllers. Most of the time, it means three OpenStack controllers. ",A highly-available OpenStack environment must have a controller cluster with three or more nodes. The following components are normally included in the cluster.,35,3

Make additional design decisions about monitoring and alarming. This can be an internal responsibility or the responsibility of the external provider. In the case of using an external provider, service level agreements (SLAs) likely apply. In addition, other operational considerations such as bandwidth, latency, and jitter can be part of an SLA. Consider the ability to upgrade the infrastructure. As demand for network resources increase, operators add additional IP address blocks and add additional bandwidth capacity. In addition, consider managing hardware and software life cycle events, for example upgrades, decommissioning, and outages, while avoiding service interruptions for tenants. Factor maintainability into the overall network design. This includes the ability to manage and maintain IP addresses as well as the use of overlay identifiers including VLAN tag IDs, GRE tunnel IDs, and MPLS tags. As an example, if you may need to change all of the IP addresses on a network, a process known as renumbering, then the design must support this function. Address network-focused applications when considering certain operational realities. For example, consider the impending exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, the migration to IPv6, and the use of private networks to segregate different types of traffic that an application receives or generates. In the case of IPv4 to IPv6 migrations, applications should follow best practices for storing IP addresses. We recommend you avoid relying on IPv4 features that did not carry over to the IPv6 protocol or have differences in implementation. To segregate traffic, allow applications to create a private tenant network for database and storage network traffic. Use a public network for services that require direct client access from the internet. Upon segregating the traffic, consider quality of service (QoS) and security to ensure each network has the required level of service. Finally, consider the routing of network traffic. For some applications, develop a complex policy framework for routing. To create a routing policy that satisfies business requirements, consider the economic cost of transmitting traffic over expensive links versus cheaper links, in addition to bandwidth, latency, and jitter requirements. Additionally, consider how to respond to network events. As an example, how load transfers from one link to another during a failure scenario could be a factor in the design. If you do not plan network capacity correctly, failover traffic could overwhelm other ports or network links and create a cascading failure scenario. In this case, traffic that fails over to one link overwhelms that link and then moves to the subsequent links until all network traffic stops. ",,416,0

Problem description =================== When plugging VIFs into VM instances there is communication between Nova and Neutron to obtain a dict of port binding metadata. Nova passes this along to the virt drivers which have a set of classes for dealing with different VIF types. In the libvirt case, each class has three methods, one for building the libvirt XML config, one for performing host OS config tasks related to plugging a VIF and one for performing host OS config tasks related to unplugging a VIF. Currently, whenever a new Neutron mechanism is created, this results in the definition of a new VIF type, and the addition of a new VIF class to the libvirt driver to support it. Due to the wide variety of vendors, there is a potentially limitless number of Neutron mechanisms that need to be dealt with over time. Conversely the number of different libvirt XML configurations is quite small and well defined. There are sometimes new libvirt XML configs defined, as QEMU gains new network backends, but this is fairly rare. The vast majority of Neutron mechanisms work against one of the two TAP based backends in libvirt/QEMU, so have roughly identical configuration at the libvirt level. The problem with this architecture is that the Nova libvirt maintainers have task of maintaining the plug/unplug code in the VIF drivers, which is really code that is defined by the needs of the Neutron mechanism. This prevents Neutron project / vendors from adding new VIF types without having a lock-step change in Nova. A second related problem, is that the format of the data passed between Nova and Neutron for the VIF port binding is fairly loosely defined. There is no versioning of the information passed between them and no agreed formal specification of what the different fields mean. This data is used both to generate the libvirt XML config and to control the logic of the plug/unplug actions. Use Cases ---------- The overall use case is to facilitate the creation of new Neutron mechanisms by removing Nova as a bottleneck for work. New features can be implemented entirely in the Neutron codebase (or mechanism specific codebase) with no need to add/change code in Nova, in the common case. Project Priority ----------------- De-gross-ification of networking ? </joke> Proposed change =============== Inspired the os-brick library effort started by the Cinder project, the proposal involves creation of a new library module that will be jointly developed by the Neutron & Nova teams, for consumption by both projects. The library will make use of the olso.versionedobjects module in order to formally define a set of objects to describe the VIF port binding data. The data in this objects will be serialized into JSON, for transmission between Neutron and Nova, just as is done with the current dicts used today. The difference is that by using olso.versionedobjects, we gain a formal specification and the ability to extend and modify the objects over time in a manner that is more future proof. One can imagine a base object from oslo_versionedobjects import base class VIFConfig(base.VersionedObject) # Common stuff for all VIFs fields = { # VIF port identifier id: UUIDField() # Various common fields see current # nova.network.model.VIF class and related ones ...snip... # Name of the class used for VIF (un)plugging actions plug: StringField() } This base object defines the fields that are common to all the different VIF port binding types. There are a number of this attributes, currently detailed in the VIF class in nova.network.model, or the equiv in Neutron. On addition here is a 'plug' field which will be the name of a class that will be used to perform the vendor specific plug/unplug work on the host OS. This de-coupling is what will allow the number of VIFConfig classes to remain at a fairly small finite size, while still allowing arbitary number of Neutron mechanisms to be implemented. The various VIFConfig subclasses will be created, based on the different bits of information that are currently passed around. NB, this is not covering all the current VIF_TYPE_XXX variants, as a number of them have essentially identical config parameter requirements, and only differ in the plug/unplug actions, hence the point previously about the 'plug' class name. All existing VIF types will be considered legacy. These various config classes will define a completely new set of modern VIF types. In many cases they will be practically identical to the existing VIF types, with the exception that the data passed from Neutron to Nova will be using the olso.versioned object serialization data. By defining a completely new set of VIF types, we make it easy for Nova to negotiate use of the new types with Neutron. When calling Neutron, Nova will indicate what VIF types it is capable ofo supporting, and thus Neutron can determine whether it is able to use the new object based VIF types or the legacy anoymous dict based types. This negotiation is touched on in this spec already https://review.openstack.org/#/c/190917/ So approximately the following set of objects would be defined to represent the new VIF types. It is expected that the result of the 'obj_name()' API call (defined by oslo VersionedObject base class) will be used as the VIF type name. This gives clear namespace separation from legacy VIF type names. class VIFConfigBridge(VIFConfig): fields = { # Name of the host TAP device used as the VIF devname: StringField(nullable=True) # Name of the bridge device to attach VIF to bridgename: StringField() } class VIFConfigEthernet(VIFConfig): fields = { # Name of the host TAP device used as the VIF devname: StringField(nullable=True) } class VIFConfigOVS(VIFConfigBridge): fields = { # OVS interface ID interfaceid: StringField() } class VIFConfigDirect(VIFConfig): fields = { # Source device NIC name on host (eg eth0) devname: StringField() } class VIFConfigVHostUser(VIFConfig): fields = { # UNIX socket path path: StringField() # Access permission mode mode: StringField() } class VIFConfigHostDevice(VIFConfig): fields = { # Host device PCI address devaddr: PCIAddressField() # VLAN number vlan: IntegerField() } These subclasses above, approximately map to the finite set of libvirt XML configs defined http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsNICS Some of these will be applicable to other hypervisors too, but there may be a few more vmware/hypervisor/xenapi specific config subclasses needed too. This spec does not attempt to enumerate what those will be, but they will be similarly simple and finite set. As aluded to in an earlier paragraph, the library will also need to define an interface for enabling the plug / unplug actions to be performed. This is a quite straightforward abstract python classs class VIFPlug(object): def plug(self, config): raise NotImpementedError() def unplug(self, config): raise NotImpementedError() The 'config' parameter passed in here will be an instance of the VIFConfig versioned object defined above. There will be one subclass of this VIFPlug class provided by each Neutron vendor mechanism. These subclass implementations do not need to be part of the os-vif library itself. The mechanism vendors would be expected to distribute them independantly, so decomposition of the neutron development is maintained. The vendors would not be permitted to define new VIFConfig sub-classes, these would remain under control of the os-vif library maintainers (ie Neuton and Nova teams), as any additions to data passed over the REST API must be reviewed and approved by project maintainers. So when a vendor wishes to create a new mechanism, they first decide which VIFConfig implementation(s) they need to target, and populate that with the required information about their VIF. This information is sufficient for the Nova hypervisor driver to config the guest virtual machine. When instantiating the VIFConfig impl, the Neutron vendor will set the 'plug' attribute to refer to the name of the VIFPlug subclass they have implemented with their vendor specific logic. The vendor VIFPlug subclasses must of course be installed on the Nova compute nodes, so Nova can load them. When Nova asks Neutron to create the VIF, neutron returns the serialized VIFConfig class, which Nova loads. Nova compute manager passes this down to the virt driver implementation, which instantiates the class defined by the 'plug' attribute. It will then invoke either the 'plug' or 'unplug' method depending on whether it is attaching or detaching a VIF to the guest instance. The hypervisor driver will then configure the guest virtual machine using the data stored in the VIFConfig class. When a new Nova talks to an old Neutron, it will obviously be receiving the port binding data in the existing dict format. Nova will have to have some compatibility code to be able to support comsumption of the data in this format. Nova would likely convert the dict on the fly to the new object model. The existing libvirt driver VIF plug/unplug methods would also need to be turned into VIFPlug subclasses. This way new Nova will be able to deal with all pre-existing VIF types that old Neutron knows about, with no loss in functionality. When an old Nova talks to a new Neutron, Neutron will have to return the data in the existing legacy port binding format. For this to work, there needs to be a negotiation between Nova and Neutron to opt-in to use of the new VIFConfig object model. With an explicit opt-in required, when an old Nova talks to new Neutron, Neutron will know to return data in the legacy format that Nova can still understand. The obvious implication of this is that any newly developer Neutron mechanisms that rely on the new VIFCOnfig object model exclusively, will not work with legacy Nova deployments. This is not considered to be a signficant problem, as the mis-match in Neutron/Nova versions is only a temporary problem as a cloud undergoes a staged update from Kilo to Liberty Alternatives ------------ 1. Do nothing. Continue with the current approach where every new Neutron mechanism requires a change to Nova hypervisor VIF driver to support its vendor specific plug/unplug actions. This will make no one happy. 2. Return to the previous approach, where Nova allows loading of out of tree VIF driver plugins for libvirt. This is undesirable for a number of reasons. The task of configuring a libvirt guests consists of two halves commonly referred to as backend configuration (ie the host) and frontend configuration (ie what the guest sees). The frontend config is something that the libvirt driver needs to retain direct control over, in order to support various features that are common to all VIFs regardless of backend config. In addition the libvirt driver has a set of classes for representing the libvirt XML config of a guest, which need to be capable of representing any VIF config for the guest. These are considered part of the libvirt internal implementation and not a stable API. Thirdly, the libvirt VIR driver plugin API has changed in the past and may change again in the future, and the data passed into it is an ill-defined dict of values from the port binding. For these reasons there is a strong desire to not hand off the entire implementation of the current libvirt VIF driver class to an external 3rd party. That all said, this spec does in fact take things back to something that is pretty similar to this previous approach. The key differences and benefits of this spec, are that it defines a set of versioned objects to hold the data that is passed to the 3rd party VIFPlug implementation. The external VIFPlug implementation is only being responsible for the host OS setup tasks - ie the plug/unplug actions. The libvirt driver retains control over guest configuration The VIFPlug driver is isolated from the internal impl and API design of the libvirt hypervisor driver. The commonality is that the Neutron vendor has the ability to retain control of their plug/unplug tasks without Nova getting in the way. 3. Keep the current VIF binding approach, but include the name of an executable program (script) that Nova will invoke to perform thte plug/unplug actions. This is approximately same as the proposal in this spec, it is just substituting in-process execution of python code, for out of process execution of a (shell) script. In the case of scripts, the data from the VIF port bindings must be provided to the script, and the proposal was to use environment variables. This is moderately ok if the data is all scalar, but if there is as need to provide non-scalar structured data like dicts/lists, then the environment variable approach is very painful to work with. The VIF script approach also involves creation of some formal versioned objects for representing port binding data, but those objects live inside Nova. Since Neutron has the same need to represent the VIF port binding data, it is considered better if we can have an external python module which defines the versioned objects to represent the port binding data, that can be shared between both Nova and Neutron It is believe that by defining a formal set of versioned objects to represent the VIF port binding data, and a python abstract class for the plug/unplug actions, we achieve a strict, clean and easily extensible interface for the boudnary between Nova and Neutron, avoiding some of the problems inherant in serializing the data via environment variables. ie the VIFPlug subclasses will stil get to access the well defined VIFConfig class attributes, instead of having to parse environment variables. Data model impact ----------------- There is no change to the database data model. There will however be creation of a number of versioned objects to represent the port binding data for each VIF type. REST API impact --------------- The data that Neutron passes back to Nova when asked to create a VIF will change in format. Assuming new Nova indicates to Neutron that it wishes to opt-in to the new format, then Neutron will return the results of running jsons.dumps(cfg.obj_to_primitive()) where cfg is the VIFConfig versioned object. This JSON data is thus formally specified and versioned, improving ability to evolve this in future releases. Security impact --------------- The external VIFPlug classes provided by vendors will be able to run arbitrary code on the compute nodes. This is little different in security risk than the current situation where the libvirt VIF driver plug/unplug method implementations run a fairly arbitrary set of commands on the compute host. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- When deploying new Neutron mechanisms, they will include a python module which must be deployed on each compute host. This provides the host OS plug/unplug logic that will be run when adding VIFs to a guest. It is anticipated that the various vendor tools for deploying openstack will be able to automate this extra requirement, so cloud admins will not be appreciably impacted by this. Developer impact ---------------- When QEMU/libvirt (or another hypervisor) invents a new way of configuring virtual machine networking, it may be neccessary to define a new versioned object in the os-vif library that is shared between Neutron and Nova. This will involve defining a subclass of VIFConfig, and then implementing the logic in the Nova libvirt driver to handle this new configuration type. Based on historical frequency of such additions in QEMU, it is expected that this will be a rare occurrance. When a vendor wishes to implement a new Neutron mechanism, they will have to provide an implementation of the VIFPlug clas whose abstract interface is define in the os-vif library. This vendor specific implementation will not need to be included in the os-vif library itself - it can be distributed and deployed by the vendor themselves. This frees the vendor from having to do a lock-step update to Nova to support their product. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: TBD Other contributors: Daniel Berrange <berrange@redhat.com> irc:danpb Brent Eagles <beagles@redhat.com> irc: beagles Work Items ---------- 1. Create a new os-vif python module in openstack and/or stackforge 2. Implement the VIFConfig abstract base class as a versioned object using olso.versionedobjects. 3. Agree on and define the minimal set of VIF configurations that need to be supported. This is approximately equal to the number of different libvirt XML configs, plus/minus a few for other hypervisors 4. Create VIFConfig subclasses for each of the configs identified in step 3. 5. Define the VIFPlug abstract base class for Neutron mechanism vendors to implement 6. Extend Neutron such that it is able to ask mechansisms to return VIF port data in either the legacy dict format or as a VIFConfig object instance 7. Extend Nova/Neutron REST inteface so that Nova is able to request use of the VIFConfig data format 8. Add code to Nova to convert the legacy dict format into the new style VIFConfig object format, for back compat with old Neutron 9. Convert the Neutron mechanisms to be able to use the new VIFConfig object model 10. Profit Dependencies ============ The key dependancy is to have collaboration between the Nova and Neutron teams in setting up the new os-vif python project, and defining the VIFConfig object model and VIFPlug interface. There is also a dependancy in agreeing how to extend the REST API in Neutron to allow Nova to request use of the new data format. This is discussed in more detail in: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/190917/ Though some aspects of that might need updating to take account of the proposals in this spec Once those are done, the Nova and Neutron teams can progress on their respective work items independantly. Testing ======= The current gate CI system includes cover for some of the Neutron mechanisms. As and when both Neutron and Nova support the new design, the current CI system will automatically start to test its operation. For Neutron mechanisms that are not covered by current CI, it is expected that the respective vendors take on the task of testing their own implementations. Documentation Impact ==================== The primary documentation impact is not user facing. The docs required will all be developer facing, so can be done as simple docs inside the respective python projects. There may be some specific release notes required to advise cloud admins of any considerations during upgrade, but this should be minimal References ========== The alternative proposal to introduce a VIF script to the existing VIF port binding data: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/162468/ The alternative proposal to completely outsource hyervisor VIF driver plugins to 3rd parties once again: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/191210/ The proposal to add a negotiation between Neuton and Nova for vif port binding types. https://review.openstack.org/#/c/190917/ History ======= .. list-table:: Revisions :header-rows: 1 * - Release Name - Description * - Liberty - Introduced ",,527,0

Problem description =================== As of now a group is created/enable via adding it as a pool attribute while creating/updating a pool. If admin/operator want to add a pool to an appropriate group depending on the capabilities of the storage attached to the pool. He has to first check if a desire group already exists in the environment. 1. There is no method to get the list of all group present in the env. 2. If admin/operator wants to rename/delete a group, there is no method for the group delete/update operation. As of now, group name is optional while creating a pool, So user can create pools with out attaching it to any group, later it may possible user wants to attached those pools to a group. 3. There is no way to attached multiple pools(having same capabilities) to a group in a single operation. 4. Similarly, no way to detached pools from a group. Proposed change =============== As of now pool<-->group mapping is like: pool1 ---> group1 pool2 ---> group1 pool3 ---> group2 - pooln ---> group1 poolm ---> group2 It will be very optimized if we can make group a standalone logical entity. We have to create new API for group related operations. group <--> pool mapping should be like group1 <---> {pool1, pool2,....pooln} group2 <---> {pool3, pool4,.....poolm} ""group"" APIs -------------- 1. Create a group: Template PUT /v2/groups { ... } Request PUT /v2/groups HTTP/1.1 Host: marconi.example.com { ""name"": {group_name} ""metadata"": {} ""desc"": """" } Response HTTP/1.1 201 Created Location: https://marconi.example.com/v2/groups/group1 { ""name"": {group_name} } 2. GET a group info: Template GET /v2/groups/{group_name} Request GET /v2/groups/group1 HTTP/1.1 Host: zaqar.example.com Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Location: /v2/groups/group1 { ""name"": {group_name} ""metadata"": {} ""desc"": """" ""capabilities"": {""FIFO"", ""CLAIMS"", ""DURABILITY"", ""AOD"", ""HIGH_THROUGHPUT""} ""pools"": {""pool1"", ""pool4"", ""pool10""} } 3. List groups: Template GET /v2/groups?detailed=True Request GET /v2/groups HTTP/1.1 Host: zaqar.proxy.example.com Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Location: /v2/groups { ""links"": [ { ""rel"": ""next"", ""href"": ""/v2/groups"" ], ""groups"":[ {""href"": ""/v2/groups/group1"", ""name"":""group1"", ""capabilities"": {""FIFO"", ""CLAIMS"", ""DURABILITY"", ""AOD"", ""HIGH_THROUGHPUT""}}, {""href"": ""/v2/groups/group2"", ""name"":""grup2"", ""capabilities"": {FIFO"", ""CLAIMS"", ""DURABILITY"", ""AOD""}} ] } Note: if detailed=True is mentioned in request, ""pools"", ""desc"" and ""metadata"" information also be displayed corresponding to each group. or if no group exist: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Location: /v2/groups { ""links"": [ { ""rel"": ""next"", ""href"": ""/v2/groups?detailed=True"" ], ""groups"":[] } 4. Register pools to the group Template PUT /v2/groups/{group_name}/add Request PUT /v2/groups/group1/add HTTP/1.1 Host: marconi.example.com { ""pools"": {""pool1"", ""pool2""} } Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK content-length: 0 5. De-register pools from a group Template DELETE /v2/groups/{group_name}/remove Request DELETE /v2/groups/group1/remove HTTP/1.1 Host: marconi.example.com { ""pools"": {""pool1"", ""pool2""} } Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK content-length: 0 6. Delete a group Template DELETE /v2/groups/{group-name} Request DELETE /v2/groups/group1 HTTP/1.1 Host: zaqar.example.com Response HTTP/1.1 204 No Content Note: Before deleting a group, It is necessary that no pool should attached to that group. 7. Update a group Template PATCH /v2/groups/{group-name} Request PATCH /v2/groups/group1 HTTP/1.1 Host: zaqar.example.com { ""name"": {group_name} ""metadata"": {} ""desc"" : """" } Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK Other Notes ----------- 1. In the case of pre-signed URLs, the queue cannot be created lazily. This is to prevent cases where queues are deleted and users still have a valid URL. This is not a big issues in cases where there's just 1 pool. However, if there's a deployment using more than 1 type of pool, the lazily created queue may end up in an undesired pool and it'd be possible for an attacker to try a DoS on that pool. Therefore, whenever a pre-signed URL is created, if a pool doesn't exist, one will be created. 2. I'm not a fan of passing the `project-id` around but I can't think of another way to do this and still have the ability to preserve multi-tenancy without passing the project. 3. I don't like having the key set in the config file. In future versions, we could think of making this information part of the queue itself. The reason we can't do that right now is because we don't have private fields in the metadata. It should be easy enough to do it as an enhancement for this feature. 4. As a future enhancement, we could also use Barbican for key management. Drawbacks --------- 1. If a user mentioned a group name while creating a pool. then the group is automatically created if not already exists. 2. Capability should be a group property, all pools in a group must have the same capabilities. Capabilities will added to a group dynamically, when a first pool register to the group. TBD Alternatives ------------ solution for prob1: Have to scan all pool available in the env and have to check group attribute for all pools. Solution for prob2: Have to filter out pools whose group attribute match to the desire group and then update the group attribute. However these are not an effective solutions. No alternate solution for prob3 and prob4. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: mdnadeem Work Items ---------- 1. write a module group.py for group related operation for all supported storage backend 2. have to write code for group data base schema. 3.

Problem description =================== The existing upgrade content in the Operations Guide includes rigid step-by-step procedures that rely on the simple installation guide architecture and upstream distribution packages. Our audience of operators deploy OpenStack in a variety of ways and would benefit from more generic procedures that apply more easily to different environments.

For example, address mandatory operational or configuration changes, stop the service, upgrade the code, upgrade the database schema, start the service, verify operation of the service. * Mandatory or significant operational or configuration changes between releases. * Links to release notes and configuration reference for other changes. Mandatory or significant operational or configuration changes between releases only consider upgrades from N-1 to N release back to the most recent EOL release. Given time constraints, development prioritizes upgrades between more recent releases. Alternatives ------------ Continue using the existing content, likely without updates for recent releases.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Cassandra based storage driver ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/cassandra-driver Cassandra is a distributed data-store that is AP in the CAP trade-off. As such it is very well suited to metric storage. This project adds support for storing data in Cassandra, just like we currently support HBase, SQL, MongoDB et al. Problem description =================== Cassandra is well-suited to storing metrics at large scale; by adding support for it to Ceilometer, it should be able to scale to bigger data sizes than is possible with non-distributed systems, and to higher throughput than is possible with a consistent (in the CAP sense) system. In addition, Cassandra can operate across multiple datacenters, so we may be able to enable geo-replication fault-tolerance. Proposed change =============== This change will add Cassandra drivers to Ceilometer for samples, events and alarms. Alternatives ------------ HBase is a good scalable alternative to Cassandra. In CAP, HBase is more C, and Cassandra is AP, so they are at different points in the design space. Cassandra is also easy to configure and maintain compared to other distributed datastore options. I do not expect everyone to use the Cassandra driver, but I expect some people will want to, and we can offer them that option without interfering with the desires of operators that do not configure the Cassandra driver. Data model impact ----------------- The Cassandra driver uses a different data schema on disk, optimized for the unique requirements ('wide rows are better') and the consistency characteristics ('last write wins') of Cassandra. However, the external data model should not change due to the effort. Migration from existing datastores will not be supported. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- The Cassandra backend should be appropriately protected, just like any other datastore. Pipeline impact --------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance/Scalability Impacts ------------------------------- Cassandra is believed to be more scalable than some other options, but there should otherwise be no impact. There will not impact on users that do not choose to configure the Cassandra backend. Other deployer impact --------------------- The driver will initially support at least the same options as the HBase driver. A new storage URL schema, 'cassandra' will be added that will enable a cassandra backend, as with all the other drivers. Users must opt-in to this option, so merging it is low-risk. We are adding a dependency on the cassandra-driver for python (Apache 2). This has been accepted into the openstack-requirements project. It would only be required if cassandra backends are enabled. Developer impact ---------------- Another storage driver will require maintenance. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: justin-fathomdb Other contributors: None Ongoing maintainer: justin-fathomdb Work Items ---------- Initial implementation has already been submitted in Gerrit. A lot of the code is actually code not necessarily specific to Ceilometer: in particular a Cassandra 'ORM' type layer, and an adapter for eventlet. Based on discussions during the code review process, this isn't a great long-term solution, though it might be that the code has to be in Ceilometer initially. We will try to get the eventlet adapter into the upstream Cassandra driver. We will start the ORM layer where we need it in the Ceilometer code, but likely move it into Oslo as it is used in multiple OpenStack projects. Hopefully we can add Cassandra support to Gnocchi soon; that will likely be the second OpenStack project using the Cassandra 'ORM' layer, which would support putting it into Oslo. Future lifecycle ================ To be maintained by justin-fathomdb. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= A mock Cassandra implementation has been added, so the unit tests are more like integration tests. We can also try to get Cassandra added to devstack, which would then support creating a new testing gate-job; for even better continuous testing. Documentation Impact ==================== We should just document the cassandra:// endpoint. It creates its own schemas etc. References ========== Interesting blog post which talks about storing metrics in Cassandra: http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/metric-collection-and-storage-with-cassandra Cassandra is often abbreviated C* ",0,176

This section describes how to work on the schema and migration scripts with just the unit test virtualenv and mysql. You can also operate on a separate test database so you don't mess up the installed Neutron database. Setting up the environment ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Install mysql service ''''''''''''''''''''' This only needs to be done once since it is a system install. If you have run devstack on your system before, then the mysql service is already installed and you can skip this step. Mysql must be configured as installed by devstack, and the following script accomplishes this without actually running devstack:: INSTALL_MYSQL_ONLY=True ./tools/configure_for_func_testing.sh ../devstack Run this from the root of the neutron repo. It assumes an up-to-date clone of the devstack repo is in ``../devstack``. Note that you must know the mysql root password. It is derived from (in order of precedence): - ``$MYSQL_PASSWORD`` in your environment - ``$MYSQL_PASSWORD`` in ``../devstack/local.conf`` - ``$MYSQL_PASSWORD`` in ``../devstack/localrc`` - default of 'secretmysql' from ``tools/configure_for_func_testing.sh`` Work on a test database ''''''''''''''''''''''' Rather than using the neutron database when working on schema and alembic migration script changes, we can work on a test database. In the examples below, we use a database named ``testdb``. To create the database:: mysql -e ""create database testdb;"" You will often need to clear it to re-run operations from a blank database:: mysql -e ""drop database testdb; create database testdb;"" To work on the test database instead of the neutron database, point to it with the ``--database-connection`` option:: neutron-db-manage --database-connection mysql+pymysql://root:secretmysql@127.0.0.1/testdb?charset=utf8 You may find it convenient to set up an alias (in your .bashrc) for this:: alias test-db-manage='neutron-db-manage --database-connection mysql+pymysql://root:secretmysql@127.0.0.1/testdb?charset=utf8' Create and activate the virtualenv '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' From the root of the neutron (or sub-project) repo directory, run:: tox --notest -r -e py27 source .tox/py27/bin/activate Now you can use the ``test-db-manage`` alias in place of ``neutron-db-manage`` in the script auto-generation instructions below. When you are done, exit the virtualenv:: deactivate This section describes how to auto-generate an alembic migration script for a model change. You may either use the system installed devstack environment, or a virtualenv + testdb environment as described in :ref:`neutron-db-manage-without-devstack`. Stop the neutron service. Work from the base directory of the neutron (or sub-project) repo. Check out the master branch and and do ``git pull`` to ensure it is fully up to date. Check out your development branch and rebase to master. **NOTE:** Make sure you have not updated the ``CONTRACT_HEAD`` or ``EXPAND_HEAD`` yet at this point. Start with an empty database and upgrade to heads:: mysql -e ""drop database neutron; create database neutron;"" neutron-db-manage upgrade heads The database schema is now created without your model changes. The alembic ``revision --autogenerate`` command will look for differences between the schema generated by the upgrade command and the schema defined by the models, including your model updates::**NOTE:** The ""description of revision"" text should be a simple English sentence. The first 30 characters of the description will be used in the file name for the script, with underscores substituted for spaces. If the truncation occurs at an awkward point in the description, you can modify the script file name manually before committing. ",::,129,10

To give some context, calling destroy [5] was added as a

was not calling destroy on catching the exception [2]. But now,
Nova compute catches all exceptions that happen during spawn

To minimize external library dependencies for Swift unit
tests and SAIO, PyECLib 1.1.1 introduces a native backend
'liberasurecode_rs_vand.'  This patch is to migrate over
the unit tests to the new ec_type when available.

This change will work with current pyeclib requirements
(==1.0.7) and also future requirements (>=1.0.7).

When we're able to raise *our* requirements to >=1.1.1 we
should remove jerasure from the list of preferred backends.
Related SAIO doc and example config changes should be
included with that patch.

This adds the CORS support middleware to Trove, allowing a deployer
to optionally configure rules under which a javascript client may
break the single-origin policy and access the API directly.

For trove, the paste.ini method of deploying the middleware was
chosen, because it needs to be able to annotate responses created
by keystonemiddleware. If the middleware were explicitly included
as in the previous patch, keystone would reject the request before
the cross-domain headers could be annotated, resulting in an
error response that was unreadable by the user agent.

copied to this package. It was in its own repository because it
requires the requests-kerberos package and we want to minimize
requirements in keystoneauth (or keystoneclient at the time the

Provides Redhat support for PgSQL and makes it easy to extend
further to support other linux variants.

Currently, config.template files for the various datastores are
rendered by the task manager and sent to the guest agent. For
databases such as PostgreSQL that may have OS-specific config
entries, the most appropriate place to render portions of the
config template is on the guest itself.

The template generated by the task manager will therefore leave
any guest-specific elements intact so that they can be rendered
in a second pass by the datastore.

Once the pgsql guest receives the template, it replaces the OS
specific entries. The same logic is also used to 'render'
previously hardcoded constants for things like the location of
the postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf files.

To accomplish this we need to abstract much of the current behavior into a driver. In this context a driver is the abstraction of certain behaviors such as configuration and health monitoring into a modular driver class. Problem Description =================== Currently the Rug is hard coded around managing router instances. A reworking of many parts of the code are required to enable the rug to orchestrate things other than neutron routers. Proposed Change =============== Identify common portions of code that should remain consistent between higher level services (routing,load balancing, vpn). Then abstract all other behavior into a new router driver. Common behaviors; * instance power state * base networking config Router driver specific behavior; * vrrp Shared behavior with different procedures; * health monitoring * interactions with neutron * configuration management Data Model Impact ----------------- N/A REST API Impact --------------- The api should remain consistent. Security Impact --------------- This change should have no impact on security. Notifications Impact -------------------- N/A Other End User Impact --------------------- N/A Performance Impact ------------------ N/A Other Deployer Impact --------------------- This change will have several more configuration options and will ultimately expand deployers options with our software. Developer Impact ---------------- N/A Community Impact ---------------- This change will open the Rug up to allow it to manage any high level service which will invite participation from across the community in ways that cannot be predicted. Alternatives ------------ At this time no viable alternatives have been suggested. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- David Lenwell - davidlenwell Work Items ---------- This is a complex change. Please forgive the following hand waving. Dependencies ============ N/A Testing ======= Many of the unit tests will require a rework. Tempest Tests ------------- Functional Tests ---------------- Should have no effect on functional tests.

Metrics can be published to the\nMonasca API, stored and queried.  Alarms can be created and notifications, such\nas email, can be sent when alarms transition state.  Support for complex event\nprocessing and logging is in progress.  Monasca builds an extensible platform\nfor advanced monitoring services that can be used by both operators and tenants\nto gain operational insight and visibilty, ensuring availabilty and stability.\n\nCurrently, Monasca is hosted in Stackforge, but will move to OpenStack.  All\ncode has been developed under an Apache 2.0 license and has no restrictions on\ndistribution or deployment.  All Monasca code is submitted and reviewed through\nOpenStack Gerrit [1].  The Monasca project maintains a core team that approves\nall changes.  Bugs are filed, reviewed  and tracked in Launchpad [10].\n\nMonasca integrates in with several OpenStack projects and services.  The Monasca\nAPI uses Keystone for authentication and multi-tenancy.  Oslo libraries are used\nby all components where applicable.  Keystone middleware is used by the Monasca\nAPI.  The Monasca project is in the process of integrating with Ceilometer by\nusing the Ceilometer data collection pipeline as well as the Ceilometer API via\na Ceilometer to Monasca storage driver, which will enable Monasca to consume\nOpenStack notifications from other OpenStack services [5].  A monitoring panel\nhas been developer for Horizon.  An integration with Heat for auto-scaling\nsupport is under active development.\n\nMonasca has been running weekly meetings from the start of the project.\nMeetings are held on Tuesday's at 9:00 AM MST and are open to anyone that wants\nto attend.  Currently, the Monasca PTL is Roland Hochmuth.  Regular elections\nwill be held to elect new PTLs and core members.\n\nMonasca was initially discussed at the Atlanta Summit.  The first Monasca\nmid-cycle meetup was held in August 2014 at which three companies attended.  At\nthe Paris Summit a session on Monsca was held.  In addition, at the Paris\nSummit, there as a design summit session held to discuss areas for collaboration\nbetween Ceilometer and Monasca.  A Monasca Liberty mid-cycle meetup was held on\nAugust 7-8, 2015, and included six companies [9].  Monasca is planning on\nholding Monasca specific sessions at the Tokyo Summit as well as joint sessions\nwith other OpenStack projects.  Monasca is interested in developing integrations\nwith Ceilometer, Heat, Mistral, Congress and others.  There have been several\nlocal meetups on Monasca in 2015, including Austin, TX, Boulder, CO, and San\nFrancisco, CA.\n\nMonasca has an extensive set of documentation.  Overall documentation and links\nto documentation are at the Monasca Wiki [2].  The Monasca API is documented\n[3].  The optional Monasca Agent is documented [4].\n\nMonasca has several official deployment solutions available.  Ansible roles are\navailable [6].  Puppet modules  are available via the openstack organization\n[7].  Monasca also has a turn-key development environment based on Vagrant,\nDevstack and Ansible [8].\n\nMonasca is continually deployed to test and production environments off of\nmaster branch and maintains a very high level of quality.

Monasca provides a multi-tenant, highly scalable, performant, fault-tolerant
monitoring-as-a-service solution for metrics.  Metrics can be published to the
Monasca API, stored and queried.  Alarms can be created and notifications, such
as email, can be sent when alarms transition state.  Support for complex event
processing and logging is in progress.  Monasca builds an extensible platform
for advanced monitoring services that can be used by both operators and tenants
to gain operational insight and visibilty, ensuring availabilty and stability.

All code has been developed under an Apache 2.0 license and has no restrictions
on distribution or deployment.  All Monasca code is submitted and reviewed
through OpenStack Gerrit [1].  The Monasca project maintains a core team that
approves all changes.  Bugs are filed, reviewed  and tracked in Launchpad [10].

Monasca integrates in with several OpenStack projects and services.  The Monasca
API uses Keystone for authentication and multi-tenancy.  Oslo libraries are used
by all components where applicable.  Keystone middleware is used by the Monasca
API.  The Monasca project is in the process of integrating with Ceilometer by
using the Ceilometer data collection pipeline as well as the Ceilometer API via
a Ceilometer to Monasca storage driver, which will enable Monasca to consume
OpenStack notifications from other OpenStack services [5].  A monitoring panel
has been developer for Horizon.  An integration with Heat for auto-scaling
support is under active development.

Monasca has been running weekly meetings from the start of the project.
Meetings are held on Tuesday's at 9:00 AM MST and are open to anyone that wants
to attend.  Currently, the Monasca PTL is Roland Hochmuth.  Regular elections
will be held to elect new PTLs and core members.

Monasca was initially discussed at the Atlanta Summit.  The first Monasca
mid-cycle meetup was held in August 2014 at which three companies attended.  At
the Paris Summit a session on Monsca was held.  In addition, at the Paris
Summit, there as a design summit session held to discuss areas for collaboration
between Ceilometer and Monasca.  A Monasca Liberty mid-cycle meetup was held on
August 7-8, 2015, and included six companies [9].  Monasca is planning on
holding Monasca specific sessions at the Tokyo Summit as well as joint sessions
with other OpenStack projects.  Monasca is interested in developing integrations
with Ceilometer, Heat, Mistral, Congress and others.  There have been several
local meetups on Monasca in 2015, including Austin, TX, Boulder, CO, and San
Francisco, CA.

Monasca has an extensive set of documentation.  Overall documentation and links
to documentation are at the Monasca Wiki [2].  The Monasca API is documented
[3].  The optional Monasca Agent is documented [4].

Monasca has several official deployment solutions available.  Ansible roles are
available [6].  Puppet modules  are available via the openstack organization
[7].  Monasca also has a turn-key development environment based on Vagrant,
Devstack and Ansible [8]. Monasca integrates with DevStack via a Monasca
plugin [11] for DevStack. Tempest tests for Monasca [12] are also available.

Monasca is continually deployed to test and production environments off of
master branch and maintains a very high level of quality.  The first major
release of Monasca was tagged for Kilo.  The second major release of Monasca
will be tagged for Liberty.

This is a request to add Senlin [1] to the Big Tent.

Senlin is designed to be a generic clustering service for OpenStack clouds
that makes the creation and management of homogeneous objects as groups an
easier task. Examples of objects include Heat stacks, Nova servers, etc.
Senlin provides an open framework that consists of:

 - an engine that manages clusters and nodes and the primitives to operate
   them as abstract objects;
 - profile plugins that enable senlin to talk to a specific OpenStack
   service for object CRUD operations.
 - policy plugins that capture rule sets which are checked/enforced when
   object operations are performed, e.g. placement, deletion, scaling, health
   and others.
 - trigger plugins that customize the external signals/alarms/events that can
   trigger operations on clusters/objects/profiles/policies;

The project was started in Nov, 2014 after the Paris summit as a standalone
service that will offload the auto-scaling service from Heat. The scope was
then expanded to include other policies for a comprehensive clustering or
collection service on OpenStack. The project was openly discussed with the Heat
team during Vancouver summit. Plan is being developed for migrating the
existing auto-scaling support in a way that reduce (or totally avoid) user land
changes.

Senlin is also working with other OpenStack projects to explore collaboration
opportunities. For example, team has worked with intern students to manage
container clusters under the Magnum context. The goal is to investigate how to
manage the VM groups and container clusters so that these two layers can be
scaled, load-balanced in accordance with each other. A demo is scheduled on
the Tokyo summit.

Senlin strictly follows the ""4 opens"" principle of the community.
The project is fully licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. All code changes
are submitted and reviewed using the OpenStack infrastructure and gated
through gerrit[2][3][4]. Team has been using the +2/+A process for patch
reviews. The current unit test coverage is 90% and functional gate is in place
helping ensure everything works together. The project strictly obeys the
coordinated project interfaces, including tox, pbr, global-requirements etc.
All dependencies of the project falls within the range of global requirements.
The gating now runs pep8, py27, py34, docs tasks and optionally a functional
test.

The PTL was chosen by election to be Qiming Teng during Mitaka cycle. The PTL
serves as liason between the Senlin community and other projects to coordinate
the interactions with for example python-openstacksdk, heat, ceilometer, etc.
Team plans to excercise a PTL rotation among core contributors.

Project team has been using openstack-dev mailing list and freenode IRC
channel #senlin heavily for cooperation. The #senlin channel is logged [5] and
the logging is notified in the channel. Project team has weekly IRC meeting on
channel #openstack-meeting on 1300 UTC every Tuesday [6] to accommodate
contributors from east Asia and America.

Senlin has a well-documented, reasonably stable API [7] ready to be merged by
upstream project. It has documents for beginner users [8] and new developers
[9]. Developer team has been answering questions related to installation and/or
usage in IRC actively.

It is true that Senlin has been initiated by a single company but the project
has now attracted contributors from more than 6 affiliations. We have reasons
to believe the adoption by Big Tent will help encourage more contributions to
its design and implementation, thus improve the diversity status of the team.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Health Check API ========================================== Health check API to support either passive or active High Availability (HA). Problem description =================== The health check APIs allows other services to perform monitoring, load balancing and ensuring High Availability (HA) of Ceilometer. High Availability for the Ceilometer APIs service is ensured running more than one instance on different physical or virtual machines. The HA can be either passive or active, meaning that either one copy or multiple copies receive and handle traffic. These strategies are performed by a Load Balancer (LB) and are outside the scope of this blueprint. The issue the blueprint is addressing is that without a mechanism for the LB to verify that the service is still reachable and functional it is impossible to scale it to HA levels. Proposed change =============== The proposed change is to introduce a specific V2 API for health check. The API will support shallow and deep check. The shallow check only ensures that the service is running, but all the dependencies with its back-ends are not tested. This ensures the request to be fast (typically below the 50ms) for the LB to request on a fixed and frequent interval. The deep check requires the extra step of performing a full round-trip to the database and retrieve (or validate consistency) of some of the tables and data. This second method is used to verify that the service not only is alive but it can perform all the expected operations. This latter function can be used in conjunction with data coming from monitoring. When some database instances are reporting problems the LB can perform deep check to verify that this particular service is not affected. Alternatives ------------ The API is designed to be flexible and can be positioned before or after authentication and authorization. These two scenarios are valid for different reasons: * Unauthorized: this means that there are fewer requests to Keystone for validations since the check is performed by a trusted service and it is not gathering real data * Authorized: this means that a special user is used by the LB to perform the health check request. This will take longer but it will validate that the requester is indeed the expected service (i.e. LB or MONaaS). Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- The new API is v2/health and supports both the HEAD and GET HTTP verbs. The proposed API has the following URI and response codes: * `HEAD /v2/health`:: -> <- 204 No Content In case the service cannot be reach a 5xx will be returned. * `GET /v2/health`:: -> <- 200 OK In case the service cannot be reach a 5xx will be returned and in case the back-end cannot be inquired a 503 will be returned. Security impact --------------- Usual Keystone token-based authN and RBAC-based authZ if the API is inserted after authorization. No authN if inserted before in the WSGI pipeline. Pipeline impact --------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- No other impact beside the API changes. Performance/Scalability Impacts ------------------------------- Describe any potential performance or scaling impact on the system, considering for example: * The volume of new metering data generated, and the knock-on impact of this on the latency of the publication conduit and database dispatch layer. * Whether any new data retention policies are required. * How any new APIs and/or storage driver methods will perform when scaled over very large datasets. * Whether any explicit performance testing would be advisable to validate the new feature, either at the PoC stage, and/or in its final form. Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: fabgia Other contributors: fabgia Ongoing maintainer: fabgia Work Items ---------- TBD Future lifecycle ================ Porting to V3 if necessary.

Sane defaults for new configuration variables are provided in such a way that deployed code from N can be expected to run without operator intervention. * Database schema updates are stable and ordered such that moving a database (with actual data in it) from release N-1 to N is possible without data loss. This must be actively tested full-stack on every proposed commit in the gate, with resources present and working before and after the upgrade step. * A procedure for general upgrades of the project is defined and does not change substantially from cycle to cycle. * The project provides an upgrade impact section on the release notes page that highlights anything that must be done by operators for each cycle outside the normal upgrade procedures.

Mission and Vision:
To provide tools for managing backup/restore and disaster recovery.
Full version available here [0].

The temporary PTL is Fausto Marzi.
Starting from April a new PTL will be elected by using the standard
OpenStack mechanism and timeline [1]

The #openstack-freezer IRC channel on freenode is logged and the channel is
notified of such logging [2]. Our public meeting logs are stored [3].

Many design aspect has been defined at the Vancouver Summit [4].

The project uses public code reviews on the OpenStack infrastructure.
A part the first 2-3 months of the project creation,
Freezer has been using the +2/+A process requiring two unique core
reviewers to review a patch.

Our gating runs pep8, pylint and other unittest and integration tests.
In the last weeks a Devstack plugin was also implemented [5].

Currently there is a dedicated Team working on Freezer from one
of the top 3 Company contributors in OpenStack. There are also
external contributors to the project [6].

As this is a new project the number of contributors is not huge,
but there is a strong interest everywhere and the feedback from
the community was always positive and encouraging.

Freezer uses IRC and OpenStack related ML for all the communications.

We are doing all our best to make this project useful and successfull
for the whole OpenStack Community.

Five functional tests rely on swift test account4 being
properly configured in keystone (the tests are already
skipped with tempauth). A regression in devstack appears
to have caused account4 to not be correctly set up which
causes those five tests to fail.

This is a tactical change to skip those tests when the auth
for account4 fails, pending devstack being fixed. Note:

- we do not just skip the tests unconditionally; on a test
  system with correctly setup keystone accounts the tests
  are still run.

- the tests only skip if the auth fails with keystone for
  account4.

In an environment where reclaim_instance_interval is set to
non-zero in nova, an delete request will only soft delete an
instance.(status=SOFT_DELETED, so that the instance can be reclaimed
if required by using 'nova restore <instance_id>')

Now in the above environment, when an delete stack is requested by
user, stack will hang until reclaim_instance_inerval or timeout.
Hence status=SOFT_DELETED for an instance should be handled by heat, which
this patch proposes.

Due to a bug in cliff argument parsing, the --os-image option for
specifying a different overcloud image was not working. The fix
included avoiding the conflict along with adding the ability to add a
QCOW2 image into glance without requiring presence of the default initramfs
and kernel overcloud files. There was also a trivial addition of the
ability to set the image name in Glance, though it isn't required.

The primary use case for this is to be able to specify an atomic image
for use in the overcloud:

openstack overcloud image upload --os-image-file \
Fedora-Cloud-Atomic-22-20150521.x86_64.qcow2 --os-image-name \
fedora-atomic

As far as the old intended (but non-working) behavior of changing the
overcloud image name goes, one can still set the OS_IMAGE environment
variable to override the default 'overcloud-full.qcow2'.

This step requires a few pieces of information that can be found by querying various OpenStack services. Create a file named ``my_cluster_create.json`` with the following content: ""name"": ""my-cluster-1"", ""hadoop_version"": ""<plugin_version>"", ""cluster_template_id"" : ""74add4df-07c2-4053-931f-d5844712727f"", ""user_keypair_id"": ""my_stack"", ""default_image_id"": ""c119f99c-67f2-4404-9cff-f30e4b185036"",The parameter ``user_keypair_id`` with the value ``my_stack`` is generated by $ nova keypair-add my_stack --pub-key $PATH_TO_PUBLIC_KEY``my_cluster_create.json``. If your environment does not use neutron, you can omit ""neutron_management_network"" above. You can determine the neutron network id with the following command: $ neutron net-list $ sahara cluster-create --json my_cluster_create.json | status | Active | | neutron_management_network | None |

A recent commit in devstack (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/219207 )
now validates that all post-processed conf files specified in local.conf
exist.

We need to conditionally add the ceilometer.conf to this file, since it
may or may not be present.

Enabling Ceilometer was also broken, as it's now a member of the 'big
tent' so this was fixed as well

Two additional options were added to enable ceilometer notifications in
Nova and Cinder.  These can be activated by setting the following on
the command line or in options.rc (or ~/.redstack.options.rc).

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================================================== Support for multi-rack deployment with static routes ==================================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/l3-multiple-racks Fuel should allow user to deploy Fuel to multiple racks with a scalable underlay network design so that the user can meet his or her expanding business needs without having to re-deploy/migrate workloads. -------------------- Problem description -------------------- Current implementation of multi-rack support lacks a number of features in demand (all services via one network, networks shared between node network groups, VIPs can be allocated in different node network groups, arbitrary VIP addresses), and has a number of usability issues (manual setup of dnsmasq on master node, lack of validation, nodes do not have connection with node network groups until they are added into environment but in fact they have IPs from different node network groups, new routes are not applied when node network group is added to the deployed environment). Current proposal deals with the issues listed above. ---------------- Proposed changes ---------------- 1. Make additional setup of dnsmasq on master node when node network groups are configured. User should do that by hands now. It should be done automatically when parameters of any of Admin networks are changed or Admin network is deleted. This will save a user from manual error-prone operations of setting this up via a command line. 2. Validation of provided node network groups configuration is done on backend. Validation is very simple now, it is done for a limited number of cases. 3. Assignment of VIP for network managed by dhcp. It is about 'admin' network now. When some network role that requires VIP is mapped there, IP address should be reserved via dnsmasq. This can be done as a separate task or as a predeployment hook. This solves all-in-one network problem. 4. When a new node network group is added to the deployed environment new routes should be applied to network configuration of all nodes. This will resolve an issue with adding node network groups to the deployed environment. 5. VIP allocation is restricted to controller node group now in Nailgun. It should be allowed to allocate VIP in any node group to allow proper separation of HA services into different nodes. But other restriction remains the same: VIP can be allocated only if all nodes which conform to its node_roles section are in the same node group. 6. Node network groups are moved out from environment. Node network groups will be managed independently from environments. This will provide more consistent UX where user will have bootstrap nodes grouped by Admin networks before nodes are added into any environment. Networks' parameters and nodes data can be checked for consistency on early stages. Also, configuration of Admin networks and corresponding dnsmasq setup can be made prior to creation of environments. But DB relations become more complicated in this case if we allow using of the same node network group in different environments. 7. Provide an ability to share network (L2/L3 parameters) between several node network groups. As for now, each particular node network group have its own L2/L3 parameters for every network. It is 1:1 mapping. It will be possible to share arbitrary networks (use shared L2/L3 parameters) between several node network groups. It will be possible to use completely arbitrary mapping via API (may be CLI as well) and UI will support two options: share particular network among all node network groups within environment or create separate network (L2/L3 parameters) for every node network group. E.g. this ability is required to use a dedicated storage. 8. It should be allowed to set user-defined IP for any VIP. This IP can even be out of any environment's networks, to be managed by external means (e.g. external LB). Web UI ====== GUI tasks are to be in separate ticket/spec. Nailgun ======= A number of tasks will be added to serve auto setup of dnsmasq on master node, IP reservation for VIP on DHCP network. DB relations will be changed for tasks 6 and 7. REST API will be changed for tasks 6, 7 and 8. Data model ---------- TBD REST API -------- TBD Orchestration ============= TBD RPC Protocol ------------ TBD Fuel Client =========== TBD Plugins ======= None Fuel Library ============ TBD ------------ Alternatives ------------ This feature can be treated as a composition of several smaller changes. Seems, all of them can be implemented separately. But implementation of tasks 6 and 7 is dependent one from another. -------------- Upgrade impact -------------- N/A --------------- Security impact --------------- N/A -------------------- Notifications impact -------------------- TBD --------------- End user impact --------------- TBD ------------------ Performance impact ------------------ N/A ----------------- Deployment impact ----------------- Discuss things that will affect how you deploy and configure Fuel that have not already been mentioned, such as: * What configuration options are being added? Should they be more generic than proposed? Are the default values ones which will work well in real deployments? * Is this a change that takes immediate effect after its merged, or is it something that has to be explicitly enabled? * If this change is a new binary, how would it be deployed? * Please state anything that those doing continuous deployment, or those upgrading from the previous release, need to be aware of. Also describe any plans to deprecate configuration values or features. For example, if a directory with instances changes its name, how are instance directories created before the change handled? Are they get moved them? Is there a special case in the code? Is it assumed that operators will recreate all the instances in their cloud? ---------------- Developer impact ---------------- None -------------------------------- Infrastructure/operations impact -------------------------------- Explain what changes in project infrastructure will be required to support the proposed change. Consider the following: * Will it increase the load on CI infrastructure by making build or test jobs consume more CPU, network, or storage capacity? Will it increase the number of scheduled jobs? * Will it require new work-flows or changes in existing work-flows implemented in CI, packaging, source code management, code review, or software artifact publishing tools? * Will it require new or upgraded tools or services to be deployed on project infrastructure? * Will it require new types of Jenkins jobs? * Will it affect git branch management strategies? * Will it introduce new release artifacts? * Will it require changes in build environments of any existing CI jobs? Would such changes be backwards compatible with previous Fuel releases currently supported by project infrastructure? -------------------- Documentation impact -------------------- What is the impact on the docs team of this change? Some changes might require donating resources to the docs team to have the documentation updated. Don't repeat details discussed above, but please reference them here. -------------------- Expected OSCI impact -------------------- Expected and known impact to OSCI should be described here. Please mention whether: * There are new packages that should be added to the mirror * Version for some packages should be changed * Some changes to the mirror itself are required -------------- Implementation -------------- Assignee(s) =========== Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: <launchpad-id or None> Other contributors: <launchpad-id or None> Mandatory design review: <launchpad-id or None> Work Items ========== Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Dependencies ============ * Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in fuel, or in other projects, that this one either depends on or is related to. * If this requires functionality of another project that is not currently used by Fuel, document that fact. * Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not included in Fuel? Or does it depend on a specific version of library? ------------ Testing, QA ------------ Please discuss how the change will be tested. It is assumed that unit test coverage will be added so that doesn't need to be mentioned explicitly. If there are firm reasons not to add any other tests, please indicate them. Acceptance criteria =================== Please specify clearly defined acceptance criteria for proposed changes. ---------- References ---------- Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any reference. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are: * Links to mailing list or IRC discussions * Links to relevant research, if appropriate * Related specifications as appropriate * Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to ",,329,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================= Add an instance table to the api database ========================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/cells-instance-table In order to maintain the API contract when using cells we need to store enough information to fulfill an instance show request. Problem description =================== When an API request is made to build an instance there is a certain response contract that we need to honor. This means that we need to have stored certain information from the request such as image, flavor, name, uuid, etc... This data needs to be available before the scheduler has been called to pick a cell, or in the event that no cells are picked by the scheduler and the build never proceeds into a cell. Use Cases ---------- * Operators want to partition their deployments into cells for scaling, failure domain, and buildout reasons. When partitioned, we need to maintain the current API contract. Proposed change =============== An instance table will be added to the Nova api database that can store enough information about an instance to fulfill an instance list or show request from the API. It is not necessary that the instance table match the definition of an instance table within a cell, and it may actually be better to name this something different. It will be home to instances which do not belong to a cell and the only actions that can occur for instances in this table are to schedule them to a cell or delete them. Alternatives ------------ An alternative would be to use two different tables to handle the two cases in the ""Problem Description"" separately. This may ultimately make more sense. There could be a BuildRequest object and table which stores instances that have yet to be scheduled. This table would hold data for a short time before instances are scheduled. The short TTL of data here would allow for easy migrations of this data format in the future. Then there could be the instance table described in ""Proposed change"" which would hold instances which the scheduler could not find a cell for. These instances would be in an ERROR state with no action possible except to delete them. The primary purpose of this table would be to fulfill instance list or show requests from the API. Data model impact ----------------- This will be filled out after some discussion on which of the above approaches, or another alternate, would be a better path forward. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ An additional database write will be incurred. Other deployer impact --------------------- Instances that have not been scheduled yet will exist in this new table. Deployers will need to be aware of this to aid proper debugging. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: alaski Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Add new table to api database Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Since this is designed to be an internal re-architecting of Nova with no user visible changes the current suite of Tempest or functional tests should suffice. At some point we will want to look at how to test multiple cells or potentially exposing the concept of a cell in the API and we will tackle testing requirements then. Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation will be written describing the flow of an instance build and how this affects it. References ========== ",,150,0
