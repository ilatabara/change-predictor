There is a race condition in nova-compute with the ironic virt driver as
nodes get rebalanced. It can lead to compute nodes being removed in the
DB and not repopulated. Ultimately this prevents these nodes from being
scheduled to.

The main race condition involved is in update_available_resources in
the compute manager. When the list of compute nodes is queried, there is
a compute node belonging to the host that it does not expect to be
managing, i.e. it is an orphan. Between that time and deleting the
orphan, the real owner of the compute node takes ownership of it ( in
the resource tracker). However, the node is still deleted as the first
host is unaware of the ownership change.

This change prevents this from occurring by filtering on the host when
deleting a compute node. If another compute host has taken ownership of
a node, it will have updated the host field and this will prevent
deletion from occurring. The first host sees this has happened via the
ComputeHostNotFound exception, and avoids deleting its resource
provider.

In the fix for bug 1839560 [1][2], soft-deleted compute nodes may be
restored, to ensure we can reuse ironic node UUIDs as compute node
UUIDs. While this seems to largely work, it results in some nasty errors
being generated [3]:

    InvalidRequestError This session is in 'inactive' state, due to the
    SQL transaction being rolled back; no further SQL can be emitted
    within this transaction.

This happens because compute_node_create is decorated with
pick_context_manager_writer, which begins a transaction. While
_compute_node_get_and_update_deleted claims that calling a second
pick_context_manager_writer decorated function will begin a new
subtransaction, this does not appear to be the case.

This change removes pick_context_manager_writer from the
compute_node_create function, and adds a new _compute_node_create
function which ensures the transaction is finished if
_compute_node_get_and_update_deleted is called.

The new unit test added here fails without this change.

This change marks the removal of the final FIXME from the functional
test added in [4].

When migrating/resizing VM to destination
host that has VIF type difference from source VIF
type, it fails due to exception in unplugging
VIF on source host after user perform a confirmation
action.

This change unplugs the vifs in resize_instance and
wraps the call to unplug in confirm with an try except
block. the call to unplug_vifs in confirm is not removed
to support rolling upgrades but a todo is added to remove
it after the Wallaby release.

Apply join condition(s) between each\n  element to resolve.\n\nWhile the first of these was a trivial fix, the second one is a little\nmore involved. It was caused by attempting to build a query across\ntables that had no relationship as part of our archive logic. For\nexample, consider the following queries, generated early in\n\'_get_fk_stmts\':\n\n  SELECT instances.uuid\n  FROM instances, security_group_instance_association\n  WHERE security_group_instance_association.instance_uuid = instances.uuid\n    AND instances.id IN (__[POSTCOMPILE_id_1])\n\n  SELECT security_groups.id\n  FROM security_groups, security_group_instance_association, instances\n  WHERE security_group_instance_association.security_group_id = security_groups.id\n    AND instances.id IN (__[POSTCOMPILE_id_1])\n\nWhile the first of these is fine, the second is clearly wrong: why are\nwe filtering on a field that is of no relevance to our join? These were\ngenerated because we were attempting to archive one or more instances\n(in this case, the instance with id=1) and needed to find related tables\nto archive at the same time. A related table is any table that\nreferences our ""source"" table - \'instances\' here - by way of a foreign\nkey. For each of *these* tables, we then lookup each foreign key and\njoin back to the source table, filtering by matching entries in the\nsource table. The issue here is that we\'re looking up every foreign key.\nWhat we actually want to do is lookup only the foreign keys that point\nback to our source table.

Resolving the following SAWarning warnings:

  Coercing Subquery object into a select() for use in IN(); please pass
  a select() construct explicitly

  SELECT statement has a cartesian product between FROM element(s)
  ""foo"" and FROM element ""bar"". Apply join condition(s) between each
  element to resolve.

While the first of these was a trivial fix, the second one is a little
more involved. It was caused by attempting to build a query across
tables that had no relationship as part of our archive logic. For
example, consider the following queries, generated early in
'_get_fk_stmts':

  SELECT instances.uuid
  FROM instances, security_group_instance_association
  WHERE security_group_instance_association.instance_uuid = instances.uuid
    AND instances.id IN (__[POSTCOMPILE_id_1])

  SELECT security_groups.id
  FROM security_groups, security_group_instance_association, instances
  WHERE security_group_instance_association.security_group_id = security_groups.id
    AND instances.id IN (__[POSTCOMPILE_id_1])

While the first of these is fine, the second is clearly wrong: why are
we filtering on a field that is of no relevance to our join? These were
generated because we were attempting to archive one or more instances
(in this case, the instance with id=1) and needed to find related tables
to archive at the same time. A related table is any table that
references our ""source"" table - 'instances' here - by way of a foreign
key. For each of *these* tables, we then lookup each foreign key and
join back to the source table, filtering by matching entries in the
source table. The issue here is that we're looking up every foreign key.
What we actually want to do is lookup only the foreign keys that point
back to our source table. This flaw is why we were generating the second
SELECT above: the 'security_group_instance_association' has two foreign
keys, one pointing to our 'instances' table but also another pointing to
the 'security_groups' table. We want the first but not the second.

Resolve this by checking if the table that each foreign key points to is
actually the source table and simply skip if not. With this issue
resolved, we can enable errors on SAWarning warnings in general without
any filters.

When suspending a VM in OpenStack, Nova detaches all the mediated
devices from the guest machine, but does not reattach them on the resume
operation. This patch makes Nova reattach the mdevs that were detached
when the guest was suspended.

This behavior is due to libvirt not supporting the hot-unplug of
mediated devices at the time the feature was being developed. The
limitation has been lifted since then, and now we have to amend the
resume function so it will reattach the mediated devices that were
detached on suspension.

During live migration process, a _live_migration_monitor thread
checks progress of migration on source host, if for any reason
we hit infrastructure issue involving a DB/RPC/libvirt-timeout
failure, an Exception is raised to the nova-compute service and
instance/migration is set to ERROR state.

The issue is that we may let live-migration job running out of nova
control. At the end of job, guest is resumed on target host while
nova still reports it on source host, this may lead to a split-brain
situation if instance is restarted.

This change proposes to abort live-migration job if issue occurs
during _live_migration_monitor.

The regexes in test_archive_deleted_rows for multiple cells were
incorrect in that they were not isolating the search pattern and rather
could match with other rows in the result table as well, resulting in a
false positive.

This fixes the regexes and also adds one more server to the test
scenario in order to make sure archive_deleted_rows iterates at least
once to expose bugs that may be present in its internal iteration.

This patch is in preparation for a future patch that will change the
logic in archive_deleted_rows. Making this test more robust will more
thoroughly test for regression.

Previously, we archived deleted rows in batches of max_rows parents +
their child rows in a single database transaction. Doing it that way
limited how high a value of max_rows could be specified by the caller
because of the size of the database transaction it could generate.

For example, in a large scale deployment with hundreds of thousands of
deleted rows and constant server creation and deletion activity, a
value of max_rows=1000 might exceed the database's configured maximum
packet size or timeout due to a database deadlock, forcing the operator
to use a much lower max_rows value like 100 or 50.

And when the operator has e.g. 500,000 deleted instances rows (and
millions of deleted rows total) they are trying to archive, being
forced to use a max_rows value several orders of magnitude lower than
the number of rows they need to archive was a poor user experience.

This changes the logic to archive one parent row and its foreign key
related child rows one at a time in a single database transaction
while limiting the total number of rows per table as soon as it reaches
>= max_rows. Doing this will allow operators to choose more predictable
values for max_rows and get more progress per invocation of
archive_deleted_rows.

When [quota]count_usage_from_placement = true or
[quota]driver = nova.quota.UnifiedLimitsDriver, cores and ram quota
usage are counted from placement. When an instance is SHELVED_OFFLOADED,
it will not have allocations in placement, so its cores and ram should
not count against quota during that time.

This means however that when an instance is unshelved, there is a
possibility of going over quota if the cores and ram it needs were
allocated by some other instance(s) while it was SHELVED_OFFLOADED.

This fixes a bug where quota was not being properly enforced during
unshelve of a SHELVED_OFFLOADED instance when quota usage is counted
from placement. Test coverage is also added for the ""recheck"" quota
cases.

During resize, on the source host, in resize_instance(), the instance.host
and .node is updated to point to the destination host. This indicates to
the source host's resource tracker that the allocation of this instance
does not need to be tracked as an instance but as an outbound migration
instead. However for the source host's resource tracker to do that it,
needs to use the instance.old_flavor. Unfortunately the
instance.old_flavor is only set during finish_resize() on the
destination host. (resize_instance cast to the finish_resize). So it is
possible that a running resize_instance() set the instance.host to point
to the destination and then before the finish_resize could set the
old_flavor an update_available_resources periodic runs on the source
host. This causes that the allocation of this instance is not tracked as
an instance as the instance.host point to the destination but it is not
tracked as a migration either as the instance.old_flavor is not yet set.
So the allocation on the source host is simply dropped by the periodic
job.

When such migration is confirmed the confirm_resize() tries to drop
the same resource allocation again but fails as the pinned CPUs of the
instance already freed.

When such migration is reverted instead, then revert succeeds but the
source host resource allocation will not contain the resource allocation
of the instance until the next update_available_resources periodic runs
and corrects it.

This does not affect resources tracked exclusively in placement (e.g.
VCPU, MEMORY_MB, DISK_GB) but it does affect NUMA related resource that
are still tracked in the resource tracker (e.g. huge pages, pinned
CPUs).

This patch moves the instance.old_flavor setting to the source node to
the same transaction that sets the instance.host to point to the
destination host. Hence solving the race condition.

In some environments the libvirt nodedev list can become out of sync
with the current MAC address assigned to a netdev, As a result the
nodedev lookup can fail. This results in an uncaught libvirt exception
which breaks the update_available_resource function resultingin an
incorrect resource view in the database.

e.g. libvirt.libvirtError: Node device not found:
no node device with matching name 'net_enp7s0f3v1_ea_60_77_1f_21_50'

This change removes the dependency on the nodedev name when looking up
nic feature flags.

The late anti-affinity check runs in the compute manager to avoid
parallel scheduling requests to invalidate the anti-affinity server
group policy. When the check fails the instance is re-scheduled.
However this failure counted as a real instance boot failure of the
compute host and can lead to de-prioritization of the compute host
in the scheduler via BuildFailureWeigher. As the late anti-affinity
check does not indicate any fault of the compute host itself it
should not be counted towards the build failure counter.
This patch adds new build results to handle this case.

Because in the process of judging whether the image id is Duplicate,there is only deduplication without sorting, so no duplicate image error is judged as duplicate and an error ""Duplicate images in request"" is reported.

Now it is changed to sort after deduplication and then compare.

Two unit test cases were added to verify the fix

When cinder-api runs behind a load balancer(eg haproxy), the load
balancer can return 504 Gateway Timeout when cinder-api does not
respond within timeout. This change ensures nova retries deleting
a volume attachment in that case.

Also this change makes nova ignore 404 in the API call. This is
required because cinder might continue deleting the attachment even if
the load balancer returns 504. This also helps us in the situation
where the volume attachment was accidentally removed by users.

When cinderclient receives an error response from API, it raises one
of the exceptions from the cinderclient.exceptions module instead of
the cinderclient.apiclient.exceptions module.

This change fixes the wrong exception used to detect 500 error from
cinder API, so that API calls to detach volumes are properly retried.

Previously, the fernet token provider would log warnings when a fernet
token exceeded 255 characters, which is common for LDAP-backed
deployments. The warning is always issued, even when operators configure
keystone's max_token_size to a higher value, causing confusion because
it appears the configuration value is silently ignored.

This commit fixes that issue by using the max_token_size configuration
parameter consistently in the fernet token provider.

This is being proposed directly for stable/ussuri, since the
change only affects and makes sense on the stable/ussuri branch,
and it only touches the testing infrastructure.

The opensuse base which we are currently using these tests has
issues.

For 2023.2 branch specifically, masakari fails to interact with SQLalchemy
version that's being used in u-c. While needed patches were merged,
this was done after branching, leaving 2023.2 in a broken shape.

So we add sqlalchemy-migrate package to list of requirements

Using the mysql-operator charm as an example: juju add-relation ceph-radosgw:s3 mysql:s3-parameters Upon forming that relation, ceph-radosgw will create a bucket for use by the requirer, and transmit access information back to the requirer. The requirer then could use this to connect to the S3 endpoint to store application data. Only a single bucket will be created per requirer application. If an application relation is removed, the bucket *will* be preserved. If subsequently the application reestablishes the relation, the bucket will be reused.

I could say something about how pickle is dangerous if you've got a
compromised server sending malicious responses, but really, I just want
a way to read the response more easily via curl. It sucks needing to
come up with something like

    curl -s http://127.0.0.4:6040/sdb4/288 -X REPLICATE | \

Update both replicator and reconstructor to prefer JSON responses.
At some point in the future we may want to add an option in the
object-server to only respond with JSON, and eventually get rid of
pickle support entirely.

Backend config is a dictionary and it's attempted to be iterated as dict,
however it was missing items() call.

Tigera provides tools for managing Calico deployments (helm chart,

other networking solutions on the market and it looks like users can choose
on their own the CNI implementation.

There have not been many contributions to this chart for quite some time

Awhile back change I52046e6f7acdfb20eeba67dda59cbb5169e5d17e disabled
cinder in the nova-ovs-hybrid-plug job and added checks for cinder
before attempting to run evacuate BFV tests.

Resource setup for BFV was however not bypassed and the attempt to
setup a BFV server resource fails with:

  keystoneauth1.exceptions.catalog.EndpointNotFound: publicURL endpoint
  for volumev3 service not found

This adds a bypass to avoid attempting to create a BFV server when
cinder is not available.

This patch contains the known set of changes needed to make a gentoo
image build successfully.

- Standardize use of GENTOO_EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS, reduce duplication of
  options set there.
- Correct the cleanup commands to reflect standard Gentoo good
  practices by omitting --complete-graph, which is unneeded with --deep,
  and using --changed-use instead of --newuse to reduce unneeded package
  churn.
- Stop using deprecated layman command to manage reposiotry overlays,
  instead use new supported eselect-repository
- Set new USE flags required for LVM and installkernel. This was
  communicated via a Gentoo news item and is a required cleanup.
- Remove now-invalid skip of gpg if using musl

This is the set of changes needed to get the CI job passing and make DIB
build images at all, and we'd like to land them, but there are still
items we'd like to complete to enhance Gentoo support in DIB:
- Optional, built-in support for Gentoo binhosts -- where you can set a
  DIB_GENTOO_BINHOST=true (or similar) and have the binhost enabled by
  default.
- Make the default configuration of EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS more easily
  managed in a DIB-style manner, e.g. setting --quiet vs --verbose based
  on the value of DIB_DEBUG_TRACE.

This change reworks previous changes [1] and [2] that had
been respectively reverted and abandoned.

When using the config libvirt-image-backend=rbd, VMs
created from image have their disk data stored in ceph
instead of the compute node itself.

When performing live-migrations, both nodes need to
access the same ceph credentials to access the VM's
disk in ceph, but this is currently not possible
if the nodes involved pertain to different
nova-compute charm apps.

This patch changes app name sent to ceph to
'nova-compute-ceph-auth-c91ce26f', a unique name common to
all nova-compute apps, allowing all nova-compute apps to
use the same ceph auth.

This change also ensures newly deployed nodes install
the old credentials first on ceph-joined hook,
and then supercedes it with the new credentials
on ceph-changed hook, therefore also retaining
the old credentials.

With the new TC resolution the community replaces Extended Maintenance
with Unmaintained status [1].

So this patch transitions stable/yoga branch to Unmaintained as follows:
- tip of the stable/yoga branch is tagged with yoga-eom tag
- unmaintained/yoga branch will be cut from yoga-eom tag
- stable/yoga branch will be deleted

Some further notes:
- there will no longer be official releases off of yoga branch
- backports can be pushed against unmaintained/yoga branch
- openstack-unmaintained-core and <project>-unmaintained-core groups
  will have the rights to merge patches

For further details please read the resolution [1] & review and +1 this
patch if this is correct as soon as possible.

On Xena we added the use_quota DB field to volumes and snapshots to
unify the tracking of temporary resources, but we still had to keep
compatibility code for the old mechanisms (due to rolling
upgrades).

This patch removes compatibility code with the old mechanism and adds
additional cleanup code to remove the tracking in the volume metadata.

support.

Commit 31ff7ce7e2 implemented emulated multi-architecture support for
aarch64, s390x, ppc64le and mipsel, while riscv64 was left out, yet
considered in the blueprint
pick-guest-arch-based-on-host-arch-in-libvirt-driver.

This change extends the support to include RISCV64 in the list of
emulated architectures supported, related objects get a microversion
bump up.

This not great patch allows us to automatically retry when we
encounter a message from the BMC indicating that the requested
operation was invalid.

We've seen similar issues on other BMCs in the past, however
in this case the BMC uses a HTTP 400 error as opposed to a 500

In this patch:

  - Remove the first compareCPU() call (called via the wrapper
    _compare_cpu()) in _check_cpu_compatibility(), and let libvirt
    handle it.  (QEMU >=2.9 and libvirt >= 4.4.0 are the mininum
    required versions, and upstream Nova satisfies them by a good
    margin.)

  - Validate the user-configured CPU models from
    _get_cpu_model_mapping().  And take into account all the CPU flags
    before calling _compare_cpu().

    (Suggested-by: Sean Mooney -- thanks!)

  - Add a workaround to allow skipping the remaining compareCPU() call
    in _check_cpu_compatibility() as a potential future-proof (because
    we cannot test all possible CPU models and hardware).  Unlike the
    removed first call, this call takes into account the extra CPU flags
    provided by the user into account when evaluating guest CPU model
    compatibility.

As a follow up comes the patch[1] that replaces the older libvirt CPU
API with the newer one.

When cpu_policy is mixed the scheduler tries to find a valid CPU pinning
for each instance NUMA cell. However if there is an instance NUMA cell
that does not request any pinned CPUs then such logic will calculate
empty pinning information for that cell. Then the scheduler logic
wrongly assumes that an empty pinning result means there was no valid
pinning. However there is difference between a None result when no valid
pinning found, from an empty result [] which means there was nothing to
pin.

This patch makes sure that pinning == None is differentiated from
pinning == [].

The fasteners lib in version 0.15.0 removed the
threading.current_thread workaround for eventlet[1] because eventlet
seemed to fixed the current_thread issues tracked in [2]. However the
fix for [2] only fixed half of the problem. The threading.current_thread
call works if it is called from thread created by eventlet.spawn.
However if the thread is created with eventlet.spawn_n then
threading.current_thread is still broken and returns the ID of the
python native thread.

The fasteners' ReaderWriterLock depends heavily on
threading.current_thread to decide which thread holds a lock and to
allow re-entry of that thread. This leads to the situation that
multiple threads created from spawn_n could take the same
ReaderWriterLock at the same time.

The fair internal lock in oslo.concurrency uses ReaderWriterLock and
as a result such lock is broken for threads created with spawn_n.

Note that this issue was raised with eventlet in [3] when the we
detected it via a direct usage of ReaderWriterLock in the nova test
code. As [3] did not lead to a solution in eventlet we implemented a
nova local fix for the test code in [4].

However now we detected that nova is effected outside of the test code
as well. Nova uses oslo.concurrency's fair lock in the ResourceTracker.
The oslo.concurrency fair lock is affected by this issue as it uses
ReaderWriterLock in the background.

There is an oslo.concurrency fix proposed in [5]. But until that is
merged, released and the global requirements bumped this patch
implement a nova local fix for the issue.

Note that an issue[6] has been opened on fasteners to restore the
workaround[1].

The regexes in test_archive_deleted_rows for multiple cells were
incorrect in that they were not isolating the search pattern and rather
could match with other rows in the result table as well, resulting in a
false positive.

This fixes the regexes and also adds one more server to the test
scenario in order to make sure archive_deleted_rows iterates at least
once to expose bugs that may be present in its internal iteration.

This patch is in preparation for a future patch that will change the
logic in archive_deleted_rows. Making this test more robust will more
thoroughly test for regression.

Previously, we archived deleted rows in batches of max_rows parents +
their child rows in a single database transaction. Doing it that way
limited how high a value of max_rows could be specified by the caller
because of the size of the database transaction it could generate.

For example, in a large scale deployment with hundreds of thousands of
deleted rows and constant server creation and deletion activity, a
value of max_rows=1000 might exceed the database's configured maximum
packet size or timeout due to a database deadlock, forcing the operator
to use a much lower max_rows value like 100 or 50.

And when the operator has e.g. 500,000 deleted instances rows (and
millions of deleted rows total) they are trying to archive, being
forced to use a max_rows value several orders of magnitude lower than
the number of rows they need to archive was a poor user experience.

This changes the logic to archive one parent row and its foreign key
related child rows one at a time in a single database transaction
while limiting the total number of rows per table as soon as it reaches
>= max_rows. Doing this will allow operators to choose more predictable
values for max_rows and get more progress per invocation of
archive_deleted_rows.

When [quota]count_usage_from_placement = true or
[quota]driver = nova.quota.UnifiedLimitsDriver, cores and ram quota
usage are counted from placement. When an instance is SHELVED_OFFLOADED,
it will not have allocations in placement, so its cores and ram should
not count against quota during that time.

This means however that when an instance is unshelved, there is a
possibility of going over quota if the cores and ram it needs were
allocated by some other instance(s) while it was SHELVED_OFFLOADED.

This fixes a bug where quota was not being properly enforced during
unshelve of a SHELVED_OFFLOADED instance when quota usage is counted
from placement. Test coverage is also added for the ""recheck"" quota
cases.

Currently, when you delete an ironic instance, we trigger
and undeploy in ironic and we release our allocation in placement.
We do this well before the ironic node is actually available.

We have attempted to fix this my marking unavailable nodes
as reserved in placement. This works great until you try
and re-image lots of nodes.

It turns out, ironic nodes that are waiting for their automatic
clean to finish, are returned as a valid allocation candidates
for quite some time. Eventually we mark then as reserved.

This patch takes a strange approach, if we mark all nodes as
reserved as soon as the instance lands, we close the race.
That is, when the allocation is removed the node is still
unavailable until the next update of placement is done and
notices that the node has become available. That may or may
not have been after automatic cleaning. The trade off is
that when you don't have automatic cleaning, we wait a bit
longer to notice the node is available again.

Note, this is also useful when a broken Ironic node is
marked as in-maintainance while it is in-use by a nova
instance. In a similar way, we mark the Nova as reserved
immmeidately, rather than first waiting for the instance to be
deleted before reserving the resources in Placement.

The flag was added to prevent the source host neutron agents to trigger
a vif-plugged event too early during a live migration. But actually it
can be used in a more generic sense as the code filter on migration_to
binding profile attribute.

We saw too early vif-plugged events from neutron during evacuation in

workaround flag for this job too.

The get_* methods on the Flavor object use a common helper method to
build a query object to execute later.

Currently, the @api_db_api.context_manager.reader decorator which
manages the session is located on the helper method instead of on the
methods that actually execute the database queries. Part of the context
manager's job is to close the session after the query is executed.
Because the decorator is not on the methods that actually execute the
queries, those database connections are not being closed and it will
eventually lead to errors like:

  sqlalchemy.exc.TimeoutError: QueuePool limit of size 5 overflow 50
  reached, connection timed out, timeout 30.00 (Background on this
  error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/14/3o7r)

which means the connection pool size plus the overflow size has been
reached and the pool will block for a fixed period of time before
timing out and raising this error.

This removes the @api_db_api.context_manager.reader decorator from the
query build helper method and adds it to the Flavor.get_* methods that
execute the database queries.

Conflicts:
    nova/objects/flavor.py

NOTE(melwitt): The conflict is because change
I1355ac92202cb504a7814afaa1338a4a511f9b54 (db: Replace use of strings
in join, defer operations) is not in Yoga.

Because in the process of judging whether the image id is Duplicate,there is only deduplication without sorting, so no duplicate image error is judged as duplicate and an error ""Duplicate images in request"" is reported.

Now it is changed to sort after deduplication and then compare.

Two unit test cases were added to verify the fix

VPD handling was added in ab49f97b2c08294234c7bfd3dedb75780ca519e6 and
introduced a regression which was not caught by unit or functional
tests: if a VPD capability is present for a PCI device, it overrides
the network capabilities obtained from the associated netdev.

This change fixes the issue and adds additional test coverage.

Libvirt's node device driver accumulates and reports information
about host devices. Network capabilities reported by node device
driver for NIC contain information about HW offloads supported
by this NIC.

One of possible features reported by node device driver is
switchdev: a NIC capability to implement VFs similar to actual
HW switch ports (also referred to as SR-IOV OVS hardware offload).
From Neutron perspective, vnic-type should be set to ""direct"" and
""switchdev"" capability should be added to port binding profile to
enable HW offload (there are also configuration steps on compute
hosts to tune NIC config).

This patch was written to automatically translate ""switchdev"" from
VF network capabilities reported by node device driver to Neutron
port binding profile and allow user to skip manual step that
requires admin privileges.

Other capabilities are also translated: they are not used right
now, but provide visibility and can be utilized later.

Remote-managed port support relies on placing additional data into
the ""binding:profile"" attribute of a port: a mac address of a PF
associated with a VF and the VF number. This data is currently
retrieved via sysfs at the time when it needs to be placed into
binding:profile initially or when it needs to be updated during
migration processes.

To avoid having extra sysfs dependencies in the manager and neutron
modules, those attributes are now stored in the extra-info of a given
VF's PciDevice and persisted in the DB.

The PF mac is stored for each VF since PFs are not guaranteed to be
present in the whitelist and so may not be present in the database in
the first place. A by-product of that is that it is easier to access
this data by just looking at a given VF's extra-info dict.

Before this change, if a user requested a node to be cleaned
or ""managed"" with cleaning enabled when the user is in the
system scope, Ironic would attempt to user's token to
make the request to Neutron.

This, unfortunately, does not work, as the neutron client explicitly
requires a project ID to make the request to Neutron. As a result,
Ironic now falls back to it's internal credential configuration to make
the forward request, which matches the behavior if a node has been
unprovisioned and the cleaning has been started automatically.

Turns out the service role support doesn't quite work,
because you could not enumerate nodes regardless of node
owner or lessee in order to enable services like Nova to
enumerate nodes to be able to schedule upon them, or
networking-baremetal to enumerate ports in update mapping
in Neutron.

So this change enables permissions to be modified to allow
service project users with the service role to enumerate the
list of resources, and grants rights similar to ""system scoped
members"" to the service project's users with the ""service"" role
which aligns with update actions to provision/unprovision nodes.

Adds some additional rbac testing to ensure we appropriately
covered these access rights.

With the new TC resolution the community replaces Extended Maintenance
with Unmaintained status [1].

So this patch transitions stable/yoga branch to Unmaintained as follows:
- tip of the stable/yoga branch is tagged with yoga-eom tag
- unmaintained/yoga branch will be cut from yoga-eom tag
- stable/yoga branch will be deleted

Some further notes:
- there will no longer be official releases off of yoga branch
- backports can be pushed against unmaintained/yoga branch
- openstack-unmaintained-core and <project>-unmaintained-core groups
  will have the rights to merge patches

For further details please read the resolution [1] & review and +1 this
patch if this is correct as soon as possible.

With the new TC resolution the community replaces Extended Maintenance
with Unmaintained status [1].

So this patch transitions stable/yoga branch to Unmaintained as follows:
- tip of the stable/yoga branch is tagged with yoga-eom tag
- unmaintained/yoga branch will be cut from yoga-eom tag
- stable/yoga branch will be deleted

Some further notes:
- there will no longer be official releases off of yoga branch
- backports can be pushed against unmaintained/yoga branch
- openstack-unmaintained-core and <project>-unmaintained-core groups
  will have the rights to merge patches

For further details please read the resolution [1] & review and +1 this
patch if this is correct as soon as possible.

In Python 2, division with the / operator results in an integer-type
result if divisor and dividend are integer-typed - if one of them is of
type float, then the result will be a float.

Python 3 made this more explicit by introducing the // operator which
always results in an integer result while changing the / operator to
always return floats.

Some of our code relied on the old behavior and we need to update it to
use // so we don't put floats to placement or the vCenter where they
don't understand them.

There's even some code that relied on the new behavior and never worked
before - we don't update it here.

If a HTTPS termination listener exists, set the tune.ssl.cachesize
setting to use about half of the available
memory (free + buffers + cached) on the amphora minus the memory needed
for network sockets based on the global max connections setting.
A larger SSL cache allows for more resumed SSL sessions and
therefore less computationally expensive SSL handshakes.

The agent_down_time ends up being passed to an eventlet green-thread;
under the hood, this uses a CPython C-types interface with a limitation
of (2^32 / 2 - 1) INT_MAX (as defined in C) where int is usually 32 bits

I have set the max value to (2^32 / 2 - 1)/1000 as agent_down_time
configured in seconds, this ends up being 2147483.

This patch is required as passing a larger number
causes this error: OverflowError: timeout is too large

If a user currently has a value larger than (2^32 / 2 - 1)/1000 set,
Neutron Server will fail to start and will print out a very helpful
error message.

Consider volume and snapshots as below:

v1
|
`-- s1
    |
    `-- v2
        |
        `-- s2

User initiated deletion of snapshot s1.
It failed with some vague message.

Initially, it was suspected that ...
While copying volume v2 (sometimes an intermediate step to break
volume dependency), we send a request to clone the volume v2 to new
base volume; and the exception [1] isn't handled properly.

[1] Conflict (HTTP 409) 32 - volume has a child

However, on further investigation it was found that ...
after a new volume v2 (omv-<id>) is created and
when we try to delete old volume v2 (osv-<id>),
at this point the exception [1] is thrown as error.

This is now handled gracefully. Appropriate error is thrown
if the volume (v2) has snapshot (s2).

Remove the checks for quota for network, subnetwork, and port create
actions in the admin dashboards. While the checks are a nice feature
in the project daashboard, where they result in only one call, because
only one tenant needs to be checked, on the admin dashboard those
checks are too expensive — there is one for every tenant that has a
network. This is unacceptable on clouds that have hundreds of tenants,
and in addition it exhausts the default limit for memoization (25),
resulting in many other extra calls.

The effect of this is that the create action will no longer be grayed
out when the given user runs out of quota. This doesn't matter for the
admin user. If they try to perform the action, they will get a quota
error anyways.

This patch should significantly speed up the admin dashboards on large
clouds with a lot of tenants.

OVN deprecated the datapath_group column from Load_Balancer table. Now
this column was split in two: ls_datapath_group and lr_datapath_group.
This patch changes the code to also look for the datapath group in these

Logs show deprecation warning in the logs when creating backups.

Warnings are related to the ""backups"" and ""backup_gigabytes"" quota
resources:

  Deprecated: Default quota for resource: backups is set by the default
  quota flag: quota_backups, it is now deprecated. Please use the
  default quota class for default quota.

  Deprecated: Default quota for resource: backup_gigabytes is set by the
  default quota flag: quota_backup_gigabytes, it is now deprecated.
  Please use the default quota class for default quota.

This warning is shown because the ``quota_classes`` table doesn't have
entries for these 2 resources for the ""default"" quota class.

This patch adds a database migration to create the ``backups`` and
``backup_gigabytes`` entries in the ``quota_classes`` table like we have
for the other standard resources, such as ``volumes``, ``gigabytes``,
etc.

Nested quotas used a couple of DB fields named allocated and
allocated_id, but nested quotas driver has been gone for a while, and in
W we removed code references to these 2 fields, but we forgot to remove
the reference from the ORM models.

This means that we cannot remove the DB fields yet, as that would break
the rolling upgrades, because SQLAlchemy from the X release would still
try to load the fields based on its ORM models and would break because
it's expecting those 2 fields.  We should have removed the ORM model
references when we removed the code that used those fields.

In this patch we remove the ORM model fields and also leave a note as a
comment with the required changes (migration and tests) for the next
release to complete this process.

This creates an inconsistency between the ORM models in models.py which
would make the test_models_sync test fail.  To prevent it, the patch
also improves the filter_metadata_diff method to support diff directives
in the form of lists and leverages that functionality to be able to
ignore the discrepancies introduced in this patch until we make them be
on sync on the next release with the migration code that is included in
the comments.

limit of the `resource` column.

There are other 3 quota related tables (quotas, quota_classes,
reservations) that have a `resource` column, and they are all
referencing the same kind of thing, but they still have a maximum size
of 255 characters, so there will be things that we won't be able to do
when using a volume type with a 255 characters name. Some of the
operations we won't be able to do are setting a default quota limit for
it or migrate volumes using that volume type.

In usecases where only cinder is using ceph we currently do not
execute ceph_client role, which makes nodes failing to spawn instances
from RBD volumes.

Sample usecase where Glance might be using Swift and it might be desired to use
local storage for Nova ephemeral drives, but cinder spawning volumes
on Ceph

Currently this can be workarounded with setting `nova_rbd_inuse: True` but
at the same time `nova_libvirt_images_rbd_pool: ''`, though this is
counter-intuitive and this patch aims to improve this.

Currently when re-building the keystone primary node, a new set
of fernet keys will be created as none exists, despite keys
existing on the secondary nodes.

This patch uses a similar approach to the credential key
distribution where other nodes are checked for keys if none exist
on the first play host. In this case an rsync is performed to
distribute the keys correctly before proceeding.

The Cisco CIMC 4.1(2b) and potentially others do not
set the Location header as required by the Redfish
standard on a successful login, but return a session
object as a body.

By taking the session-uri out of the body,
we avoid leaking sessions in that situation.

If the proxy timed out while reading a replicated policy multi-part
response body, it would transform the ChunkReadTimeout to a
StopIteration. This masks the fact that the backend read has
terminated unexpectedly. The document_iters_to_multipart_byteranges
would complete iterating over parts and send a multipart terminator
line, even though no parts may have been sent.

This patch removes the conversion of ChunkReadTmeout to StopIteration.
The ChunkReadTimeout that is now raised prevents the
document_iters_to_multipart_byteranges 'for' loop completing and
therefore stops the multi-part terminator line being sent. It is
raised from the GetOrHeadHandler similar to other scenarios that raise
ChunkReadTimeouts while the resp body is being read.

A ChunkReadTimeout exception handler is removed in the
_iter_parts_from_response method. This handler was previously never
reached (because StopIteration rather than ChunkReadTimeout was raised
from _get_next_response_part), but if it were reached (i.e. with this
change) then it would repeat logging of the error and repeat
incrementing the node's error counter.

This change in the GetOrHeadHandler mimics a similar change in the
ECFragGetter [1].

Sicne 2023.1 we have started configuring haproxy backends per service
during specific playbook runtime. While it works in general, it requires
some extra steps to be run for upgrades to avoid race conditions,
when keepalived selects host as active that does not have any
backends configured.

To avoid this we suggest running haproxy with skipping keepalived
installation and proceed with backends configuration.

The VTEP switch support patch merged with a constraint of jsonschema
version 4.19 or above.

Except Debian only currently has 4.10, Centos 9 Stream only has 4.16,
and at present launchpad and the ubuntu mirror list is non-functional.

So in the interest of of packagers, we'll lower the version.

Note: I was able to successfully execute the unit tests with jsonschema
4.0.0 installed in the py3 virtualenv.

To facilitate the switch from Elasticsearch to OpenSearch, the ES
backend has been duplicated and renamed where appropriate to OpenSearch.

The OpenSearch implementation was modified in places for compatibility
with OpenSearch 2.x, for example:

- remove mapping name from bulk API URL
- replace put_mapping by post_mapping

This will allow for the future removal of the Elasticsearch backend.

With the new TC resolution the community replaces Extended Maintenance
with Unmaintained status [1].

So this patch transitions stable/yoga branch to Unmaintained as follows:
- tip of the stable/yoga branch is tagged with yoga-eom tag
- unmaintained/yoga branch will be cut from yoga-eom tag
- stable/yoga branch will be deleted

Some further notes:
- there will no longer be official releases off of yoga branch
- backports can be pushed against unmaintained/yoga branch
- openstack-unmaintained-core and <project>-unmaintained-core groups
  will have the rights to merge patches

For further details please read the resolution [1] & review and +1 this
patch if this is correct as soon as possible.

With the new TC resolution the community replaces Extended Maintenance
with Unmaintained status [1].

So this patch transitions stable/yoga branch to Unmaintained as follows:
- tip of the stable/yoga branch is tagged with yoga-eom tag
- unmaintained/yoga branch will be cut from yoga-eom tag
- stable/yoga branch will be deleted

Some further notes:
- there will no longer be official releases off of yoga branch
- backports can be pushed against unmaintained/yoga branch
- openstack-unmaintained-core and <project>-unmaintained-core groups
  will have the rights to merge patches

For further details please read the resolution [1] & review and +1 this
patch if this is correct as soon as possible.

There were 3 tests which were testing update of the segmentation_id for
the network with:
* no ports
* unbound or binding failed ports,
* bound ports.

Due to the nature of the fullstack tests, each of tests required to
spawn neutron server, neutron ovs agent, etc.
Now all of those tests are consolidated into one test end execution time
of test cases from that class went down from about 125 seconds to around

When an underlying block device (or driver) only supports 4KB IO,
this can cause some issues with aspects like using an ISO9660 filesystem
which can only support a maximum of 2KB IO.

The agent will now attempt to mount the filesystem *before* deleting the
supplied file, and should that fail it will mount the configuration drive
file from the ramdisk utilizing a loopback, and then extract the contents
of the ramdisk into a newly created VFAT filesystem which supports 4KB
block IO.

Turns out the service role support doesn't quite work,
because you could not enumerate nodes regardless of node
owner or lessee in order to enable services like Nova to
enumerate nodes to be able to schedule upon them, or
networking-baremetal to enumerate ports in update mapping
in Neutron.

So this change enables permissions to be modified to allow
service project users with the service role to enumerate the
list of resources, and grants rights similar to ""system scoped
members"" to the service project's users with the ""service"" role
which aligns with update actions to provision/unprovision nodes.

Adds some additional rbac testing to ensure we appropriately
covered these access rights.

pip 23.1 removed the ""setup.py install"" fallback for projects
that do not have pyproject.toml and now uses a pyproject.toml
which is vendored in pip.
To address that, this change adds the minimal pyproject.toml
to enable pbr to be properly used to build editable wheels.

This is required to support installing devstack on
centos stream 9 and related distros with GLOBAL_VENV=True
Without this change the wsgi scripts are not generated in
editable mode. i.e. pip install -e /opt/stack/keystone

See https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v23-1
and https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8368 for more
details on the removal of the fallback support.

setuptools v64.0.0 is used to support editable installs
via its PEP-660 implmentation

This reverts commit 955e621167987626806128d259a29d4e62acf102.

Reason for revert: the port binding handling done in this patch is
incorrect and leads to issues during the cold migration process with
trunk ports in ML2/OVN.

This patch replaces the Python script to monitor the ""keepalived""
status of a router instance with a bash script.

The goal of this patch is first to reduce the memory footprint of
this agent. The original Python script takes around 100MB of RSS.
The memory footprint of this script is around 7MB.

Second, to improve the stability. This shell script do not uses
threads to monitor the IP addresses, as in the Python script. It
uses an ""ip monitor"" context that exits every second to attend
to SIGHUP signals.

When the l3-agent is starting keepalived for a HA router,
it will first call disable() to make sure one is not
running. This causes two warnings to get printed, one
right after the other:

    Unable to access .../$id.pid.keepalived;
     Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

It prints it twice because of the code flow, by caching
the pid (if the file exists) and changing things slightly
it will only check the file once. With this we are also
able to combine two else branches into one as they were
both basically the same.

When an underlying block device (or driver) only supports 4KB IO,
this can cause some issues with aspects like using an ISO9660 filesystem
which can only support a maximum of 2KB IO.

The agent will now attempt to mount the filesystem *before* deleting the
supplied file, and should that fail it will mount the configuration drive
file from the ramdisk utilizing a loopback, and then extract the contents
of the ramdisk into a newly created VFAT filesystem which supports 4KB
block IO.

Sicne 2023.1 we have started configuring haproxy backends per service
during specific playbook runtime. While it works in general, it requires
some extra steps to be run for upgrades to avoid race conditions,
when keepalived selects host as active that does not have any
backends configured.

To avoid this we suggest running haproxy with skipping keepalived
installation and proceed with backends configuration.

See: https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/2051187

By default, juju allows extra params to be passed to an action.
This is risky here, because if a user makes a typo on a parameter,
it could be the difference between running a small fast set of tests,
or a very large slow set of tests...
For example, if the test-list or regex params are typoed.

Turns out the service role support doesn't quite work,
because you could not enumerate nodes regardless of node
owner or lessee in order to enable services like Nova to
enumerate nodes to be able to schedule upon them, or
networking-baremetal to enumerate ports in update mapping
in Neutron.

So this change enables permissions to be modified to allow
service project users with the service role to enumerate the
list of resources, and grants rights similar to ""system scoped
members"" to the service project's users with the ""service"" role
which aligns with update actions to provision/unprovision nodes.

Adds some additional rbac testing to ensure we appropriately
covered these access rights.

Currently a port can be created via a POST /v1/ports, with 'node_uuid'
and 'address' specified in the body. Now that we have logical names,
we should allow the port creation to accept the name of the node
instead of the UUID of the node. E.g. In request body pass ""node_name""
instead of ""node_uuid"". The change also allows updating the port
with ""node_name"" in the request body via PATCH /v1/ports. Now either

When an underlying block device (or driver) only supports 4KB IO,
this can cause some issues with aspects like using an ISO9660 filesystem
which can only support a maximum of 2KB IO.

The agent will now attempt to mount the filesystem *before* deleting the
supplied file, and should that fail it will mount the configuration drive
file from the ramdisk utilizing a loopback, and then extract the contents
of the ramdisk into a newly created VFAT filesystem which supports 4KB
block IO.
