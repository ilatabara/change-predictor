If an instance is deleted after the instance's disk image path has
been renamed by adding the ""_resize"" suffix to it but before the
resize operation completes, the libvirt driver will not delete the
orphaned files and manual intervention is needed to get them deleted.

This fix addresses the issue by attempting to rename the instance path
by adding a ""_del"" suffix and if that fails, renaming the instance path
with the ""_resize"" suffix by replacing the ""_resize"" suffix with the
""_del"" suffix.  If both renaming operations fail, the sequence is
repeated, in case the the disk image path initially had the ""_resize""
suffix and another thread removed it before the second rename operation
was attempted. These rename operations are used in favor of checking
for the existence of paths and deleting if found, because rename
operations are atomic whereas another thread could rename the path
between the exist check and the deleting.

Regardless of the outcome of the renaming operations, the existence of
the instance path with the ""_del"" suffix is verified and if it exists,
it is deleted. This is done in case a prior delete operation that
managed to create the ""_del"" path was subsequently interrupted before
all instance files could be deleted.

Note that the LibvirtConnTestCase.test_delete_instance_files test case
was removed in order to eliminate redundancy.

This proposal is to provide an option to cinder-create
that allows a user to have the volume partitioned and
formatted at create time, which will enable the volume
to then also be auto-mounted to the instance it's being

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== optional-format-on-create ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/optional-format-on-create Provide an option on volume creation to pre format the volume with a file system so it can be auto-mounted to a Nova instance. Problem description =================== Currently Cinder strictly provides raw block devices, which is great. The current workflow is: * cinder create * attach to instance * log in to instance and: - partition device - format device - mount device Cinder already has the capability to do things like attach a volume on the Cinder node and do things like xfr a boot image to it. Or clone the contents of another volume to it. It would be useful for a number of users to be able to actually specify a formatted volume at create time and also be able to instruct the attach process in Nova to actually mount it as well. This is just a ""helper"" to make things a bit more automated for end-users, but also could be extended to do things like setup multi-attach volumes with an appropriate FS. Proposed change =============== Add options to ""cinder create"" that allow a user to partition a volume as well as format it with a filesystem. We don't need to cover every possible FS or partition scheme but just pick some of the most common (ext3/4, xfs)? Options for partitioning can be provided via a set of basic partition schemes that could be selected from (similar to Nova's flavors). Formatting options could just be an option passed in via the create call. ""cinder list-partitions"" uuid: ""Linux-LVM"" uuid: ""Linux-Extended"" .... Formatting options would be limited to some basic commonly used FS's like ext-3/4, xfs So the ""cinder create"" call could look like: ""cinder create --partition <Linux-LVM-UUID> --format ext4 \ --name my-formatted-vol 100"" We'd use the existing internal cinder attach mechanisms to attach the newly created volume to the Cinder node, partition it and format it (similar to how we deal with loading images to a bootable volume, or cloning etc). The next step would be to add a mechanism to Nova's attach to allow specification of a mount point and have the volume auto-mounted. Alternatives ------------ You could do all of this on the compute side, but that's a bit messy and incurs risk of accidental formatting of a Volume that has data on it. The other option is just leave it as it is currently and leave all fo this as a manual process for the end user, but that's not an alternative, it's just accepting the status quo and ignoring the problem. Data model impact ----------------- Should be able to implement this without modifying the data model if preferred. Options here include using volume-metadata to mark it as formatted or do the same sort of thing we do with bootable and update the data model to include a ""formatted-on-create"" flag. REST API impact --------------- Example JSON schema definition { ""volume"": { ""availability_zone"": null, ""source_volid"": null, ""display_description"": null, ""snapshot_id"": null, ""size"": 10, ""display_name"": ""my_volume"", ""imageRef"": null, ""volume_type"": null, ""metadata"": {}, ""partition"": None, ""format"": None } } Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- Just makes life slightly easier Performance Impact ------------------ Adds some time to the create process if selected, but it's optional so if you don't want the time penalty don't use it. Other deployer impact --------------------- Shouldn't have an impact as it's a create option only Developer impact ---------------- Existing mechanisms for ""create volume from image"" are listed as required, so we should have all of the capabilities needed to do this in a generic manner that covers all existing/compliant drivers. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- John Griffith Work Items ---------- Implement the partition and format code in Cinders base driver Implement the API call in existing Cinder create Implement the required changes to python-cinderclient * Add capability to Nova's attach command to auto-mount (non-cinder task, and is not a requirement) Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Unit tests Functional test added to Tempest/Gate Documentation Impact ==================== Added options to cinder create References ========== ",,185,0

The alarm REST notifier does not have retry function: notification simply
fails, for example, when the receiver is down. With this patch, retry
function for alarm REST notifier is added.

In some cases, alarm notifier can not get response even if the receiver is
working fine (e.g. temporarily lost connection, failing over).
Currently, alarm notifier give up to notify in that case.
So, this patch introduces ability to retry to alarm notifier.

By setting a unique request-id in HTTP request header (same id on retry),
the receiver can decide if the notification is new or redundant.

Differencing VHDX images can be resized, unlike differencing VHD images.
Even so, the Nova Hyper-V driver currently does not support this.

This feature is required for resizing existing instances which use CoW
VHDX images and also in order to resize the root disk image when
spawning a new instance.

The methods which get the internal maximum size of a vhd/vhdx
image have been updated to lookup the parent disk and get the according
size instead of raising an exception in case of differencing images.

When a running VM is added to a security group, all existing VMs (ports)
in the security group should be notified/updated - otherwise they would
have incorrect rules, not knowing the new VM/port added.

The current behavior would only update the port of the added VM. This

We need to retain backwards compatibility, so this isn't the right

Also - there is no need to add extra environment variables, as the

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============== API Validation ============== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/congress/+spec/api-validation Users (and programs) sometimes provide invalid inputs to APIs. The API should be resilient to this, and deny bad requests. Problem description =================== Any request that does not conform to the form expected by the API is deemed invalid. Invalid requests should be rejected by the API, along with information to aid in correcting the problem. The following features are desirable in an API validation solution: * Validation should enforce a declarative model that is visible external to the validation implementation. * The declarative model should follow standard formatting and conventions that are understood in the API caller's context. * For cross-platform APIs, the model should be consumable without knowledge of a particular programming language. * The model should provide sufficient information for generation of resource documentation in associated API reference material. * Validation should be performed by a common framework which facilitates binding the declarative models with the API implementation. * The API implementation may assume trusted inputs by relying on the framework to offload validation. * Validation may be selectively enabled on API outputs to facilitate development and testing. Proposed change =============== We will introduce JSON schemas to model the expected inputs and outputs of each API call. The API resource manager will be updated to support binding of schemas to each handler. When dispatching API calls, the framework will validate the call body using the 'jsonschema' python validator. If an optional flag is provided, the dispatcher will validate the API handler response body before passing the response up the stack. Alternatives ------------ Other components, such as neutron, have created custom validation utilities. These utilities are often not as rich as JSON schema, and do not address many of the desirable features described above. The nova project is currently retrofitting their API to utilize JSON Schema validation: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/v3-api-schema Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- The current API provides very minimal validation. This change will add validation to all existing API calls. Security impact --------------- Adding validation to the API should increase security of the system by protecting the API implementation from unexpected inputs. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ Validation of inputs will have a negative performance impact on latency and throughput of API calls. JSON schema does not necessarily impose larger performance impacts than other validation solutions, despite its increased power and flexibility. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- After introduction of API validation, new API calls will need to introduce an associated schema. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: pballand Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Create JSON schemas for each API resource (This is already done in the API design, and simply needs to be translated to the source tree.) * Add support to the API resource manager to bind schemas with resource endpoints. * Add jsonschema as a runtime dependency. * Use jsonschema to validate requests before dispatching to API implementation. * Expose flag to support output validation. Optionally use jsonschema to validate body of API result before returning to the wsgi server. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= The schema validator is assumed to be thoroughly tested. We will test that validation is being performed by issuing requests that should and should not validate against the schema. Documentation Impact ==================== This change itself does not impact documentation. The addition of schemas for each API call should be included in the documentation.

Having the Stack create the Clients object means that custom constraints
do not have access to the already created clients. This greatly
complicates test mocking, and results in unnecessarily created
constraint-scoped clients.

This change makes the Clients be created in RequestContext on demand.
Constraints use the Clients associated with the context.

Mocking client create calls is simplified, generally needing to
call _create once instead of MultipleTimes()

The fanout queues of the fake driver are created at the first executor
poll, but if we use eventlet executor and the fake driver, when the sender
delivers a fanout message before the first poll, the message goes to the
topic queue instead of the server fanout queue.

The changes fixes that by ensuring the all queues exists when the
listener is created.

A resource plugin extension point is added to the resource
tracker to allow the types of resources allocated at the compute
node to be extensible. Information maintained by these plug-ins
is written to the compute_nodes table in the database. The
scheduler uses the information in the compute_nodes table to
determine scheduling decisions.

A plugin that implements vcpu resource tracking is included
and all other code for tracking vcpu has been removed. This
example ensures the plugins are tested in gate jobs.

Starting the task in handle_delete has the undesirable side-effect of
serializing the delete calls to nova, which results in a noticeable
serialization of the resource deletes for non-dependent resources.

Moving the start to check_delete_complete solves the problem, then the
resources all transition into DELETE_IN_PROGRESS at approximately the
same time, and it can be observed that the underlying nova servers are
set into deleting state in parallel.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =================================================================== Re-engineering Federation to standardize mapping and token creation =================================================================== `bp reengineered-federation <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/example>`_ We propose that the federated authentication process be reengineered so that requests for authentication are subject to a standardized process consisting of both protocol dependent and independent stages. Problem Description =================== Currently, the federation code uses saml2 specific modules for token creation and for managing the mapping and attribute extraction of external authentication data. While this is sufficient for the current release where only saml2 is supported as an authentication protocol, the upcoming changes for adding keystone-to-keystone federation as well as any further additions mean that processing other protocols will involve rewriting the logic for these operations. Proposed Change =============== We propose that the federation process be reengineered to allow standardization of authentication / authorization processes for all protocols In order to achieve this, incoming authentication requests from federated sources should following a common flow, using the same protocol independent modules to manage any common functions, and delegating any protocol dependent logic to protocol specific modules. We assume that every protocol will have its own protocol specific handling module in Keystone. In the case of an Apache plugin doing the protocol handling, then every plugin will potentially have its own protocol handling module (the exception would be if two Apache plugins communicate attributes in exactly the same way) The flow should be as follows: * The federation module should receive requests to the federation endpoint (OS-FEDERATION/identity_provider/{idp_id}/protocol/{protocol_id}/auth). * The data should be passed to the appropriate protocol module based on the specified protocol_id. The data should be processed according to the needs of the protocol and the following data extracted: * unique user ID (user_id) * authenticating IdP (idp_id) * list of dictionaries containing: * user identity attributes (list of key / value pairs) * IdP that issued them * When the extracted and formatted data is returned, the attributes should be filtered to remove any untrusted attributes using the proposed trusted attribute policy: `trusted_attribute_policy spec <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/100279/>`_ * Any remaining attributes should then be passed into the mapping engine and the resulting mapped groups and attributes should be returned. * This data should be passed the token creation module (currently called saml2 but should be renamed federated token creation). * Optionally, it should be allowed for deployments to choose to package the original attribute assertions in the final token alongside the mapped groups and attributes. Those implimentation concerned about token size would only hold the mapped data, those that want full provenance information would add the mapped data to the list of identity attributes/IdP issuer Alternatives ------------ Alternatively, each protocol added to Keystone could manage the mapping and token creation operations independently, however, any changes to the these interfaces would then have a large impact on federation. Data Model Impact ----------------- None REST API Impact --------------- None Security Impact --------------- As this spec involves changing the process by which tokens are produced, this could impact security. If the optional case of adding the original attribute assertions is enabled then extra user data is being exposed to any services which consume these tokens. Notifications Impact -------------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- This will not affect existing client operation, but ideally, clients should be updated to work with any avilable protocols. Performance Impact ------------------ This should not affect performance. Developer Impact ---------------- This would force developers to implement new federated protocols in a standardized way by requiring the return values of protocol modules to take the same form. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: None Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Reengineer the current federation process Dependencies ============ None but would complement the trusted attribute policy spec. Testing ======= Current federation tests should still provide coverage. Documentation Impact ==================== Development docs should specify the return structure for new protocols but end user experience should not change. Subsequent implementations should be easier as only protocol specific code should need to be added. References ========== None",,162,0

ML2 provider network partial specs let admins choose some
multiprovider network attributes and let neutron choose remaining
attributes. This change provides the implementation for
multiprovider networks.

In practice, for VLAN/GRE/VXLAN segments provider:segmentation_id
choice can be delegated to neutron, in such case neutron try to find
a segment in tenant network pools which respects provided segment
attributes. For VLAN segments provider:physical_network choice can
also be delegated.

The original workaround was for an init script that grabbed stdout.
This was some time ago and I think it's safe to remove.

It can be a problem on Fedora; out-of-the-box some old F20 images can

all helpful output goes into the temp log file, but it is never shown
because the install_packages function exits the script.  Thus things

Now Swift writes it's proxy-server-logs into syslog as well as swift-proxy.log.
This behaviour is to be changed after adding oslo.logging into Swift.
From the other hand, we use pipeline.setup_pipeline inside Swift. And all swift-logging configs
become applied to Ceilometer's pipeline. As a result (in case of DEBUG is on) we see too many
Ceilometr-related messages in syslog.

This fix partially closes the bug below.

Closes bug 1294789

Resampling a timeseries with one element is unnecessary,
and causes problems in the case of an aggregated timeseries
with aggregation method set to stddev, as the single already-

being undefined for a single datapoint.

The new test fails with the original unselective resampling.

The default conf file locator needed to reference the file another level up.

The config file set/write did not work if more than one option was changed.
I'm not sure why but think it would be better to just read once, set the
options, and write at the end anyway.

If we are updating and a service is there but not mentioned in the conf file,
we change the conf to True so should also add the service to the available

This unit test class added several race conditions to the unit tests as well as
added a dependency on having a valid tempest config file. At this point instead
of trying to fix all of these issues I'm pushing a revert in the short term and 
long-term we can just fix things and re-push these tests.

This reverts commit ae7c9ac4aac20a2832fe1beeaac0a688c6accbd9.

This is a POC for seeing the level of changes necessary for moving
the ResourceTracker in Scheduler with an interface.

The main issue is how the RT is accessing Driver methods, as it
needs to backport all driver calls to the computeManager and pass
the values in the parameters.

There are still some open questions, see the changes with the FIXME
and NOTE comments.

Implements blueprint scheduler-lib

Our `main blueprint`__ contains the usual links for blueprints, bugs, etc. __ contribute_ .. _contribute: http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute __ lp_ .. _lp: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-training-guides/+spec/openstack-training-labs Getting started --------------- The main script is osbash.sh. It will call libraries and other scripts to build the training-labs setup. The setup can be customized in labs/config where all scripts keep their configuration files. Prerequisites ------------- The labs scripts are designed to have minimal dependencies: bash and `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_. To support OS X, we keep the host-side scripts compatible with bash 3.2 (don't use features not present in that somewhat dated version). For testing the generated Windows batch scripts, any supported version of Windows (Vista and later) will do. After having created the batch files using osbash.sh, just copy the whole labs directory to Windows. If you don't have access to that operating system, comparing the output in labs/wbatch will tell you how your changes affect behavior on that platform. Coding style ------------ We follow the conventions of other OpenStack projects. Since labs scripts are currently all written in bash, the examples to follow are this project and `devstack <http://devstack.org/>`_. DevStack bash style guidelines can be found at the bottom of: https://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack/blob/master/HACKING.rst Testing ------- The labs scripts don't have automated tests yet. Patch submitters should be aware of their responsibility for ensuring that their code works and can be tested by reviewers. Useful tools for checking scripts: - `bashate <https://github.com/openstack-dev/bashate>`_ (must pass) - `shellcheck <https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck.git>`_ (optional) Submitting patches ------------------ These documents will help you submit patches to OpenStack projects (including this one): - https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GerritWorkflow - https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages If you change the behavior of the scripts as documented in the training-guides, add a DocImpact flag to alert the documentation team. For instance, add a line like this to your commit message: DocImpact new option added to osbash.sh - https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation/DocImpact Reviewing --------- Learn how to review (or what to expect when having your patches reviewed) here: - https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GerritWorkflow Anything not covered here ------------------------- Check README.md and get in touch with other scripts developers.

_reclaim_queued_deletes will only find instances in SOFT_DELETED
state and delete them if they are only old enough. The quotas will be
committed when the instance was soft-deleted so that resource can
be used right after the soft-delete operation.

There are some concern about the quota inconsistency for the operation,
The only case that the quota might be inconsistent is
the compute node died between set instance state to SOFT_DELETED
and quota commit to DB; when compute node start again
it will have no idea the reservation is committed or not or even
expired, since it's a rare case, so marked as todo.

There are some alternatives if the problem need to be fixed, e.g.
able to find reservation when nova compute restart, so we can double
check whether the quota is committed or not.

Currently RBD-backed ephemeral disks are created by downloading an image from
Glance to a local file, then uploading that file into RBD. Even if the file is
cached, uploading may take a long time, since 'rbd import' is synchronous and
slow. If the image is already stored in RBD by Glance, there's no need for any
local copies - it can be cloned to a new image for a new disk without copying
the data at all.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =================================================== Storage: Copy-on-write cloning for RBD-backed disks =================================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/rbd-clone-image-handler Currently RBD-backed ephemeral disks are created by downloading an image from Glance to a local file, then uploading that file into RBD. Even if the file is cached, uploading may take a long time, since 'rbd import' is synchronous and slow. If the image is already stored in RBD by Glance, there's no need for any local copies - it can be cloned to a new image for a new disk without copying the data at all. Problem description =================== The primary use case that benefits from this change is launching an instance from a Glance image where Ceph RBD backend is enabled for both Glance and Nova, and Glance images are stored in RBD in RAW format. Following problems are addressed: * Disk space on compute nodes is wasted by caching an additional copy of the image on each compute node that runs instances from that image. * Disk space in Ceph is wasted by uploading a full copy of an image instead of creating a copy-on-write clone. * Network capacity is wasted by downloading the image from RBD to a compute node the first time that node launches an instance from that image, and by uploading the image to RBD every time a new instance is launched from the same image. * Increased time required to launch an instance reduces elasticity of the cloud environment and increases the number of in-flight operations that have to be maintained by Nova. Proposed change =============== Extract RBD specific utility code into a new file, align its structure and provided functionality in line with similar code in Cinder. This includes the volume cleanup code that should be converted from rbd CLI to using the RBD library. Add utility functions to support cloning, including checks whether image exists and whether it can be cloned. Add direct_fetch() method to nova.virt.libvirt.imagebackend, make its implementation in the Rbd subclass try to clone the image when possible. Extend fetch_to_raw() in nova.virt.images to try direct_fetch() when a new optional backend parameter is passed. Make the libvirt driver pass the backend parameter. Instead of calling disk.get_disk_size() directly from verify_base_size(), which assumes the disk is stored locally, add a new method that is overridden by the Rbd subclass to get the disk size. Alternatives ------------ An alternative implementation based on the image-multiple-location blueprint (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/image-multiple-location) was tried in Icehouse. It was ultimately reverted, which can be attributed to a sum of multiple reasons: * The image-multiple-location implementation took a long time to stabilize, and didn't land until hours before Icehouse feature freeze. * The impact of image-multiple-location itself was significantly larger than that of the ephemeral RBD clone change that was built on top of it. * The impact included exposing nova.image.glance._get_locations() method that relies on Glance API v2 to code paths that assume Glance API v1, which caused LP bug #1291014 (https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1291014). This design has a significantly smaller footprint, and is mostly isolated to the RBD image backend in the libvirt driver. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- When Ceph RBD backend is enabled for Glance and Nova, there will be a noticeable difference in time and resource consumption when launching instances from Glance images in RAW and non-RAW formats. Performance Impact ------------------ In the primary use case defined in the `Problem description`_ section above, there will be a significant performance improvement. In other use cases, libvirt driver will introduce one more API call to Glance to retrieve a list of image locations. The performance impact of that call is insignificant compared to the time and resources it takes to fetch a full image from Glance in these use cases. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: jdurgin Other contributors: angdraug Work Items ---------- Current implementation (see `References`_) consists of following changes: * Move libvirt RBD utilities to a new file * Use library instead of CLI to cleanup RBD volumes * Enable cloning for rbd-backed ephemeral disks Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= This is a non-functional change with no impact on the test cases that need to be covered. That said, due to insufficient coverage of Ceph related use cases in OpenStack CI, testing this change will have to rely on external CI and on manual testing by interested parties. Fuel CI includes a suite of tests for OpenStack deployments with Ceph: https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-main/blob/master/fuelweb_test/tests/test_ceph.py Documentation Impact ==================== None.

This is a fix for the issues encountered when a service is not
configured or a service endpoint is not reachable. This fix
will add tolerance for these errors so that an error message is
displayed but the dashboard page will still load, not an error page.
This makes it easier for the user to recover by allowing them to
go to a different page, select a different region, or logout. This
makes sense in many cases such as when a region only contains an
image service endpoint, or when a single endpoint is not reachable
for whatever reason.

It also adds permissions to the panels that require compute or
image services so that the dashboard will not display them if
the service is not configured.

To test these changes you will need to set up your keystone service
catalog so that not all services are available in all regions, or
some of the service endpoints are not reachable.

Two new pages added: Settings page and ChangePassword page.
To test their functionality I wrote two tests:
1. test_user_settings_change
 * changes the system's language
 * changes the timezone
 * changes the number of items per page (page size)
2. test_password_change:
   changes the password, verifies it was indeed changed and
   resets to default password.

To allow the above I've made few changes in other places:

The get_num_instances method impl simply asks libvirt
how many running domains there are. This is flawed for
a number of reasons.

 - It doesn't filter out 'Domain-0' on Xen
 - It doesn't count inactive instances

As a result the value is returns is inconsistent with
the number of instances shown by 'list_instances'.
This will cause the _sync_power_states method in the
compute manager to constantly try to re-sync the list
of instances.

Remove the flawed impl and just allow the base class
default impl to be used. This just does a len() call
over the return of 'list_instances'. Previously this
was quite a heavy API call, but with new enough libvirt
it can be completed in a single API call which should
be fine.

Manila uses one service network for all backends, in this case
handling of all shared net resources should be covered with locks
in network modules.

Changes:
- added decorator 'device_name_synchronized' to remove concurrency
  issues.
- changed arg positions in related methods to satisfy requirement of
  decorator.
- with change of arg position was removed arg 'network_id' in
  metaclass 'LinuxInterfaceDriver' as redundant.

Manila's test framework is pretty old and requires update.

Changes:
- usage of nose replaced with testr
- now all the tests are thread safe
- added new options for run_tests.sh, such as --concurrency, --debug, etc...
- new '--concurrency' option for run_tests.sh defaults to 1, examples:
    ./run_tests.sh  # will run in 1 thread
    ./run_tests.sh --concurrency 2  # will run tests in 2 threads
- added tools/colorizer.py for colorizing output of testrun with run_tests.sh
- tests running with tox use as much threads as cores available by default
- examples of testrun with tox:
    tox  # will run test suites defined with 'envlist' in tox.ini, now it is pep8,py26,py27
    tox -epy27  # amount of threads is equal to amount of cores
    tox -epy27 -- --concurrency=2  # amount of threads is 2
    tox -epy27 -- --concurrency=4  # amount of threads is 4
- Added 'Database' class to manila.test module, for more conveniant db testing
- updated policy file 'manila/tests/policy.json' to allow share-network actions
- removed nose-related requirements
- added new requirements for testrepository, subunit

With merge of this change all old installed virtual environments become
incompatible and should be removed with ""rm -rf .tox .venv"" before testrun.

I attempted to use this function and found a few problems.

We shouldn’t unlink the file after closing it, because someone else could lock
it in between.  Switch to unlink before close.

If someone else locked the file between our open and flock, they are likely to
unlink it out from underneath us.  Then we have a lock on a file that no longer
exists.  So stat the filename after locking to make sure the inode hasn't
changed or gone away.

We probably shouldn’t unlink the file if we time out waiting for a lock.  So
move that to before the finally block.

The new API adds better support for storage policies and changes the
response from a list of backend urls to a dictionary with a key
""endpoints"" that's a list of of the backend urls and a new key headers
that's a dictionary of headers to send along with the backend request.
In the v2 response format for object requests, there the headers key
includes ""X-Backend-Storage-Policy-Index"" which indicates the storage
policy index for the endpoints returned in the response.

This change makes the following improvements to the output of a
ceilometer command with the --debug option set:

* Silences spurious logging from iso8601 and urllib3.connectionpool
* Removes the line number from the logging format, since the intent
  of --debug is to show the user what network requests are occuring.

This change adds the get_by_metadata_key function to the AggregateList object
and the aggregate_get_by_metadata_key function to the DB API.

Previously, the only DB API function available for finding aggregates matching
a metadata key returned a dictionary of aggregated metadata. The
aggregate_get_by_metadata_key function returns all rows matching the specified

The get_by_metadata_key function returns a list of Aggregate objects matching
the specified metadata key.

The functions in the common/tftp.py are not related to TFTP, the
functions are PXE related and most of them are used to generate the
PXE configuration file. Moving it from tftp.py to pxe_utils.py will make
it less confusing and is also needed by the iPXE work since iPXE doesn't
generate any configuration file under the TFTP folder.

The dhcp_options_for_instance() method was updated to not receive the PXE
boot file image from the parameters and just get it from the configuration
because we were always using the value from the configuration anyway.

During running of tox the system can timeout on slower systems.  This
is due to rpc calls to other threads failing in testing.  This
particular case involved shelving calls to start instances.  However,
when we started using objects, these calls became unnecessary for these
unit tests.  Thus we are removing the calls which should remove
the traceback for slow systems.

Prior to this change our heat templates define one virtual IP, which all
the services are bound to.

We wish to be able to segregate these endpoints: some need to be
accessible to ""the public""; some are only intended to be accessed within
the cloud; some are only for admin use.

This change adds a second VIP which we can use for binding only the
endpoints that are intended to be publicly accessible, leaving the older
VIP to be used for internal end points.

Haproxy is told to also listen on that new VIP so that we can expose selected
services via the new VIP, and keepalived is in charge of assigning the VIP to
control plane nodes.

This change has a proposed split of services between control-only and
control+public interfaces. Assuming our yaml parsers (in merge.py and
Heat) understand YAML anchors/aliases, and assuming I've got the syntax
right, this should get expanded so that all the control+public services
get their config defined from the same block without needing to repeat
it for each service. (AFAICT both merge.py and heat use pyyaml, which
does support aliases/anchors)

The default is left at binding to only the controlplane interface, so
that new services added to this map will default to being internal-only

Specification to change the Keystone dependency injection to referencing
the Registry objects directly instead of setting properties via
decorators. The dependencies will be passed in on manager instantiation.

This is an overall simplification of the dependency system.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =============================================================== Make Dependency Reference Global Namespace Instead of Injection =============================================================== `bp keystone-dependency-injection-to-global-namespace <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/ +spec/keystone-dependency-injection-to-global-namespace>`_ Keystone has made use of a series of dependency injection decorators over the last few cycles. This has resulted in a number of headaches in debugging, code clarity, and difficulty ensuring the right dependencies are injected into the right objects. We should simplify dependency injection and make it less problematic with fewer edge cases. Problem Description =================== Dependency injection has historically been fragile, the source of many bugs, and overall hard to ensure everything is working as expected. This stems from the desire to make the Managers something like a singleton (where a given manager is instantiated one time and then injected onto the object that requires it). Optional dependencies are even more fickle and have been the source of a few fairly significant bugs (revocation-api not really being optional and causing a security issue). .. Stop here! On your first proposal to the specs repo, only include the above sections, so that the community can agree on the problem statement itself. Propose the problem description in the ``specs/next/`` directory. Once the community has accepted the problem description, propose a solution (filling in the sections below) to a release directory (``specs/juno/`` for example). Proposed Change =============== The proposed solution is to make Managers work from the global namespace directly. Instead of applying the dependency property to the object that requires it, simply reference the global registry of manager objects. The dependency decorators would still be used (ensuring that only objects that are explicitly set to use a given dependency can do so). The proposed approach is to update the @dependency decorators to add a property to the object that would instead of receiving an injection, perform a lookup against the global registry. If the dependency is an requirement the property will raise an exception. If the dependency is optional, the property will return None. This will simplify the @dependency mechanism and help to make it easier to control required / optional dependencies. Alternatives ------------ 1. Make the objects directly reference (via a optional/required) interface on the global registry. If the dependency is required, raise an exception if it does not exist. If the dependency is optional, simply receive a None back. 2. Continue to maintain and expand functionality of the dependency injection. Security Impact --------------- None Notifications Impact -------------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- None Developer Impact ---------------- If the alternate solution #1 is picked, developers would need to access a given dependency via an interface on the Registry. If the proposed solution is selected there would be no change to developers. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Morgan Fainberg <mdrnstm> Work Items ---------- * Make the uses of the @dependency decorator apply a property that references the global registry instead of injecting a reference to the dependency onto the object itself.. Dependencies ============ None Documentation Impact ==================== None, the change would be transparent. References ========== None ",,136,0

They will contine to be a WIP until we get closer and closer to code complete. =============================== Erasure Coding Support in Swift =============================== ------------------------------- History and Theory of Operation ------------------------------- There's a lot of good material out there on Erasure Code (EC) theory, this short introduction is just meant to provide some basic context to help the reader better understand the implementation in Swift. Erassure Coding for storage applications grew out of Coding Theory as far back as the 1960s with the Reed-Solomon codes. These codes have been used for years in applications ranging from CDs to DVDs to general communications and, yes, even in the space program starting with Voyager! The basic idea is that some amount of data is broken up into smaller pieces called fragments and coded in such a way that it can be transmitted with the ability to tolerate the loss of some number of the coded fragments. That's where the word ""erasure"" comes in, if you transmit 14 fragments and only 13 are received then one of them is said to be ""erased"". The word ""erasure"" provides an important distinction with EC; it isn't about detecting errors, it’s about dealing with failures. Another important element of EC is that the number of erasures that can be tolerated can be adjusted to meet the needs of the application. At a high level EC works by using a specific scheme to break up a single data buffer into several smaller data buffers then, depending on the scheme, performing some encoding operation on that data in odder to generate addition information. So you end up with more data than you started with and that extra data is often called ""parity"". Note that there are many, many different encoding techniques that vary both in how they organize and manipulate the data as well by what means they use to calculate parity. For example, one scheme might rely on Galois Field Arithmetic while others may work with only XOR. The number of variations and details about their differences are well beyond the scope of this introduction, but we'll talk more about of few of them when we get into the implementation of EC in Swift. -------------------------------- Overview of EC Support in Swift -------------------------------- First and foremost, from an application perspective EC support is totally transparent. There are no EC related external API; a container is simply created using a Storage Policy defined to use EC and then interaction with the cluster is the same as any other durability policy. EC is implemented in Swift as a Storage Policy, see :doc:`overview_policies` for complete details on Storage Policies. Because support is implemented as a Storage Policy, all of the storage devices associated with your cluster's EC capability can be isolated. It is entirely possible to share devices between storage policies, but for EC it may make more sense to not only use separate devices but possibly even entire nodes dedicated for EC. EC support impacts many of the code paths and background operations for data stored in a container that was created with an EC policy however, as mentioned above, this is all transparent to users of the cluster. Note that it is possible to have multiple EC containers each with different EC policies that have different EC parameters just as it’s possible to have a cluster that has multiple different replication policies with different replication levels. The Swift code base doesn't include any of the algorithms necessary to perform the actual encoding and decoding of data; that is left to an external library. The Storage Policies architecture is leveraged to allow EC on a per container basis and the object rings still provide for placement of EC data fragments. Although there are several code paths that are unique to an operation associated with an EC policy, an external dependency to an Erasure Code library is what Swift counts on to perform the low level EC functions. The use of an external library allows for maximum flexibility as there are a significant number of options out there, each with its owns pros and cons that can vary greatly from one use case to another. --------------------------------------- PyECLib: External Erasure Code Library --------------------------------------- PyECLib is a Python Erasure Coding Library originally designed and written as part of the effort to add EC support to the Swift project, however it is an independent project. The library provides a well-defined and simple Python interface and internally implements a plug-in architecture allowing it to take advantage of many well-known C libraries such as * Jerasure at https://bitbucket.org/jimplank/jerasure) * GFComplete at https://bitbucket.org/jimplank/gf-complete) * Intel® ISA-L at https://01.org/intel%C2%AE-storage-acceleration-library-open-source-version * Or write your own! PyECLib itself therefore allows for not only choice, but further extensibility as well. PyECLib also comes with a handy utility to help determine the best algorithm to use based on the equipment that will be used (processors and server configurations may vary in performance per algorithm). More on this will be covered in the configuration section. PyECLib must be installed externally:: sudo pip install pyeclib For complete details on PyECLib, see https://bitbucket.org/kmgreen2/pyeclib ------------------------------ Storing and Retrieving Objects ------------------------------ We will discuss the details of how PUT and GET work in the ""Under the Hood"" section later on. The key point here is that all of the erasure code work goes on behind the scenes; this summary is a high level information overview only. The PUT flow looks like this: #. The proxy server streams in an object and buffers up some amount of data (configurable) #. The proxy server calls on PyECLib to encode the data into fragments #. The proxy streams the encoded fragments out to the storage nodes based on ring locations #. Rinse and repeat until the client is done sending data #. The client is notified of completion when a quorum is met (configurable). The GET flow looks like this: #. The proxy server makes simultaneous requests to some number of participating nodes* #. As soon as the proxy has the fragments it needs, it calls on PyECLib to decode the data #. The proxy streams the decoded data it has back to the client #. Rinse and repeat until the proxy is done sending data back to the client .. note:: There are multiple options for how many and which nodes are used to retrieve fragments on a GET request with varying performance tradeoffs. TODO: once we characterize this we need to include what the exact options are and explain some of the details on the tradeoffs. It may sound like, from this high level overview, that using EC is going to cause an explosion in the number of actual files stored in each node's local file system. Although it is true that more files will be stored (because an object is broken into pieces), the implementation works to minimize this where possible, more details are available in the Under the Hood section. -------------- Reconstruction -------------- The basic framework of how replication works is also used with an EC policy a few notable exceptions: * Because EC does actually replicate partitions, it needs to operate at a finer granularity than what is provided with rsync, therefore using an EC policy requires the use of ssync * Once a pair of nodes has determined the need to replace a missing object fragment, instead of pushing over a copy, like replication would do, the reconstructor has to read in enough surviving fragments from other nodes and perform a local reconstruction before it has the correct data to push to the other node. .. note:: EC work (encode and decode) takes place both on the proxy nodes, for GET operations, as well as on the storage node, for reconstruction. As with replication, reconstruction can be the result of rebalancing, bit-rot, drive failure or reverting data from a hand-off node back to its primary. -------------------------- Performance Considerations -------------------------- Big TODO here. ---------------------------- Using an Erasure Code Policy ---------------------------- To use an EC policy, the administrator simply needs to define an EC policy and setup the associated object ring. An example of how an EC policy can be setup is shown below:: [storage-policy:2] name = deepfreeze10-4 type = erasure_coding ec_type = rs_vand ec_num_data_fragments = 10 ec_num_parity_fragments = 4 Let’s take a closer look at each configuration parameter: * name: this is a standard storage policy parameter. See :doc:`overview_policies` for details. * type: set this to 'erasure_coding' to indicate that this is an EC policy * ec_type: set this value according to the available options in selected the PyECLib back-end. This specifies the EC scheme that is to be used. For example the option shown here selects Vandermonde Reed-Solomon encoding while an option of 'flat_xor_3' would select Flat-XOR based HD combination codes. See the PyECLib page for full details at https://bitbucket.org/kmgreen2/pyeclib * ec_num_data_fragments: the total number of fragments that will be comprised of data * ec_num_parity_fragments: the total number of fragments that will be comprised of parity When PyECLib encodes an object, it will break it into N fragments however during configuration what's important is how many of those data and how many are parity. So in the example above, PyECLib will actually break an object in 14 different fragments, 10 of them will be made up of actual object data and 4 of them will be made of parity data (calculations depending on ec_type). When deciding which devices to use in the EC policy's object ring, be sure to carefully consider the performance items mentioned earlier. Once you've made you changes to 'swift.conf' to configure your EC policy, and created your object ring, your application is ready to start using EC simply by creating a container with the specified name and interacting as usual. Migrating Between Policies -------------------------- A common usage of EC is to migrate less commonly accessed data from a more expensive but lower latency policy such as replication. When an application determines that it wants to move data from a replication policy to an EC policy, it simply needs to move the data from the EC container to a different container that was created with the target durability policy. -------------- Under the Hood -------------- Now that we've explained a little about EC support in Swift are and how to configure/use it, let's explore how EC fits in at the nuts-n-bolts level. Terminology ----------- The term 'fragment' has been used already to describe the output of the EC process (a series of fragments) however we need to define some other key terms here before going any deeper. Without paying special attention to using the correct terms consistently, it is very easy to get confused in a hurry! * segment: not to be confused with SLO/DLO use of the work, in EC we call a segment a series of consecutive HTTP chunks buffered up before performing an EC operation. * fragment: data and parity 'fragments' are generated when erasure coding transformation is applied to a segment. * EC archive: A concatenation of EC fragments; to a storage node this looks like an object * ec_k - number of EC data fragments (k is commonly used in the EC community for this purpose) * ec_m - number of EC parity fragments (m is commonly used in the EC community for this purpose) * chunk: HTTP chunks received over wire (term not used to describe any EC specific operation) Middleware ---------- There is no middleware impact or interaction with EC support. For example, if you are using SLO/DLO middleware, the segments of your large object will be erasure coded (if being stored in an EC policy container of course) in the same manner as any other object would be. The same thing goes for middleware like List Endpoints, you will get the endpoint information for the actual object, not the locations of all of its fragments. On Disk Storage --------------- EC archives are stored on disk in their respective objects-N directory based on their policy index. See :doc:`overview_policies` for details on per policy directory information. There are no special on disk storage impacts to EC policies. Proxy Server ------------ TODO Object Server ------------- TODO Metadata -------- TODO Database Updates ---------------- TODO The Reconstructor ----------------- TODO PyECLib ------- TODO ",,270,1

There is a need to have a way to record and respond to these changes. Proposed change =============== * Observer is responsible for managing the model of reality - both polling and handling notifications it provides an abstraction so that we can depend on an event based programming model for convergence logic. * polls nova/neutron/etc * listens for ceilometer etc * conceptually polls heat stack descriptions to update internal resources * Data model will need to store ""observed state"" * REST API will need to display ""observed state"" * Periodic tasks will be run on each observer to periodically poll backend services until such time as all backend services are covered by notification subscriptions. Alternatives ------------ - Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Work should be spread between all developers as much as possible to help spread awareness of how things work.

Layer 7 switching is also known as ""request switching"", ""application switching"", and ""content based routing"". A layer 7 switch presents to the outside world a ""virtual server"" that accepts requests on behalf of a number of servers and distributes those requests based on policies that use application data to determine which server should service which request. This allows for the application infrastructure to be specifically tuned/optimized to serve specific types of content. For example, one server can be tuned to serve only images, another for execution of server-side scripting languages like PHP and ASP, and another for static content such as HTML,CSS,and JavaScript. Problem description =================== Use Cases: 1. Redirect trafic to a Pool that supports static content (HTML,CSS) 2. Redirect trafic to a Pool that serves images (jpg,png,etc) Proposed change =============== Extend the LBaaS API and support Layer 7 switching. L7 Entities: 1. L7Rule - Set of attributes that defines which part of the request should be matched and how it should be matched. 2. L7Policy - A collection of L7Rules. Holds the action that should be performed when the rules are matched.(Redirect to Pool, Redirect to URL, Reject). L7Policy holds a Listner id, so a Listner can evaluate a collection of L7Policies. L7Policy will return 'true' when all of the L7Rules that belongs to this L7Policy are matched. L7Policies under a specific Listener are ordered and the first l7Policy that return a match will be executed. Alternatives ------------ None.

Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: https://launchpad.net/~avishayb Other contributors: **TBD** Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Dependencies ============ * Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in neutron, or in other projects, that this one either depends on or is related to. * If this requires functionality of another project that is not currently used by Neutron (such as the glance v2 API when we previously only required v1), document that fact. * Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not included in OpenStack? Or does it depend on a specific version of library? Testing ======= Please discuss how the change will be tested. We especially want to know what tempest tests will be added. It is assumed that unit test coverage will be added so that doesn't need to be mentioned explicitly, but discussion of why you think unit tests are sufficient and we don't need to add more tempest tests would need to be included. Is this untestable in gate given current limitations (specific hardware / software configurations available)? If so, are there mitigation plans (3rd party testing, gate enhancements, etc). Documentation Impact ==================== What is the impact on the docs team of this change? Some changes might require donating resources to the docs team to have the documentation updated. Don't repeat details discussed above, but please reference them here. References ========== Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any reference. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are: * Links to mailing list or IRC discussions * Links to notes from a summit session * Links to relevant research, if appropriate * Related specifications as appropriate (e.g. link any vendor documentation) * Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to",,375,0

Attempt to force-delete a volume if the regular delete times out in the
hopes that forcing the delete will actually remove the volume rather
than leak it and cause other test runs to fail.

This is only changing the non-admin tests for now to see if it helps
with stability, but a longer term consideration should happen for
refactoring the regular volume delete client calls with defaulting to
force-delete if they timeout, then we don't need this try/except logic
in every volume API test doing this same tear down.

This adds a connection pool adapter in the non-ssl
case and sets pool_maxsize on the session.

The default pool size is 10, this increases it to 1000
to see if it helps with avoid cases where the connection
pool is full and new connections are discarded.

Due to an assumption that libvirt live migrations work only when both
instance path and disk data is shared between source and destination
hosts (e.g. libvirt instances directory is on NFS), instance disks are
removed from shared storage when instance path is not shared (e.g. Ceph
RBD backend is enabled).

Distinguish cases that require shared instance drive and shared libvirt
instance directory. Reflect the fact that RBD backed instances have
shared instance drive (and no shared libvirt instance directory) in the
relevant conditionals.

UpgradeImpact: Live migrations from or to a compute host running a
version of Nova pre-dating this commit are disabled in order to
eliminate possibility of data loss. Upgrade Nova on both the source and
the target node before attempting a live migration.

Added extra column to backups tables (under instances
and under backups) that will show Yes / No if the
backup is incremental (ie it has a parent)

When you drill down into backup details we now display
the name of the backup parent if this is an
incremental backup. This is displayed as a link with
the backup name so it is navigable

When you create a new backup you can now specify
an existing backup to use as the parent

Note: At some point we should probably have the
create backup dialog filter the available parents
based on the current selection for the instance.
However, so far I haven't worked out how to make
the backup parent choiceField change dynamically
based on user updates to the instance choiceField

Problem description =================== Monolithic Neutron plugins are deprecated in Ice-house and will be removed in Juno. Fuel needs to be able to support this as it is the assumed entry point for all 3rd party modules. Proposed change =============== Some simple changes to the data structure sent by nailgun should allow for us to take advantage of the upstream puppet-neutron https://github.com/stackforge/puppet-neutron module. Some work will need to be taken in order to add back in our HA support into the module, however upon review this action may also help to simplify the neutron module and increase its effectiveness. nailgun currently provides .. code-block:: yaml network_scheme: provider: ovs interfaces: eth0: L2: vlan_splinters: ""off"" eth1: L2: vlan_splinters: ""off"" eth2: L2: vlan_splinters: ""off"" eth3: L2: vlan_splinters: ""off"" eth4: L2: vlan_splinters: ""off"" endpoints: br-mgmt: IP: - 192.168.0.4/24 br-ex: gateway: 10.108.43.1 IP: - 10.108.43.4/24 br-fw-admin: IP: - 10.108.42.4/24 br-prv: IP: none br-storage: IP: - 192.168.1.3/24 transformations: - name: br-eth0 action: add-br - bridge: br-eth0 name: eth0 action: add-port - name: br-eth1 action: add-br - bridge: br-eth1 name: eth1 action: add-port - name: br-eth2 action: add-br - bridge: br-eth2 name: eth2 action: add-port - name: br-eth3 action: add-br - bridge: br-eth3 name: eth3 action: add-port - name: br-eth4 action: add-br - bridge: br-eth4 name: eth4 action: add-port - name: br-ex action: add-br - name: br-mgmt action: add-br - name: br-storage action: add-br - name: br-fw-admin action: add-br - bridges: - br-eth4 - br-storage tags: - 102 - 0 action: add-patch - bridges: - br-eth1 - br-ex trunks: - 0 action: add-patch - bridges: - br-eth2 - br-mgmt tags: - 101 - 0 action: add-patch - bridges: - br-eth0 - br-fw-admin trunks: - 0 action: add-patch - name: br-prv action: add-br - bridges: - br-eth3 - br-prv action: add-patch roles: ex: br-ex management: br-mgmt fw-admin: br-fw-admin private: br-prv storage: br-storage version: ""1.0"" and .. code-block:: yaml quantum_settings: database: passwd: lVnpS5Qd metadata: metadata_proxy_shared_secret: VBqWVGHn keystone: admin_password: qRr8TVr8 predefined_networks: net04_ext: shared: false L3: gateway: 10.108.43.1 floating: 10.108.43.21:10.108.43.40 subnet: 10.108.43.0/24 nameservers: [] enable_dhcp: false L2: network_type: flat segment_id: physnet: physnet1 router_ext: true tenant: admin net04: shared: false L3: gateway: 192.168.111.1 floating: subnet: 192.168.111.0/24 nameservers: - 8.8.4.4 - 8.8.8.8 enable_dhcp: true L2: network_type: vlan segment_id: physnet: physnet2 router_ext: false tenant: admin L2: phys_nets: physnet1: bridge: br-ex vlan_range: physnet2: bridge: br-prv vlan_range: 1000:1030 base_mac: fa:16:3e:00:00:00 segmentation_type: vlan L3: use_namespaces: true Puppet modules Items to discuss: * sanitize_network_config: should be removed, we should be doing any of this testing in NeutronDeploymentSerlializer. * waistline: appears to be un-necessary and should be removed. * create_predefined_networks_and_routers: there are now separate handlers for these, we should use them instead. Follow-up actions (what to do after this bp): * possibly clean up q-agent-cleanup.py, there is open bug about time it takes to run * Its not necessary to run DHCP agent in HA, we can run more than one per network as HA solution. * need to support linuxbridge, this should be simply allowing network_scheme in astute.yaml to have less data, and passing slightly different data to quantum_settings. * ml2-plugin supports multiple type_drivers at a time, nailgun and UI should be updated to allow for this as well. Alternatives ------------ We can back port relevant portions of the ml2 plugin code from upstream, however this will further separate us from upstream which we want to work on regardless. Data model impact ----------------- Some changes to the astute.yaml: * rename quantum_settings to neutron_settings * add setting to track mechanisms * add setting to track type_drivers * add setting to track if using l2_population * add setting to track if using arp_responder REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- Possible change in layout of astute.yaml Performance Impact ------------------ New code should reduce dependancy complexity and hopefully improve deployment performance. Other deployer impact --------------------- quantum_settings should be further re-factored to more closely resemble the data structure consumed by the neutron model, however it's not a priority at this time. Developer impact ---------------- this will change the astute.yaml layout which would case it to become incompatible with older versions. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: xarses (Andrew Woodward) Other contributors: xenolog (Sergey Vasilenko) Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Dependencies ============ * This work is inclusive of pulling upstream puppet modules Children of this are: * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/mellanox-features-support * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/neutron-nsx-plugin-integration * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/neutron-vxlan-support Testing ======= Current CI should provide sufficient coverage as we are not adding new features at this time Upstream module contains significantly more rspec testing than current module. Documentation Impact ==================== Docs can be updated to reflect that ml2 plugin is used, and that other options might be supplied.

This borrows heavily from the compute notifications code. The basic
idea is that there are few classes of samples that can be had
(Fan, Temperature, Voltage, Current). Within these are potentially
multiple individual sensors and values. In all cases the volume and
unit of a sample can always be extracted from the value of a
'Sensor Reading' key. The volume is cast to a float. If the value
is 'Disabled' the data is dropped.

Each subclass exists to allow flexible handling via stevedore, but
all activity is performed in the superclass.

The supplied good test data is the currently blessed sample from the
Ironic team. The bad test data tickles either skipping missing data or
producing warnings in the log.

Identifier and name construction is worth a close look because this
is an area of frequent discussion:

* resource_id is composed from node_uuid and sensor id
* meter name is based on the class name and is generic, only
  paired with a resource_id does it identify a specific sensor
* unit is parsed out of sensor data and mapped to SI units

This patch adds the qa spec file for the
stress-api-tracking blueprint.

It has been expanded to include the tracking of api
calls from any tempest test, not just the stress tests.

Partially implements blueprint stress-api-tracking

Problem description =================== API Call success/failure statistics provide valuable information in stress test scenarios. However, manually tracking these in test cases is tedious and reduces the readability of tests. Proposed change =============== Create a decorator that can be applied to select client's that will automatically monitor the number of calls, successes, and failures. Run the stress test as usual. At the end of a stress test run, print out the statistics gathered. Failures are counted whenever a non-whitelisted exception is encountered. When a stress test calls an api, say volume_client.create_volume(), the stress framework should track that api call and note that it was successful or failed. When the stress test is done, it should have the option of dumping out the api calls and their success/fail rate. Something like this (as a cinder test example) [2013-05-24][10:12:28][A:668,E:2] ========================================= [2013-05-24][10:12:28][A:668,E:2] Test performed 668 actions.

The Xen driver duplicates quite a bit of code used to inject the `interfaces`
template into the guest.

This patch makes the Xen driver use the generic `netutils` version.

Parameter defaults were moved from the signature into the method since in the
original code, you wouldn't be able to override them due to their value being
populated at import-time, not run-time.

In some cases Neutron might send events such as 'VIF unplugged'
for instances which are either being deleted or shelved. When
that happens there will be a failure in dispatching the event
to the appropriate compute node - as there is no host for the
instance.

As multiple neutron events can be stashed in a single call
it is important to avoid that this kind of errors will prevent
processing of other events in the same call.

This patch does not process events for instances without a host,
marking them as failed.

When the above condition occurs, the create event request will
return a 207 response code. For specific events, a 422
unprocessable entity code will be set.

This patch also preserve the characteristic that events are
returned in the response in the same order they were found in
the request.

This change adds the ability to specify a X-Delete-At or
X-Delete-After attribute when using the FormPost middleware.

Here is an example of what you need to add to the form:

  <input type=""hidden"" name=""x_delete_at"" value=""<unix-timestamp>""/>
  <input type=""hidden"" name=""x_delete_after"" value=""<seconds>""/>

To be inline with the other form imput names, x-delete-at/after has
changed to x_delete_at/after.

Currently, live migration will be failed when using shared instance
path with QCOW2 because of a UnboundLocalError caused by referencing
to 'instance_dir'.

The fix was changing the logic of _create_images_and_backing() only
in the condition of not is_shared_instance_path and not
is_shared_block_storage.

The Telemetry chapter was previously missing from the admin guide. This
patch adds an xml file for introducing a new chapter for this component
and also contains five main sections in the form of new files.

It will require several patch sets to fill all sections with content.
This patch contains partial content in the first two sections, namely
the System Architecture and the Data Collection.

To avoid creating additional user_creds entries for every nested
stack, pass in the parent/owner stack user_creds_id.  This means
updates will work with trust-scoped tokens, and will remove the
overhead of creating a new trust for every nested resource.

This will also avoid the potential situation where a stack has been
updated (adding nested stacks) by a user other than the original
stack owner - if that happened, it would be impossible to delete
the stacks (owner and nested) as any user other than an admin,
due to restrictions on who can delete the trust.

Note the delete logic is modified so nested stacks no longer delete
the user_creds ID.  If we stick with this simple logic, it will
mean it's necessary to either delete all stacks before upgrading
or do a manual DB query to clean up any orphaned user_creds rows
when existing nested stacks are deleted (such a cleanup is probably
already necessary due to the previous patch fixing user_creds
handling for backup stacks)

Also modifies the stub_keystoneclient test call to make stubbing
the client in the parser test easier.

Zake was released with a new version with bug fixes
and a addition of the emulation of one more of the
kazoo methods (transaction check support).

This change helps make it possible to test the fix
for bug 1343029 without requiring a full zookeeper
setup to test.

The zake *noteable* changes (for those interested):

- Add travis 3.4 builds
- Add more concurrent transaction tests
- Add much more robust transaction support
- Add basic check transaction support + tests
- Create all parent paths and child paths in the same lock context
- Address concurrent client variable modification
- Move znode making function to storage
- Add link to kazoo readthedocs
- Add test + fix for empty custom versions being provided
- Fix custom version in 'stat' response
- Ensure all paths are normalized before storage interaction

there are several other options: provide user before whole class

But\ there is no direct way to retrieve/monitor the node details, like \ * Firmware version\ * Power, Temperature statistics. \ * Faults\ * Inventory. etc\ \ As there is no GET API option available, It is difficult to integrate Ironic\ with other OpenStack/third-party components to monitor the bare-metal node\ health, faults, statistics etc. \ \ Proposed change\ ===============\ \ Vendor_passthru APIs already supports HTTP POST method. As part of the change \ reuse this existing part of framework and add GET method support. Unlike POST \ method support, where it spawns a new task and returns, the GET vendor_passthru\ API call would be blocking call. As GET method returns value to the user, the \ call is blocked until the conductor returns the response or the blocking call \ reaches pre-defined timeout. \ \ Alternatives\ ------------\ \ There are no alternatives. User have to login to bare-maetal node and fetch the\ inventory,faults etc., manually. or Extend the other openstack/third-party com-\ ponents to talk to bare-metal nodes and get these details. Either way, user \ have to know the list of here-metal nodes enrolled in Ironic and perform the \ operations. \ \ Data model impact\ -----------------\ None.\ \ REST API impact\ ---------------\ \ Adding support for vendor_passthru GET method. \ \ * Method type - GET\ \ * Expected error http response code(s)\ \ If unsuccessful, eg an invalid driver name was specified, \ it returns HTTP status 404 and an error message.\ If successful, it returns HTTP status 200 and the response \ (in Json format) is a list of \ <property-name>: <value>\ \ Ex: /node/<node_uuid>/vendor_passthru?method=get_firmware_version return:\ \ \{""Dn"": ""sys/chassis-1/blade-5/fw-status"", \ ""OperState"": ""ready"", \ ""PackageVersion"": ""2.1(1a)B\'94\} \ \ * No parameters are passed via the url.\ \ \ Driver API impact\ -----------------\ \ None.\ \ Nova driver impact\ ------------------\ None.\ \ Security impact\ ---------------\ \ None\ \ Other end user impact\ ---------------------\ \ This requires the python-ironicclient changes for adding CLI support. \ Changes to print the GET method results in readable format like other CLIs \ output.\ \ Example:\ usage: ironic node-vendor-passthru <node id> <method_type> <method>\ [<arg=value> [<arg=value> ...]]\ \ stack@juno:/$ ironic node-vendor-passthru <node_uuid> get get_faults\ \ * As of now there is no interface to invoke the vendor_passthru APIs from \ Horizon.\ Not considering to add support for the same as part of this blueprint. \ \ Scalability impact\ ------------------\ \ * As the info is not stored in DB, GET method support would not have any \ impact on database traffic. \ \ * Each call to the GET API would result in conductor querying the data from \ bare-metal node. \ \ * There might have impact on network, RPC calls depending on the frequency of \ call made by the user/end-applications. \ \ Performance Impact\ ------------------\ \ There is no other performance impact other than what is discussed in \ \'91Scalability Impact\'92 section. \ \ Other deployer impact\ ---------------------\ \ None.\ \ Developer impact\ ----------------\ \ None\ \ Implementation\ ==============\ \ Assignee(s)\ -----------\ \ \ Primary assignee:\ saripurigopi\ \ Other contributors:\ <launchpad-id or None>\ \ Work Items\ ----------\ \ * Changes to ironic-api to process GET methods for vendor_passthru APIs.\ * Changes to ironic-conductor for handle GET methods requests. \ * Changes to the python-ironicclient, add support for GET vendor_passthru CLIs.\ \ Dependencies\ ============\ \ None.\ \ Testing\ =======\ \ Tempest test can be added for node_level GET operations. But this requires the\ list of supported GET methods per driver. This isn't not as generic. In order \ to support this, we need to have a way to get the list of vendor_passthru APIs\ supported by driver with the signature of the methods. If required that can be\ tracked as different request.\ \ Documentation Impact\ ====================\ \ Documentation have to be updated with the HTTP GET method availability for \ vendor_passthru APIs.\ \ \ References\ ==========\ \ None. \ }",176,184

ML2 provider networks partial specs let admins choose some provider
network attributes and let neutron choose remaining attributes. This
change provides the implementation for GRE/VXLAN provider networks.

In practice, for GRE/VXLAN provider networks provider:segmentation_id
choice can be delegated to neutron, in such case neutron will try to
find a network in tenant network pools which respects provided
provider attributes.

Having all the console scripts in one file means that we always pull
in all the dependencies. This presents a problem in downstream packaging,
for example, a distro alarm subpackage required pymongo dependencies
installed, even if not used.

This patch separates the console scripts into a 'cmd' module, the
way Nova does it. Eventlet monkey patching is done in the module's
__init__.py file.

If the underlying associated iptables rules have previously been deleted, for example by restarting the Nova compute service, then the instance will be brought up without security groups applied. Deployments using Neutron are not impacted. ### Affected Services / Software ### Nova, Havana, Grizzly ### Discussion ### In Nova deployments using Nova Networking, Security Groups are implemented using iptables, which is used to configure and control network traffic in and out of Nova instances. If an instance is rebooted using the soft reboot method (nova reboot <instance_id>) the IP tables rules are not re-instated when the instance boots, therefore if the rules have previously been deleted, the instance will be brought up without Security Group enforcement. Depending on the deployment architecture, this could breach security assumptions and leave an instance vulnerable to network based attacks. This situation is most likely to arise in cases where the Nova compute service has been terminated or restarted, which removes all iptables rules. ### Recommended Actions ### - Do not to use the soft reboot method to start instances from the stopped state. - If VMs are in the stopped state, boot using ""nova boot <instance>"" or reboot using ""nova reboot --hard"". ### Contacts / References ### This OSSN : https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0022 Original LaunchPad Bug : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1316822 OpenStack Security ML : openstack-security@lists.openstack.org OpenStack Security Group : https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg ",,39,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ======================================================== EDP Swift authentication using Keystone trust delegation ======================================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sahara/+spec/edp-swift-trust-authentication Sahara currently stores and distributes credentials for access to Swift objects. These credentials are stored and transmitted in cleartext. This blueprint describes a method of using Keystone’s trust delegation mechanism to remove the cleartext credentials from Sahara. Problem description =================== Sahara allows access to job binaries and data sources stored in Swift containers by storing credentials to those containers. The credentials are stored in Sahara’s database and distributed to cluster instances as part of a job’s workflow, or used by Sahara to access job binaries. In both cases, database and workflow, these credentials are stored in cleartext. The storage of sensitive information in cleartext presents a security risk on both the Sahara controller node and the cluster instance nodes. Proposed change =============== A solution to using credentials for access to Swift objects is to generate a Keystone trust between the user with access to those objects and the Sahara admin user. The trust would be established based on the user’s membership in the project that contains the Swift objects. Using this trust the Sahara user could generate authentication tokens to access the Swift objects. When access is no longer needed the trust can be revoked thus invalidating the tokens. With this methodology Sahara could move away from distributing the credentials for access and instead distribute tokens. In addition Sahara would not need to store tokens for long periods of time as they could be regenerated when needed. General breakdown of the process: 1. When a new job that involves Swift objects is created, a trust for the context user’s role is delegated from the context user to the Sahara admin user. 2. A periodic update is maintained that will acquire a token associated with the delegated trust. This task will place the token in a key/value store on all instances in the cluster. It will update the token based on the timeout value dictated by Keystone. 3. When an instance needs to access a Swift object it uses the token in it’s local key/value store to access that object. 4. When a job has ended, the delegated trust will be revoked from the Sahara admin user, the stored token on all cluster instances will be removed, and the periodic update associated with the job will be cleared. Detailed breakdown: Step 1. Whenever a new job is issued through Sahara a new trust is generated by requesting it from Keystone using the access credentials of the context user. The “context user” is defined as the user who is currently logged in to OpenStack. The trust will be based on the context user’s “Member” role in the project that is associated with the Swift objects. Because Sahara does not know how long a job will run the trust will need to be established with no expiration date and unlimited reuses. The trust will also need to be established with impersonation to allow for cases where output needs to be written. By using impersonation we will ensure that created files will be owned by the context user. When a job is created, the unique identifier associated with it will be recorded in the workflow.xml that is passed to the cluster instances. In this respect the job identifier will be used as the primary means of coordinating authentication tokens from the instances. Step 2. For each job started, Sahara will need to maintain a periodic update responsible for acquiring and distributing trust based authentication tokens. Keystone defines the length of time that each token is valid for, and because of this Sahara will need to keep the tokens refreshed. On the cluster instances the tokens should be stored and associated with a unique identifier for their job. This would take the form of a file stored in a Sahara specific directory for the cloud user on each instance requiring access. The files would be named as their job identifier and store only their trust based token. Step 3. During job execution when an instance needs access to a Swift object, the Swift file system connector will take the unique job identifier from the workflow and open the file with the same name. From the file a Keystone token will be extracted and used as the method of authentication to the Swift object. Step 4. After a job has completed Sahara will revoke the trust from Keystone using the context user’s credentials. Additionally the periodic update associated with the job will be removed and the token files from each instance will be destroyed. Alternatives ------------ Two alternatives have been discussed regarding this issue; using Swift’s TempURL mechanism, and encrypting the Swift credentials. Swift implements a feature named TempURL which allows the generation of temporary URLs to allow public access to Swift objects. Using this feature Sahara could create TempURLs for each Swift object that requires access and then distribute these URLs to the cluster instances in the job workflow. Although TempURLs would be low impact in terms of the work required to implement they have a few major drawbacks for Sahara’s use case. When creating a TempURL an expiration date must be associated with the URL. As job lengths in Sahara cannot be predictively determined this would mean creating indefinite expiration dates for the TempURLs. A solution to this would be deleting the Swift object or changing the authentication identifier associated with the creation of the TempURL. Both of these options present implications that run beyond the boundaries of Sahara. In addition the TempURLs would need to be passed to the instances as ciphertext to avoid potential security breaches. The other methodology discussed involves encrypting the Swift credentials and allowing the cluster instances to decrypt them when access is required. Using this method would involve Sahara generating a two part public/private key that would be used to encrypt all credentials. The decryption, or private, part of the key would be distributed to all cluster nodes. Upon job creation the Swift credentials associated with the job would be encrypted and stored. The encrypted credentials would be distributed to the cluster instances in the job workflow. When access is needed to a Swift object, an instance would decrypt the credentials using the locally stored key. Encrypting the credentials poses a lower amount of change over using Keystone trusts but perpetuates the current ideology of Sahara storing credentials for Swift objects. In addition a new layer of security management becomes involved in the form of Sahara needing to generate and store keys for use with the credentials. This complexity adds another layer of management that could instead be relegated to a more appropriate OpenStack service(i.e. Keystone). Data model impact ----------------- The data model would need to be changed to remove the username and password associated with Swift objects for each data source and job. The impact for databases that were unable to migrate these changes would be limited as the fields would no longer be used. REST API impact --------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- Users will no longer need to enter credentials when adding Swift data sources to their jobs. The user’s OpenStack credentials will need to have sufficient privileges to access the Swift objects they add. From the python-saharaclient, developers will no longer need to enter credential_user or credential_pass when making a requests to create data sources. Deployer impact --------------- None Developer impact ---------------- Developers will no longer need to pass credentials when creating data sources. Sahara-image-elements impact ---------------------------- None Sahara-dashboard / Horizon impact --------------------------------- The username and password fields will need to be removed from the Swift data source forms and views. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Other contributors: Work Items ---------- * Trust acquisition per job * Periodic token updater * Token distribution to instances * Swift file system component update to use tokens * Trust revocation and token destruction Dependencies ============ This feature will require the usage of Keystone v3 with the OS-TRUST mechanism enabled. There will also be a dependency on the Horizon change(removing username/password), which will ultimately depend on the Sahara dashboard merges. The Hadoop Swift file system component will need to be updated as well. Testing ======= The current tests for Swift based objects will need to be modified to remove the usage of username/password credentials. Otherwise these tests should prove that the trust method is working properly. Tests for situations where a user’s Keystone access do not permit permission for the Swift objects they are adding should be implemented. Tests should also be generated for conditions where a token expiration occurs during operation to ensure that the instances will properly recover and wait for a token update or fail. The token distribution methods will need testing to ensure that a failed token update can be handled. The Swift file system component will need it’s tests modified for the token key/value store, as well as access to the Swift objects. These tests should include token expiration as well as general work flow. Documentation Impact ==================== The documentation for usage of Swift storage will need to have references to the object credentials removed. Additionally there should be documentation added about the impact of a user not having access to the Swift sources.

If the underlying associated iptables rules have previously been deleted, for example by restarting the Nova compute service, then the instance will be brought up without security groups applied. Deployments using Neutron are not impacted. ### Affected Services / Software ### Nova, Havana, Grizzly ### Discussion ### In Nova deployments using Nova Networking, Security Groups are implemented using iptables, which is used to configure and control network traffic in and out of Nova instances. If an instance is rebooted using the soft reboot method (nova reboot <instance_id>) the IP tables rules are not re-instated when the instance boots, therefore if the rules have previously been deleted, the instance will be brought up without Security Group enforcement. Depending on the deployment architecture, this could breach security assumptions and leave an instance vulnerable to network based attacks. This situation is most likely to arise in cases where the Nova compute service has been terminated or restarted, which removes all iptables rules. ### Recommended Actions ### - Do not to use the soft reboot method to start instances from the stopped state. - If VMs are in the stopped state, boot using ""nova boot <instance>"" or reboot using ""nova reboot --hard"". ### Contacts / References ### This OSSN : https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0022 Original LaunchPad Bug : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1316822 OpenStack Security ML : openstack-security@lists.openstack.org OpenStack Security Group : https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg ",,40,0

If the underlying associated iptables rules have previously been deleted, for example by restarting the Nova compute service, then the instance will be brought up without security groups applied. Deployments using Neutron are not impacted. ### Affected Services / Software ### Nova, Havana, Grizzly ### Discussion ### In Nova deployments using Nova Networking, Security Groups are implemented using iptables, which is used to configure and control network traffic in and out of Nova instances. If an instance is rebooted using the soft reboot method (nova reboot <instance_id>) the IP tables rules are not re-instated when the instance boots, therefore if the rules have previously been deleted, the instance will be brought up without Security Group enforcement. Depending on the deployment architecture, this could breach security assumptions and leave an instance vulnerable to network based attacks. This situation is most likely to arise in cases where the Nova compute service has been terminated or restarted, which removes all iptables rules. ### Recommended Actions ### - Do not to use the soft reboot method to start instances from the stopped state. - If VMs are in the stopped state, boot using ""nova boot <instance>"" or reboot using ""nova reboot --hard"". ### Contacts / References ### This OSSN : https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0022 Original LaunchPad Bug : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1316822 OpenStack Security ML : openstack-security@lists.openstack.org OpenStack Security Group : https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg ",,41,0

Storm is a real time processing framework that is highly used in the big data processing community. Problem description =================== Sahara today is only able to process big data in batch. Storm provides a easy setup stream processing. Having storm integrated with Sahara gives sahara a new feature, so not only users will be able to process batch but also real time data. Proposed change =============== The implementation is devided in three steps: * First we need to implement Storm Plugin. * Identify Storm configuration files and manage their creation via sahara; * Create the plugin itself to manage Storm deploy; * Second, we need to create a new Job Manager for storm, following Trevor McKay's refactoring * Last we will create a new image that comes with storm installed. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Deployer impact --------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Sahara-image-elements impact ---------------------------- None Sahara-dashboard / Horizon impact --------------------------------- The only changes needed here is to show the configuration opetions of Storm when this type of job is selected. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: * tellesmvn Work Items ---------- The implementation is devided in three steps: * First we need to implement Storm Plugin. * Storm plugin is similar to Spark plugin. The implementation will be based on Spark's but necessary changes will be made. * Storm doesn't rely on many configuration files, there is only one needed and it is used by all nodes. This configuration file is written in YAML and it should be dinamically written in the plugin since it needs to have the name or ip of the master node and also zookeeper node(s). From tests I ran in Openstack, Storm needs to have the /etc/hosts files edited with the name of the machines and IP's so it can communicate whitout major problems. * Second, we need to create a new Job Manager for storm, following Trevor McKay's refactoring * This implementation is under review and the details can be seen here: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/100678/ * Last we will create a new image that comes with storm installed. * This part is yet not the final decision, but it seems to me that it is better to have a prepared image with storm than having to install it every time a new cluster is set up. Dependencies ============ * https://review.openstack.org/#/c/100622/ Testing ======= I will write Unit Tests, basically to test the write configuration file and more tests can be added as needed. Documentation Impact ==================== We will need to add Storm as a new plugin in the documentation and write how to use the plugin.

The function '@_wrap_db_error' and '@retry_on_dead_lock',

But it doesn't cover some 'Query' actions.
So, we need to add the same protection for 'all()' in sqlalchemy.

Glance control_exchange in glance-api.conf wasn't set
and glance used default value for this - 'openstack'.
So, exchange 'glance' and queue 'glance' didn't exist in rabbit.
But ceilometer as default glance control exchange uses 'glance'.
This patch fixes the fix for this problem and change-id as well

The glance/cmd/control.py file contains a possible shell injection
vulnerability:

https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/master/glance/cmd/control.py#L134 .

Setting 'shell=True' here opens the possibility of shell injection
by setting server to something like '; rm -rf /'. This will cause
the command 'rm -rf /' to be run with the privileges of the user
that ran Glance.

The fix is to parameterize the input so that the command run here
can only be 'logger'.

Refactored migration tests due to use OpportunisticTestCase, removed
unused code and ``test_migrations.conf`` file.

This change allows tests use database ``openstack_citest`` only
for connection to the database backend. The main feature of this
approach is - for each migration test will be created new database
with random name. This will avoid migration tests of race conditions
and reduce tests intersection.

``test_migrations.conf`` file was removed, because we create test
database for migration test, so we no longer need test database credentials.

Libvirt's LXC implementation exposes a read-only  `/proc/sys/net` to the
guests. This causes some of the guest's default network configuration scripts
to fail.

This patch works-around the issue by using `post-up` hooks to configure IPv6.
