This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================ Cinder volume driver for Pure Storage FlashArray ================================================ Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/pure-iscsi-volume-driver The purpose of this spec is to add a Cinder volume driver for Pure Storage FlashArray. It will support the iSCSI protocol and will include at least the minimum set of features required by the Juno release. We will also set up automated CI testing on an OpenStack cluster maintained by Pure Storage in accordance with the third party CI requirement policy. Pure Storage builds all-flash storage arrays. The active/active controller architecture is based on the Purity Operating Environment and providing an adaptive metadata fabric that is scalable, granular to 512B, and protected. Problem description =================== Currently, the Pure Storage FlashArray cannot be used a block storage backend in an OpenStack environment. Proposed change =============== Add a Pure Storage FlashArray Cinder driver to the OpenStack Cinder package. The Pure Storage driver will leverage a thin Python REST client library. The client library interacts with the REST service hosted on the FlashArray to perform array management and satisfy Cinder driver API requirements. :: Control Flow +------------------+ | Cinder + | | Cinder Volume | +--------+---------+ | v +------------------+ | Pure Driver | | | +--------+---------+ | v +------------------+ | Pure REST Client | | | +--------+---------+ | v +------------------+ | Pure REST Server | | (FlashArray) | +------------------+ The Cinder driver will make use of REST client APIs to support: * Volume Create/Delete * Volume Attach/Detach * Snapshot Create/Delete * Create Volume from Snapshot * Get Volume Stats * Copy Image to Volume * Copy Volume to Image * Clone Volume * Extend Volume In addition to the delivery of the driver implementation, the proposed change includes the addition of unit tests for the driver. Pure Storage will create dedicated Jenkins jobs to support CI and Tempest test execution on a Devstack virtual machine to continuously prove functionality of the driver. Alternatives ------------ None. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- The only security related aspect is that an API token is required by the driver to leverage the REST client and authenticate against the REST API. The API token must be specified in the cinder.conf configuration file. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- The impact of this change is that OpenStack Cinder will have support for using a Pure Storage FlashArray as a backing block storage device. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- The configuration needed to leverage the Pure Storage driver includes: * volume_driver - Specifies the Pure Storage FlashArray driver module. * pure_target - The address of the FlashArray storage target. * pure_api_token - An API token created on the FlashArray to authenticate REST clients, which the driver will make use of. And optionally: * pure_host_name - The name of a host object on the FlashArray to associate with IQNs and volume connections. This defaults to the name ""OpenStack"" if not provided. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: victor-ying <victor.ying@purestorage.com> Other contributors: wes-w <wes@purestorage.com> zach-olstein <zach.olstein@purestorage.com> Work Items ---------- * Complete Cinder Pure Storage driver implementation. * Complete Cinder Pure Storage driver unit tests. * Pass automated Tempest tests to prove functionality. * Integrate Devstack VM and Jenkins job into Pure Storage Jenkins system. Dependencies ============ The driver has a dependency on a REST client library provided by Pure Storage that allows developers to easily build Python applications built on REST API functionality. The library is currently not available as a pip-installable Python package, so the library module will be committed along with the driver implementation. Testing ======= As mentioned in work items, the delivery of the driver will be accompanied by a suite of unit tests for the driver (that use Mock to isolate driver code from the FlashArray). Additionally, continuous integration through Jenkins and automated Tempest test runs are required for the driver to be accepted. Documentation Impact ==================== Pure Storage should be listed as having a supported Cinder driver on the CinderSupportMatrix: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/CinderSupportMatrix References ========== None.

Previously, the integration of DSE, policy, and data sources
was incomplete and buggy.

This change completes and fixes that integration so that we now
have a test where the policy engine interoperates properly with
two (mocked and manually polled) data sources.  In this test,
we simulate the API sending a policy-update message to the policy
engine that mentions two data sources known to the policy engine
(two instances of Neutron).  The policy engine asks DSE to instantiate
drivers for those data sources, and when those datasources are polled
information is properly propagated to the policy engine.

Several changes were necessary (but too intertwined to separate out
into separate commits).

o  Datasources now publish the full contents of each table and
through a pre-publish hook in DSE send only deltas to the policy engine.
This was necessary to ensure that if the policy engine subscribes *after*
the datasource started polling, DSE would be able to send the full contents
of the table as a response to the subscribe message, using its usual mechanism.

o  The policy engine, upon receiving policy updates, ensures its
subscriptions to data sources are up to date (and spins up/down
drivers for data sources as required).

o  Data sources drivers now take an extra argument during initialization:
the python client they should be using.  This is useful for mocking
up data sources during testing.

o  The DSE now has a way to set default values
for arguments given to individual data sources upon creation.  This is
important so that when testing we can ensure those data sources are given
the appropriate mock clients even though the test does not itself directly
instantiate those data services.

o  The policy engine now supports an 'initialize()' routine that
resets the contents of given tables to given values.  Previously,
runtime only supported insert/delete.

o  The different theories now all support a content() function that
returns some combination of data and policy.  Previously, this functionality
was sometimes called contents() and sometimes content().

Due to a timing issue, the network topology page can issue a 500 error
if a subnet is deleted at the inopportune moment.

Inside openstack_dashboard/dashboards/project/network_topology/views.py
---> JSONView.get method:

neutron_networks = api.neutron.network_list_for_tenant(
                request,
                request.user.tenant_id)

This can return a list of network objects whose subnet list can be [None]

Later, we attempt to iterate over that list and pull the .cidr attribute
off each element:

...
                    'subnets': [{'cidr': subnet.cidr}
                                for subnet in network.subnets],
...

Obviously, None doesn't have a .cidr attribute.

The real cause is inside the api.neutron.network_list_for_tenant call
above. Each network's list of subnets should never include None.

Problem description =================== At present, Nova only permits a single VIF from each VM to be attached to a given Neutron network. If you attempt to attach two VIFs to the same network, a '404 Not Found' error is issued, meaning that the second network is not found from the list of networks remaining after the first network is not used. NFV functions occasionally require two interfaces to be attached to a single network from the same VM, for reasons described below in the 'use cases' section. When this is required, the VNF generally cannot be used under Openstack. We propose removing the limitation, which exists in Nova (Neutron has no such limitation), allowing any number of VIFs to be attached to the same network. Use cases ========= VNFs are often large, complex pieces of code, and may be supplied by third parties. For various reasons, it is not uncommon that it is necessary to feed traffic out of an interface and into another interface (when the VNF implements multiple functions and the functions cannot be chained internally) or to feed traffic from e.g. the internet into multiple interfaces to run them through separate processing functions internally. The limitation can be seen as one of the VNF. Clearly, the VNF could be changed to put multiple addresses or functions on a single port (to fix the incoming traffic issue) or to connect functions internally (to fix the passthrough problem. The problem with this solution is that the timescale for getting such a fix is often prohibitive. VNFs are large, complex pieces of code, and often the supplier of the VNF is not the same organisation as that trying to use the VNF within Openstack, necessitating a feature change request which may well not be possible within reasonable timescales. We propose changing the code within Nova to remove this limitation. API changes =========== When the attempt is made to attach two interfaces to a single network, Nova will, instead of returning the 404 error, attach two interfaces to the same network and return a normal success code to the 'nova boot' attempt. Alternatives ------------ It may be possible to work around this limitation by using two ports on the same network and attach the VM to the two ports, rather than the same network twice. This has not been tested. On the other hand, this indicates that the limitation is highly artificial and should, in any case, be removed. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- When the attempt is made to attach two interfaces to a single network, Nova will, instead of returning the 404 error, attach two interfaces to the same network and return a normal success code to the 'nova boot' attempt. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. An end user using API calls that currently succeed will see no change in behaviour in those APIs. This only changes a case where an API currently fails. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ijw-ubuntu Work Items ---------- * Change the Nova code, per the existing abandoned patch in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/26370 - which requires porting forward from the code in question to the current trunk. * Add unit tests, which are missing from the abandoned patch. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= Independently of this spec, tests should be added to Tempest: * minimally, to ensure that traffic can be passed between the two interfaces on a VM created in this fashion * optionally, traffic flow should be tested from another VM or external packet supplier to either of the interfaces. Documentation Impact ==================== The change can be documented, but since the current behaviour is not documented at present no change is actually required.

Currently updates to security group rules or membership
are handled by immediately triggering a call to refresh_firewall.
This call is quite expensive, and it is often executed with a
very high frequency.

With this patch, the notification handler simply adds devices for
which the firewall should be refreshed to a set, which will then
be processed in another routine. The latter is supposed to
be called in the main agent loop.

This patch for 'provider updates' simply sets a flag for refreshing
the firewall for all devices.

In order to avoid breaking other agents leveraging the security
group RPC mixin, the reactive behaviour is still available, and is
still the default way of handling security group updates.

Patching into Havana as this fixes the issue of the agents flapping

The current devstack configuration in the dev documentation
is out of date and will not successfully spin up a
Nova with Ironic driver environment. One of the critical
changes necessary is to set the IRONIC_VM_SPECS_RAM to 1024,
as that is now the minimum size for a virtual Ironic node.

This change also updates the configurations to more closely match
the ones being used for the virtual ironic Devstack job and
explicitly sets file logging to make debugging easier.

 horizon_workflow.scss is currently pretty much css.  There's some
 semi-sophisticated css in there (the arrows) and it would be improved
 with some variable usage and more nesting.

 Based on my previous less-ify here:
 https://review.openstack.org/#/c/82209/

 NOTE: I've verified that the resulting .css file is exactly the same as
 before.

 NOTE 2: Per Maxime's suggestion, I've moved the variable declarations
 into the _variables.scss file, and changed the format of a few of them.
 The resulting .css file is now slightly different but only because
 ""white"" is different from ""#ffffff""

This uses stevedore to load any client plugin extension defined
in the heat.clients namespace in setup.cfg.

As a transition from non-plugin to plugin clients, requesting a
named client will first search for a client plugin, then fallback
to calling the _<name>() method.

Clients plugin initialise is triggered from resources initialise.

This change also adds the clients package for the constraints
plugin manager. Custom constraints often make client API
calls and are not necessarily associated with resources, so
in many cases the client plugin will be a better place for
constraints to live.

Problem description =================== Now there is a lot of copy&paste test code for Nova v2/v3 API tests. In addition, we need to add many checks for API test coverage. As the result, we should apply the same changes to v2 and v3 tests and that becomes much maintenance burden now. Proposed change =============== To improve the maintenancebility, this blueprint proposes the changes to share v2 and v3 API test code. The proposed way is the following three steps. 1. Create common base test class 2. Make each v2 test class inherit the v3 test class 3. Change the Nova API test directory structure 1. Create common base test class -------------------------------- Now each Nova API test class inherits like: * [v2 test class] -> [BaseV2ComputeTest] -> [BaseComputeTest] * [v3 test class] -> [BaseV3ComputeTest] -> [BaseComputeTest] To share API test classes, we need to create common base test class instead of BaseV2ComputeTest/BaseV3ComputeTest. The class instance can switch its behavior based on some variable which represents an API version. After applying this common class to every API test classes, the existing BaseV2ComputeTest and BaseV3ComputeTest can be removed. 2. Make each v2 test class inherit the v3 test class ---------------------------------------------------- We need to change v3 test classes' inheritances to the common base test class and change v2 test classes' inheritances to v3 test class: * [v2 test class] -> [v3 test class] -> [CommonComputeTest] In v2 test class, the variable which represents an API version should be ""2"", and the variable should be ""3"" in v3 test class:: class SomeApiV3Test(CommonComputeTest): _api_version = 3 [..] class SomeApiV2Test(SomeApiV3Test): _api_version = 2 [..] 3. Change the Nova API test directory structure ----------------------------------------------- Current test directory structure is * tempest/api/compute/ : v2 API test files * tempest/api/compute/v3/ : v3 API test files This structure is not understandable, and it is better to move v2 API test files to some directory which shows v2's one clearly. This blueprint proposes to change the structure to * tempest/api/compute/ : common test files * tempest/api/compute/v2/ : v2 API specific test files * tempest/api/compute/v3/ : v3 API specific test files If there is no shared code between the v2 and v3 APIs the inheritance model from (2) won't work. So in these cases the hierarchy will be: * [v2 test class] -> [CommonComputeTest] * [v3 test class] -> [CommonComputeTest] and these test files will be stored directly in: * tempest/api/compute/v2/ * tempest/api/compute/v3/ Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Ken'ichi Ohmichi <oomichi@mxs.nes.nec.co.jp> Other contributors: Ghanshyam Mann <ghanshyam.mann@nectechnologies.in> Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: Juno-2 Work Items ---------- - Add a common class for Nova v2/v3 API tests - Add a common admin class for Nova v2/v3 API tests - Share API test clases This work needs a lot of patchset.

Murano Continious Integration Service ===================================== Murano project has the CI server, which tests all commits for Murano components and allow to verify that new code does not break nothing. Murano CI uses OpenStack QA cloud for testing infrastructure. Murano CI url: 'https://murano-ci.mirantis.com/jenkins/' There are two jobs for each repository: one of them run on Ubuntu, another one on CentOS. Here you can see several Jenkins jobs with different targets: * Jobs ""murano-dashboard-integration-tests-\*"" allow to verify each commit to murano-dashboard repository on different distributive * Jobs ""murano-engine-app-deployment-tests-\*"" allow to verify each commit to murano repository on different distributive Other jobs allow to build and test Murano documentation and perform another usefull work to support Murano CI infrastructure. Murano Automated Tests: UI Tests ================================ Murano project has a Web User Interface and we have the test suite for Murano Web UI. All UI tests are located in the https://github.com/stackforge/murano-dashboard/functionaltests All automated tests for Murano Web UI writen on python using advanced Selenium library, which allow to find Web elements using captions for fields and other information to find elements without/with xpath. How To Run ---------- Prerequisites: ++++++++++++++ * Install nose using **easy_install nose** or **pip install nose** This will install the nose libraries, as well as the nosetests script, which you can use to automatically discover and run tests. * Install external python libraries which are required for Murano Web UI tests: **testtools** and **selenium** Download tests and run: +++++++++++++++++++++++ First of all make sure that additional components are installed. * Clone murano-dashboard git repository: *git clone https://github.com/stackforge/murano-dashboard* * Need to change default settings in functionaltests/config/config_file.conf, set appropriate urls and credentials. :: [common] horizon_url = http://127.0.0.1/horizon murano_url = http://127.0.0.1:8082 user = WebTestUser password = swordfish tenant = WebTestProject keystone_url = http://127.0.0.1:5000/v2.0/ * Go to the ""functionaltests"" directory where tests are stored * A part of tests work with application catalog and upload set of application packages for that. To upload a set of standard packages from special Murano repository need to create and execute following script which clone repository with packages, archive and store them in 'functionaltests' folder: :: git_url=""https://github.com/murano-project/murano-app-incubator"" clone_dir=""murano-app-incubator"" git clone $git_url $clone_dir cd $clone_dir for package_dir in io.murano.* do if [ -d ""$package_dir"" ]; then if [ -f ""${package_dir}/manifest.yaml"" ]; then sudo bash make-package.sh $package_dir fi fi done * All preparation are done. * All tests are grouped for a few suites, to specify which tests/suite to run, pass test/suite names on the command line: * to run all tests: *nosetests sanity_check.py* * to run one suite: *nosetests sanity_check.py:<test suite name>* * to run one test: *nosetests sanity_check.py:<test suite name>.<test name>* In case of SUCCESS you should see something like this: ......................... Ran 34 tests in 1.440s OK There are also a number of command line options that can be used to control the test execution and generated outputs. For help with nosetests’ many command-line options, try: *nosetests -h* Murano Automated Tests: Tempest Tests ===================================== All Murano services have tempest-based automated tests, which allow to verify API interfaces and deployment scenarious. Tempest tests for Murano are located in the: https://github.com/stackforge/murano/tree/master/functionaltests The following Python files are contain basic tests suites for different Murano components. Tests on API which running on devstack gate can be founded here https://github.com/stackforge/murano/tree/master/functionaltests/api * test_murano_envs.py contains test suite with actions on murano's environments(create, delete, get and etc.) * test_murano_sessions.py contains test suite with actions on murano's sessions(create, delete, get and etc.) * test_murano_services.py contains test suite with actions on murano's services(create, delete, get and etc.) * test_murano_repository.py contains test suite with actions on murano's package repository Tests on engine which running on murano-ci : https://github.com/stackforge/murano/tree/master/functionaltests/engine * base.py contains base test class and tests with actions on deploy murano's services If you want to know, what steps this test does, you can see test's scenario in code. For example: :: @attr(type='smoke') def test_get_environment(self): """""" Get environment by id Test create environment, afterthat test try to get environment's info, using environment's id, and finally delete this environment Target component: Murano Scenario: 1.

Now we have the token info available in the request context, we can
avoid always re-requesting another token every time a client is
created.

This should be better for performance as it avoids one extra request to
keystone, and it also enables trust-scoped tokens to be more easily
used, since these cannot be used to request another token, thus
authentication will fail with the current scheme.

Murano simple test usually fails on ubuntu,
because if image doesn't cached by glance
creating instance with murano image takes a long time,
this time are greater than test's timeout.
Add instance creation before running murano ostf test,
it allows to cache image in glance before running tests.

Manila uses oslo-incubator/rpc as an RPC library.
During Havana, oslo/rpc was cleaned up and moved into
oslo.messaging with a more stable and well-defined API.

oslo-incubator/rpc considered as deprecated and should be
replaced with oslo.messaging in Manila.

Sum changes:

* New dependency oslo.messaging>=1.3.0 is required

* The new rpc module has init() and cleanup() methods which manage the
global oslo.messaging transport state. The TRANSPORT and NOTIFIER
globals are conceptually similar to the current RPCIMPL global,
except we're free to create and use alternate Transport objects.

* The rpc.get_{client,server,notifier}() methods are just helpers
which wrap the global messaging state, specifiy serializers and
specify the use of the eventlet executor.

* In oslo.messaging, a request context is expected to be a dict, so
RequestContextSerializer was added which can serialize to and from
dicts using RequestContext.{to,from}_dict()

* The allowed_rpc_exception_modules configuration option is replaced
by an allowed_remote_exmods get_transport() parameter. This is not
something that users ever need to configure, but it is something
each project using oslo.messaging needs to be able to customize.

* We maintain a global NOTIFIER object and create specializations of
it with specific publisher IDs in order to avoid notification driver
loading overhead.

* rpc.py contains transport aliases for backwards compatibility
purposes. setup.cfg also contains notification driver aliases for
backwards compat.

* messaging.ConfFixture is used in tests to override oslo.messaging
config options, rather than making assumptions about the options
registered by the library.

The logged error in bug #1328983 occurs in the following scenario:
* single heat-engine (so no multi-engine locking paths are invoked)
* multiple stack deletes on the same stack
* when the threads are stopped from a previous delete call so
  that the new delete call can acquire the lock and do the delete

This change does an eventlet sleep before forcefully stopping
the thread when taking over a delete from a different
thread. This gives the previous delete thread an opportunity to
finish naturally.

This may not prevent the error in bug #1328983 from ever
being logged in a production environment, but it is an internal error
which does not propagate to the user. This change should however
prevent this error from being logged during a tempest run, and the
original gate failure was due to ERROR log entry detection rather
than actual failing tests.

By experimentation the timeout of 0.2s was chosen. The error in
bug #1328983 started being logged again when the timeout was
reduced to 0.02s

Problem description =================== There is a workaround in Icehouse when a compute service is automatic disbled when hypervisor is temporary not available. A 'AUTO:' is added to disabled_reason column to indicate that the service is automatically disabled. This might not be a very good from operator perspective and operator who deliberatly add 'AUTO:' as prefix might lead to problem. And for libvirt, sometimes the libvirt is temporary not available and it can be back to work after a while, we need to retry the connection to libvirt to make sure whether we can restore the connection or not. https://review.openstack.org/#/c/86869/ has more information for this bp Proposed change =============== Add a column into service table named 'auto_disabled' with boolean. Add a column into service object, whenever we load a Service object, look for the AUTO:, set auto_disabled=True, and strip out the AUTO: Then, over time, the data will be migrated, but we won't have to do it during the migration. whenever we find the libvirt connection has problem, we can retry to connect for several times (5 by default), then if we still can't connect to libvirt, it will be automatically disabled. Alternatives ------------ we might keep the service table as before, as problem section described, it might affect operator. if we don't have reconnection mechanism, we might need to wait for long time in order to wait host compute up again. Data model impact ----------------- In service object, one column will be added: fields = { 'id': fields.IntegerField(), ..... 'disabled_reason': fields.StringField(nullable=True), 'availability_zone': fields.StringField(nullable=True), 'compute_node': fields.ObjectField('ComputeNode'), + 'auto_disabled': fields.BooleanField(), } In service table schema, one column will be added: class Service(BASE, NovaBase): .... report_count = Column(Integer, nullable=False, default=0) disabled = Column(Boolean, default=False) disabled_reason = Column(String(255)) + auto_disabled = Column(Boolean(create_constraint=False), default=False) As proposed change section indicates, no need to do off-line db migration since we are able to translate previous db record when we load them.

We have an increasing number of attributes which are a list of strings.

In HOT there is no way to join a list into a string as with the CFN
function Fn::Join.

This change implements HOT intrinsic function list_join using an
identical implementation as Fn::Join.

Tripleo will benefit from this function since the lack of a join
function in HOT is one of the barriers to transitioning to the
HOT template format.

Multiple dependent blueprint specifications are being worked on that will provide the granular details on each component in this framework. This document will not go into the those details. The design and plan proposed here is based on the discussions in the advanced services weekly IRC meetings [1], discussions in the mailing list, and during the Havana and Icehouse design summit sessions. Problem description =================== Neutron, as of the Icehouse release, supports three advanced services - Firewall (FWaaS), Loadbalancer (LBaaS), and VPN (VPNaaS) in addition to the core L2 and L3 functionality (the latter has also been factored into a pluggable advanced service implementation). Each of these advanced services is either inserted implicitly into the tenant topology or explicitly associated with a neutron router. However, there is no generic service insertion mechanism to facilitate L3, L2, bump-in-the-wire, and tap insertion modes. Moreover, with more than one service, it becomes relevant to explore the model of how multiple services can be sequenced in a chain. An example, in the context of today’s reference implementations, is the insertion and chaining of Firewall and VPN services. Each of these reference implementations rely on the use of IPTables chains to program the relevant filters and policies to achieve their respective functions. However, in the absence of a chaining abstraction to express the sequence of these services, these implementations act independently and the resulting order of operations is incidental and cannot be controlled. The goal of this Advanced Services Common Framework is to support the publishing, instantiation, insertion, and chaining of network services in Neutron. Proposed change =============== The framework needs to support and reconcile the following dimensions: * Different service: - types (e.g. LB, FW, VPN), - capabilities of a service type (e.g. transparent FW versus edge FW), - levels of a service type (e.g. number of policy rules supported on the FW, and perhaps captured in abstract as gold, service, bronze, etc service levels) * Different service manifestations: - hardware appliance - virtual (VM) appliance - host operating system configuration (e.g. IPTables) - an independent OS process (e.g. HAProxy) * Single service insertion * Chaining of services (linear and graphs) * Backends supporting combination of services in the same physical or virtual appliance * Requirements of higher level declarative abstractions like Group Policy * Feasible open source reference implementation * Backward compatibility (perhaps not as relevant since FWaaS and VPNaaS are still experimental, and LBaaS is going through a major redesign) The framework consists of the following building blocks: **Flavors framework [2]** The Flavors framework allows the operator to publish the available service types and their capabilities. It hides the provider details of the service from its user. **Service definition [3]** Each Neutron service needs to implement a common base service definition. This defines operations that support the life cycle management of a service instance of that service and provide for: * setting the flavor of the service instance * inserting the service in the data path * discovering the service **Service insertion [4]** Allows the user to request that a particular service be available at a certain point in the user’s logical topology. Once inserted, the service becomes part of the data path defined by the regular L2/L3 behavior. Example: a Neutron router is inserted by creating an interface on a subnet. **Traffic steering [5]** A lower level imperative abstraction which allows specifying that traffic be steered between an ordered list of Neutron ports. The traffic can be further subject to L2/L3 classification criteria. This abstraction can be leveraged to realize service chaining, and is particularly helpful in chaining services that are not known to Neutron and only manifest as Neutron ports (e.g. a user managed service VM). **Service Chain [6]** This is a declarative abstraction that allows specifying an ordered list/graph of Neutron services types. The underlying implementation for that chain performs insertion of each service in the chain, and the steering of traffic between the services in the specified order. The implementation may choose to leverage the traffic steering primitives mentioned earlier.

Some default values for configuration options are dynamic and
environment dependent. For example, an option might default to the
hostname of the machine.

However, such default values should never end up in a sample
configuration file - you don't want your hostname or path to your
personal home directory to be included in sample config files.

A simple solution to this is to add a 'sample_default' string
attribute which is used in place of a default, for those cases where
the real value is an unsuitable sample default. For example:

  cfg.StrOpt('hostname',
             default=get_my_host(),
             sample_default='myhostname')

In this case a mock of `time.time` will cause many more calls due to the usage it in the logging module. A usage of such a mock should be avoided. A workaround is to overload the `_fake_logs` function in a base class but this will deactivate fake logging globally.,,12,0

This change presents one way we might include test support
for oslo.db against specific SQLAlchemy major releases, currently
including the 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 series.  As we will want to
begin including features within oslo.db that target advanced
and in some cases semi-public APIs within SQLAlchemy, it will
be important that we test these features against each major release,
as there may be variances between major revs as well as
version-specific approaches within oslo.

To accomplish this, I was not able to override ""deps"" alone,
as the SQLAlchemy revision within requirements.txt conflicts
with a hand-entered requirement, and due to pip's lack of
a dependency resolver (see https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/988
and https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/56) I instead overrode
""commands"".  I don't know that this is the best approach, nor
do I know how the tox.ini file is accommodated by CI servers,
if these CI servers would need their tox invocation altered or
how that works.

This patch may or may not be the way to go, but in any case
I'd like to get input on how we can ensure that more SQLAlchemy-specific
oslo.db features can be tested against multiple SQLAlchemy versions.
Note that even with this change, running the ""sqla_07"" environment
does in fact produce test failures, see http://paste.openstack.org/show/85263/;

PCI device need to be scheduled according the resource status. The PCI
tracker provoides central contorl of the PCI resouces.

Discovered PCI devices are passed to the PCI tracker to track their status,
and to provide functions for compute node components to update, check, claim
the PCI devices resources.

PCI Tracker also updates PCI stats which provide infomation to the scheduler.

A VO is a group of users from different organisations who collaborate together to share resources. Different users who need to be granted the same access rights to a set of VO resources are assigned the same VO role. This API allows administrators to create, read, update and delete secret protected VO roles and users to self register to and resign from these VO roles. VO roles are mapped into OpenStack groups as follows: 1. If the VO is a domain, the group name is the VO role name 2. If there are multiple VOs in a domain, the group name is vo_name.vo_role ### VO roles: `/OS-FEDERATION/vo_roles` ### VO role membership: `/OS-FEDERATION/vo_roles/member` Admin API on VO roles --------------------- ### Create a VO role: `PUT /OS-FEDERATION/vo_roles` Required Attributes: - `vo_name` (string) The name of the virtual organisation. - 'vo_role' (string) The name of the virtual organisation role. - `secret` (string) The secret to be presented by users to register for this VO role. Optional attributes: - `description` (string) Describes the virtual organisation. If a value is not specified by the client, the service will default this value to`null`. - `enabled` (boolean) Indicates whether this VO role is active or not. If a value is not specified by the client, the service will default this to `true`. - `vo_is_domain` (boolean) Indicates whether this VO is its own domain or not. If a value is not specified, the service will default this to 'false'. - `automatic_join`(boolean) Indicates if an administrator must enable user accounts after registration. If a value is not specified by the client, the service will default this to `false`.

Recently it was observed that with large numbers of volumes
that things like ""cinder list"" could take extremely long to
return.

For example, running cinder list on a system with 1000 volumes took
greater than 30 seconds to return.  It turns out that the cause of
this is the addition of visible admin_metadata.

There's two problems with this:
1. The original patch probably shouldn't have gone in
   data is either admin data or it's not, selectively picking
   pieces of admin data out to provide to the user just creates
   complications and introduces confusion.
2. The REAL issue here is that since the standar gets are made
   with the standard user context, the add_visible_admin_metadata
   would go through and do an elevated context get on every single
   volume individually.  This is what caused the horrible performance
   issue on cinder list with large numbers of volumes.

Running as admin, or removing the second call drops this down to about 3
seconds for the same 1000 volume list.

This patch removes the secondary admin context get_call.  Instead where
we expect to do display the visible admin_meta, we pass in a flag
requesting that the volume object we're getting has the appropriate
metadata.  This way we can elevate the context if needed and avoid
iterating through the gets again.

This patch also cleans up the get_visible_admin_meta methods, and
consolidates both V1 and V2 to use the utils method.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================================================= Schedule actions to call after database transaction is closed ============================================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/schedule-actions-for-db-transaction-closed Neutron suffers from intermittent OperationalErrors due to database lock timeouts that are triggered by incorrect switch of green threads while under database transaction. Those switches are usually triggered by RPC notifications invoked deep in the stack of calls to handle requests. This spec is to introduce a general mechanism to schedule arbitrary actions from under database transaction to be called after the current transaction is closed. Problem description =================== In Neutron, we experience lots of db lock timeout issues like: * https://launchpad.net/bugs/1330955 * https://launchpad.net/bugs/1332577 * https://launchpad.net/bugs/1330638 * https://launchpad.net/bugs/1330639 * https://launchpad.net/bugs/1330644 Those failures are triggered by eventlet green thread switched while under transaction and a row in db being locked. The thread is switched to another thread that tries to access the same (locked) row, it locks waiting for the object to be released, and this results in timeout and failure to process request. Green thread switch does not occur randomly, it's triggered by eventlet when calling to specific (monkey patched) methods from stdlib. This includes network operations. One common problem in Neutron is that we may be interested in sending a notification as a result of an operation. Such notification may result in green thread switch. This is fine as long as we notify from outside any active transaction. Most of the code is written with this assumption, as follows:: def example_method(self, context, ...): with context.session.begin(subtransactions=True): ... do db work ... ... send notification ... This approach is fine as long as the method called from no-transaction context. It then guarantees that notifications are sent after transaction created by the method is closed. The problem arises when the same code is called from another method that opens transaction. In that case, notifier is called from db context (even though the author of the called method didn't mean it), and then a failure may occur. Examples of the methods that are currently invoked from under transactions and may switch green threads are: * neutron/api/rpc/agentnotifiers/l3_rpc_agent_api.py: * L3AgentNotifyAPI.routers_updated * L3AgentNotifyAPI.router_deleted * L3AgentNotifyAPI.router_removed_from_agent * L3AgentNotifyAPI.router_added_to_agent * neutron/agent/securitygroups_rpc.py: * SecurityGroupAgentRpcApiMixin.security_groups_rule_updated * SecurityGroupAgentRpcApiMixin.security_groups_member_updated * SecurityGroupAgentRpcApiMixin.security_groups_provider_updated Note: the list above is not meant to be complete. Proposed change =============== Instead of calling to a notifier directly from notify_* methods, we should schedule them to be executed once database session is indeed closed. This means adding a new schedule_action_on_db_close method that will receive a function and its arguments. This new method will require access to database session object, so it will be defined as a session object method. Developers will be able to invoke the new method from both transaction context and outside of it. In the latter case, schedule_action_on_db_close will invoke the function passed as an argument right away. Scheduled actions with their arguments will be stored in a list attached to context.session. Scheduled actions will be called from context.session.begin __exit__ method that is invoked once we leave current subtransaction. If __exit__ detects that it's the root method that opened transaction, and after it actually closes it, it will run thru the list of scheduled actions and call them. Currently, session object represents a pure sqlalchemy Session object. We will need to apply modifications to it (adding the list of scheduled actions, extending __exit__, ...), so we will need to introduce a new subclass. The name proposed for the new type is: NeutronSession. The last step is to modify all the code that currently calls to notifier directly to use the new schedule_action_on_db_close method. Once done, we may consider removing some of the explicit locks set previously for suspicious methods. F.e. see neutron/plugins/ml2/plugin.py:delete_port:: def delete_port(self, context, ...): ... # REVISIT: Serialize this operation with a semaphore to prevent # undesired eventlet yields leading to 'lock wait timeout' errors with contextlib.nested(lockutils.lock('db-access'), session.begin(subtransactions=True)): ... Alternatives ------------ One of the alternative approaches is to put burden of issuing notifications to the caller, as in: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/100934/ The problem with that approach is that it mixes implementation details with API, exposing notification internals to callers that should not be interested in a way that notifications are handled by the called function. While there is still a value for patching the code for most common db lock timeouts until a more general approach is implemented, we need to find another way to handle those situations long term. Another way to handle that is to thoroughly rework the way we nestedly call methods. This approach could be time consuming and maybe even turn out to be impossible to achieve in current code base. Since we already suffer from those failures, and we need to have a general fix for those issues this cycle, this option is not considered as realistic. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- Currently, notifications are invoked right at the moment they are requested. If some failure occurs later, and current database transaction is rolled back, notifications are already sent to the wire. This looks like incorrect thing to do. Instead, we should send notifications only after we're sure all the relevant database changes are flushed. That's why the new mechanism won't call any scheduled actions if an exception occurs. We should strive to retain the order of notifications while flushing the list of scheduled actions on database transaction close. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ If any, the change should enhance performance once we get rid of unneeded explicit database locks. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- Developers will be required to use the new mechanism to schedule actions that may result in eventlet yield. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ihar-hrachyshka Work Items ---------- #. Introduce a new NeutronSession class, with the new mechanism for scheduled actions implemented. Make sure it's returned when retriving context.session. #. Migrate all calls to a notifier that can be invoked from under transaction to using the new schedule_action_on_db_close method. #. Remove all explicit database locks from plugins that are obsolete by the change. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= Since this is an internal rework that doesn't change system behaviour, current test suite should cover the change. If any unit tests expect a notifier to be called while transaction is not closed yet, we'll need to rewrite them not to expect specific mutual order of database transaction close and notifications. New unit tests will be added to check that the new scheduled actions' mechanism works as expected (retaining the order of notifications, not missing any of them, not calling scheduled actions in case of failure etc.) Documentation Impact ==================== Development documentation should be updated to cover new mechanism for notifications. References ========== None. ",,241,0

Cherry-pick from https://review.openstack.org/#/c/104433/

The messagebus service is renamed dbus in Fedora. As such the
instructions have been updated to provide both the RHEL/CentOS
and Fedora variants.

Examples of the service/chkconfig commands were not switched to
systemctl in this change as service/chkconfig remains used
consistently across the guide at this time and works on both
RHEL/CentOS-based and Fedora distributions.

spawn() guards against multiple threads simultaneously attempting to
cache the same image, but it wasn't guarding against them
simultanously trying to create a resized copy in the cache. Attempting
to create a large number of images simultaneously of an uncached image
would result in a race to create the resized image. This resulted in 2

1. Instances whose disk was a linked clone of a copy which had been
   subsequently overwritten. These were corrupt.
2. Instances whose spawn() failed in ExtendVirtualDisk_Task due to a

This patch creates a Nova-local lock for the resized image. The image
is in a per-Nova directory on the datastore, so inter-Nova locking is
not a concern. The lock guards both testing for the existence of the
image, and its creation. Therefore when multiple processes race, only
1 will create the resized copy, and all others will find and use it.
In normal usage this will add the overhead of an additional
uncontended local lock creation and deletion in spawn().

In wrapping this code in a lock, we also make certain that any failure
to create the resized image is appropriately cleaned up. Otherwise
subsequent users will attempt to use a corrupt copy.

For IPv6 subnets, router RA rule is added to compute node
to allow VM to accept RA from router interface on network node.
However, currently this is only done when router port which
sends RA is created *before* VM port is created.

This fix triggers provider security group rule update for IPv6 subnet
when router interface port is created or updated.

To be able to create profiling traces for Keystone, client should be
able to send special HTTP header that contains trace info.
This patch is as well important to be able to make cross project
traces. (Typical case nova calls keystone via python client, if
profiler is initialized in nova, keystone client will add extra
header, that will be parsed by special osprofiler middleware in keystone
api)

Don't worry no security issue here, trace information is signed by HMAC
key that is setted in api-paste.ini. So only person that knows HMAC key
is able to send proper header.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================================== Enhance floating IP router lookup to consider extra routes ========================================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/floating-ip-extra-route Allow assigning a floating IP to a port that is not directly connected to the router (a port on the ``internal-net`` in the diagram below). Example setup:: +––––––––––+ +–––––––+ +––––––––––––––––+ +–––––––+ +––––––––––––+ |public-net+––+router1+––+intermediate-net+––+router2+––+internal-net+––+ +––––––––––+ +–––––––+ +––––––––––––––––+ +–––––––+ +––––––––––––+ Problem description =================== When a floating IP is associated with an internal address, there is a verification that the internal address is reachable from the router. Currently it only considers internal addresses that are directly connected to the router, and does not allow association to internal addresses that are reachable by routes over intermediate networks. An example use case would be a setup where a compute instance that implemets a multi-homed gateway and functions as a VPN or firewall gateway protecting an internal network. In this setup the port of an ``internal-net`` server to which we wish to assign a floating IP will not be considered reachable, even if there exists an extra route to it on ``router1``. Proposed change =============== Extend the verification to allow the floating IP association if the internal address belongs to a network that is reachable by an extra route, over other gateway devices (such as routers, or multi-homed compute instances). Iterate over routers belonging to the same tenant as the ``internal-net``, and select routers that have an extra route that matches the fixed IP on the ``internal-net`` port which is the target of the floating IP assignment. Sort the candidate routers according to the specificity of the route (most specific route is first). Use the router with the most specific route for the floating IP assignment. Alternatives ------------ None. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. There is validation that the router that is selected for the floating IP assignement belongs to the same tenant as the internal port that is the target for the floating IP assignment. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ The perfomance impact is expected to be minimal. The added router verification code runs only over routers that belong to the same tenant as the ``internal-net`` port. For each such router that has an extra route that matches the internal address, there will be an extra query to validate that the router is indeed on the ``public-net``. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. The change enables floating IP assignment in network topologies, where it was not possible in the past. As such, it will not affect existing deployments. Developer impact ---------------- Plugins that override L3_NAT_db_mixin._get_router_for_floatingip() should be modified to call L3_NAT_db_mixin._find_routers_via_routes_for_floatingip() and iterate over the resulting list of routers. The iteration should apply any plugin specific requirements and select an appropriate router from the list. (The blueprint implementation already contains this change for neutron/plugins/nec/nec_router.py). Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: https://launchpad.net/~ofer-w Other contributors: https://launchpad.net/~zegman Work Items ---------- Enhance floating IP router lookup: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/55987/ Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= A new unit test: neutron.tests.unit.test_extension_extraroute: ExtraRouteDBTestCaseBase.test_floatingip_reachable_by_route() will be added to define the topology in the example setup diagram above. It will test the association of a floating IP to the internal network, including tenant ID match and multiple fixed IPs for the internal network. Documentation Impact ==================== None.

Change has no unit tests partly because it's fairly trivial

The current structure must be baffling for new template authors.

First is a section on Environments, which is actually an advanced
topic. Then is a section on cfn compatible functions which users
should be spurning in favour of HOT intrinisic functions.

The actual docs on how to write a HOT template and the HOT spec
is buried at the end.

This change remedies this state of affairs by moving the
Heat Orchestration Template (HOT) Guide to the start, followed by
the HOT spec.

The Environments section is now after the resource types, and the
Functions section has been renamed CloudFormation Compatible
Functions.

How we document CloudFormation coverage probably needs to be
rethought, but that is beyond the scope of this change.

is consists of several smaller pools with totally different capabilities
and capacities.  Such gap can cause 'strange' issue - a backend appears
to have enough capacity to create a copy of a volume but the backend fails
to do so.  Extending Cinder to support storage pools within volume backend

Such gap can cause 'strange' issue - a backend appears to have enough capacity to create a copy of a volume but the backend fails to do so. Extending Cinder to support storage pools within volume backend will not only solve issues like that, it can also make Cinder's scheduling decision smarter as it now knows full set of capabilities of a backend. Problem description =================== Cinder has been designed to take look each volume backend as a whole since day 1. The provisioning decisions are based on the statistics reported by backends. Any backend is assumed to be a single discrete unit with a set of capabilities and single capacity. In reality this assumption is not true for many storage providers and as their storage can be further divided or partitioned into 'pools' to offer completely different set of capabilities and capacities. That is there are storage backends are a combination of storage pools rather than one big single homogenous entity. Usually volumes/snapshots can't be placed across pools on such backends. As a result, there are obvious problems when using them with current Cinder: 1. A volume/snapshot that is larger than any sub-pool of the target backend be schedule the backend would fail; 2. A sub pool may not have enough space to serve consecutive request (e.g. volume clones, snapshots) while the entire backend appears to have sufficient capacity; These issues are very confusing and result in inconsistent user experience. Therefore it is important to extend Cinder so that it is aware of storage pools within backend and also use them as finest granularity for resource placement. Proposed change =============== We'd like to introduces pool-aware scheduler to address the need for supporting multiple pools from one storage controller. Terminology ----------- Pool - A logical concept to describe a set of storage resource that can be used to serve core Cinder requests, e.g. volumes/snapshots. This notion is almost identical to Cinder Volume Backend, for it has simliar attributes (capacity, capability). The main difference is Pool couldn't exist on its own, it must reside in a Volume Backend. One Volume Backend can have mulitple Pools but Pools don't have sub-Pools (meaning even they have, sub-Pools don't get to exposed to Cinder, yet). Pool has a uniqueue name in backend namespace, which means Volume Backend can't have two pools using same name. Design ------ The workflow in this change is simple: 1) Volume Backends reports how many pools and what those pools look like and are capable of to scheduler; 2) When request comes in, scheduler picks a pool that fits the need most to serve the request, it passes the request to the backend where the target pool resides in; 3) Volume driver gets the message and let the target pool to serve the request as scheduler instructed. To support placing resources (volume/snapshot) onto a pool, these changes will be made to specific components of Cinder: 1. Volume Backends reporting capacity/capabilities at pool level; 2. Scheduler filtering/weighing based on pool capacity/capability and placing volumes/snapshots to a pool of certain backend; 3. Record which pool a resource is located on a backend and passes between scheduler and volume backend. Alternatives ------------ Rather than changing scheduler, Navneet Singh has proposed an alterntive change to make changes to Volume Manger/Driver code. In his approach, each sub-pool of a backend will be exposed as a service entity (e.g. a greenthread inside of a python process), which listens to its own RPC channel, reports its own stats to scheduler. Related bp for this alternative: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/multiple-service-pools Data model impact ----------------- No DB schema change involved, however, the 'host' field of Volumes table will now include pool information but no DB migration is needed. Original Volumes' host field: HostX@BackendY With this change: HostX@Backend:pool0 REST API impact --------------- N/A Security impact --------------- N/A Notifications impact -------------------- Host attribute of volumes now includes 'pool' information in it, consumer of notification can now extend to extract pool information if needed. Other end user impact --------------------- No impact visible to end user. Performance Impact ------------------ The size of RPC message for each volume stats report will be bigger than before (linear to # of pools a backend has). It shouldn't really impact the RPC facility in terms of performance and even if it did, pure text compression should easily mitigate this problem. Other deployer impact --------------------- No special requirement for deployer to deploy new version of Cinder as it is mostly transparent changes even to deployer. The only visible change is the additional pool info encoded into host attribute of volume records. Scheduler is better to be updated/deployed *piror* volume services, but this order is not mandatory. Developer impact ---------------- For those volume backends would like expose internal pools to Cinder for more flexibility, developer should update their drivers to include all sub-pool capacities and capabilities in the volume stats it reports to scheduler. Below is an example of new stats message: { 'volume_backend_name': 'Local iSCSI', #\ 'vendor_name': 'OpenStack', # backend level 'driver_version': '1.0', # mandatory/fixed 'storage_protocol': 'iSCSI', #- stats&capabilities 'active_volumes': 10, #\ 'IOPS_provisioned': 30000, # optional custom 'fancy_capability_1': 'eat', # stats & capabilities 'fancy_capability_2': 'drink', #/ 'pools': [ {'pool_name': '1st pool', #\ 'total_capacity_gb': 500, # mandatory stats for 'free_capacity_gb': 230, # pools 'allocated_capacity_gb': 270, # | 'QoS_support': 'False', # | 'reserved_percentage': 0, #/ 'dying_disks': 100, #\ 'super_hero_1': 'spider-man', # optional custom 'super_hero_2': 'flash', # stats & capabilities 'super_hero_3': 'neoncat' #/ }, {'pool_name': '2nd pool', 'total_capacity_gb': 1024, 'free_capacity_gb': 1024, 'allocated_capacity_gb': 0, 'QoS_support': 'False', 'reserved_percentage': 0, 'dying_disks': 200, 'super_hero_1': 'superman', 'super_hero_2': ' ', 'super_hero_2': 'Hulk', } ] } Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: zhiteng-huang (winston-d) Other contributors: <launchpad-id or None> Work Items ---------- There are two parts of changes needed for this proposal: changes to Cinder itself (scheduler, volume manager) and changes to Cinder drivers for those backends which would like to expose pools to scheduler. But even without Cinder drivers' changes, it will work fine as usual without problem since first part of change has taken compatibility in to account. Dependencies ============ N/A Testing ======= A complete set of testing environment will need following scenarios: 1) Cinder uses backend doesn't support pool (only exposes single pool for entire backend); 2) Cinder uses backend supports pools (with updated driver); 3) Cinder uses mixed backends; Create a few volumes/snapshots on the backends prior upgrades, this is for compatibility tests. For each scenario, tests should be done in 3 steps: 1) Update cinder-scheduler (or cinder-volume), test create volume clones, snapshots of existing volumes or delete existing volumes; 2) Test create new volumes; 3) Update the rest part of Cinder (if cinder-scheduler is updated in step 1, update cinder-volume now, or vise versa), test create volume, create clones, snapshots of existing volumes or delete existing volumes. Documentation Impact ==================== No documentation impact for changes in Cinder itself. But drivers' changes may introduce new configure options which leads to DocImpact.

This will improve the performance of guest workloads by improves TLB cache efficiency. It will effectively create the concept of ""dedicated RAM"" guest instances. Problem description =================== Most modern virtualization hosts support a variety of memory page sizes. On x86 the smallest, used by the kernel by default, is 4kb, while large sizes include 2MB and 1GB. The CPU TLB cache has a limited size, so when there is a very large amount of RAM present and utilized, the cache efficiency can be fairly low which in turn increases memory access latency. By using larger page sizes, there are fewer entries needed in the TLB and thus its efficiency goes up. The use of huge pages for backing guests implies that the guest is running with a dedicated resource allocation. ie the concept of memory overcommit is no longer possible to provide. This is a tradeoff that many workloads are willing to make since they require predictable memory access times. While large pages are better than small pages, it can't be assumed that the benefit increases as the page size increases. In some workloads, a 2 MB page size can be better overall than 1 GB page sizes. Also the choice of page size affects the granularity of guest RAM size. ie a 1.5 GB guest would not be able to use 1 GB pages since RAM is not a multiple of the page size. Large pages must typically be reserved on boot of the compute node by the administrator. Proposed change =============== The flavour extra specs will be enhanced to support a new parameter * hw_mem:page_size=large|small|any|2MB|1GB In absence of any page size setting in the flavour, the current behaviour of using the small, default, page size will continue. A setting of 'large' says to only use larger page sizes for guest RAM; 'small' says to only use the small page sizes (and is the default); 'any' means to try to use larger page sizes, but fallback to using small page sizes if unavailable. Alternatively an explicit page size can be set to choose between the different large page sizes. The libvirt driver will be enhanced to honour this parameter when configuring the guest RAM allocation policy. This will effectively introduce the concept of a ""dedicated memory"" guest, since huge pages must be 1-to-1 associated with guests - there's not facility to over commit by allowing one huge page to be used with multiple guests. The libvirt driver will be enhanced to report on huge page availability per NUMA node, building on previously added NUMA topology reporting. The schedular will be enhanced to take account of the page size setting on the flavour and pick hosts which have sufficient huge pages available when scheduling the instance. Conversely if huge pages are not requested, then the scheduler needs to avoid placing the instance on a host which has pre-reserved huge pages. Alternatives ------------ Recent Linux hosts have a concept of ""transparent huge pages"" where the kernel will opportunistically allocate large pages for guest VMs. The problem with this is that over time, the kernel's memory allocations get very fragmented making it increasingly hard to find contiguous blocks of RAM to use for large pages. This makes transparent huge pages impractical for use with 1 GB page sizes. The opportunistic approach also means that users do not have any hard guarantee that their instance will be backed by huge pages. Data model impact ----------------- No impact. The new data items are stored in the existing flavour extra specs data model and in the host state metadata model. REST API impact --------------- No impact. The existing APIs already support arbitrary data in the flavour extra specs. Security impact --------------- No impact. Notifications impact -------------------- No imapct. The notifications system is not used by this change. Other end user impact --------------------- There are no changes that directly impact the end user, other than the fact that their guest should have more predictable memory access latency. Performance Impact ------------------ The scheduler will have more logic added to take into account huge page availability per NUMA node when placing guests. Most of this impact will have already been incurred when initial NUMA support was added to the schedular. This change is merely altering the NUMA support such that it considers the free huge pages instead of overall RAM size. Other deployer impact --------------------- The cloud administrator will gain the ability to set huge page policy on the flavours they configured. The administrator will also have to configure their compute hosts to reserve huge pages at boot time, and place those hosts into a group using aggregates. Developer impact ---------------- If other hypervisors allow the control over huge page usage, they could be enhanced to support the same flavour extra specs settings. If the hypervisor has self-determined control over huge page usage, then it is valid to simply ignore this new flavour setting. ie do nothing. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: berrange Other contributors: ndipanov Work Items ---------- * Enhance libvirt driver to report available huge pages per NUMA node in the host state data * Enhance libvirt driver to configure guests based on the flavour parameter for page sizes * Add support to scheduler to place instances on hosts according to the availability of required huge pages Dependencies ============ * Virt driver guest NUMA node placement & topology https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/virt-driver-numa-placement * Libvirt / KVM need to be enhanced to allow Nova to indicate that huge pages should be allocated from specific NUMA nodes on the host. This is not a blocker to supporting huge pages in Nova, since it can use the more general huge page support in libvirt, however, the performance benefits won't be fully realized until per-NUMA node huge page allocation can be done. Testing ======= Testing this in the gate would be difficult since the hosts which run the gate tests would have to be pre-configured with huge pages allocated at initial OS boot time. This in turn would preclude running gate tests with guests that do not want to use huge pages. Documentation Impact ==================== The new flavour parameter available to the cloud administrator needs to be documented along with recommendations about effective usage. The docs will also need to mention the compute host deployment pre-requisites such as the need to pre-allocate huge pages at boot time and setup aggregates.

At runtime, it will be resolved to the value of an attribute of a resource instance created from the respective resource definition of the template. The syntax of the get_attr function is as follows: :: get_attr: - <resource ID> - <attribute name> - <key/index 1> (optional) - <key/index 2> (optional) - ... resource ID This parameter specifies the resource for which the attributes shall be resolved. This resource must be defined within the *resources* section of the template (see also :ref:`hot_spec_resources`). attribute name The attribute name is required as it specifies the attribute to be resolved. If the attribute returns a complex data structure such as a list or a map, then subsequent keys or indexes can be specified which navigate the data structure to return the desired value. Some examples of how to use the get_attr function are shown below: :: resources: my_instance: type: OS::Nova::Server # ... outputs: instance_ip: description: IP address of the deployed compute instance value: { get_attr: [my_instance, first_address] } instance_private_ip: description: Private IP address of the deployed compute instance value: { get_attr: [my_instance, networks, private, 0] } In this example, if the networks attribute contained the following data: :: {""public"": [""2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329"", ""1.2.3.4""], ""private"": [""10.0.0.1""]} then the value of the get_attr function would resolve to ""10.0.0.1"". get_file ------------ The *get_file* function allows string content to be substituted into the template. It is generally used as a file inclusion mechanism for files containing non-heat scripts or configuration files. The syntax of the get_file function is as follows: :: get_file: <content key> The *content key* will be used to look up the files dictionary that is provided in the REST API call. The *heat* client command from python-heatclient is *get_file* aware and will populate the *files* with the actual content of fetched paths and URLs. The *heat* client command supports relative paths and will transform these to absolute URLs which will be used as the *content key* in the files dictionary. The example below demonstrates *get_file* usage with both relative and absolute URLs. :: resources: my_instance: type: OS::Nova::Server properties: # general properties ... user_data: get_file: my_instance_user_data.sh my_other_instance: type: OS::Nova::Server properties: # general properties ... user_data: get_file: http://example.com/my_other_instance_user_data.sh If this template was launched from a local file this would result in a *files* dictionary containing entries with keys *file:///path/to/my_instance_user_data.sh* and *http://example.com/my_other_instance_user_data.sh*. resource_facade --------------- The *resource_facade* function allows a provider template to retrieve data about its resource facade in the parent template. (A provider template is used to provide a custom definition of a resource - the facade - in the form of a Heat template. The resource's properties are passed to the provider template as its parameters, but other resource data can be included using this function.) The syntax of the *resource_facade* function is as follows:: resource_facade: <data type> The *data type* can be `metadata`, `deletion_policy` or `update_policy`.

This commit removes the resource management code used in the scenario
tests and replaces it with addCleanup. The tearDownClass code created
a LIFO queue for deleting resources created during tests which is
exactly what addCleanup is used for. Additionally, the previous
tearDownClass code only worked for objects created, and couldn't
undo actions such as volume attach which changed the resource state.
addCleanup doesn't have that limitation.

To handle async delete actions a list of waits is added which will be iterated
 over as the last step of clearing the addCleanup queue. That way all the
delete calls are made up front and the tests won't succeed unless the deletes
are eventually successful. This is the same basic approach used in the api
tests to limit cleanup execution time except here it is multi-resource, because
of the nature of the scenario tests.

Right after partitioning, we have a sleep(3) to avoid the ""device is
busy"" problem. A less error-prone solution is to check with fuser,
whether there is any process currently using the disk.

- check_device_interval: seconds between consecutive checks for the
device status
- check_device_max_retries: number of retries for checking the device

And ATA devices have a similar command called ""Trim"" command. This blueprint is aim to support setting discard option for instance's disk. If discard option is ""on"", unused/freed blocks can be return back to the storage device. Qemu1.5 has supported setting discard option for the raw disk. In Qemu1.6, qcow2 file supported discad option too. Problem description =================== 1. thin provision volume When we write data to a thin provision volume, storage device will allocate blocks to it and it will become bigger. But without discard option supported, the blocks will not be freed to the storage device even if we deleted the data in the volume. The result is the thin volume can become big, but can't become small. With discard option supported, when user deleted the data in the volume, the blocks will be freed to the storage device. The volume will become to small. It's useful for both ephemeral volume and cinder volume. 2. SSD backed volume Free the unused blocks to the SSD storage is useful to impoving the performance and prolonging the liftime of SSD. Proposed change =============== Support the user to specify the discard metadata for the volume or the image. For example: "" hw_disk_discard=unmap #enable discard hw_disk_discard=ignore #disable discard, by default "" For a volume which have the discard option, nova will produce the xml with a discard property when the volume is attached to an instance. Alternatives ------------ Implement the discard option as a core property of the volume or image. Refer to other implement of the cinder and image, it's better to implement by metadata. And discard option is not like a core property.

This tests showing and updating the 'default' quota class, which is
really all this API is used for. It was removed in Icehouse in part to
not knowing it was used even though python-novaclient and Horizon were
using it. The removal was reverted and this change is to enforce what
the API is used for.

The extension only lives in the Nova v2 API, it was removed in the v3
API in Icehouse.

This change adds new quota client and test classes for the new API.

An external lock fixture is used in all compute API quota tests to
avoid introducing race bugs with the existing tenant-specific
os-quota-sets tests.

Now most attributes of Nova v2/v3 APIs are not checked in Tempest,
and this patch adds some tests which check these attributes to block
the backward incompatibility change in the future.

This patch adds the checks of ""get a server"" API responses.

For larger images, nova is timing out to boot an
instance from the volume. To fix it, block device
mapping logic is updated to make the timeout value
as configurable from nova.conf. By default its
set to 180 seconds as earlier.

DocImpact
/etc/nova/nova.conf is updated with following
variables:
block_device_mapping_timeout - Maximum number of
seconds to wail for volume creation, while
instance is booted from volume.
block_device_mapping_polling_interval - Number
of seconds to poll for volume creation while
instance is booted from volume

Discovered some tests that were coupling the code under test with the

 * two TestCases in test_wsgi were missing @patch_policies

   between tests
 * patch_policies' legacy and default collections get a FakeRing by

 * drive-by cleanup for test_loadapp_proxy() ring serialized path

 * drive-by cleanup for test_internal_client that was doing basically
   the same thing as test_wsgi

In FWaaS, administrator can use port range and protocol inside firewall rules
to define traffic type. But we don't have a flexible way to allow user to specify more
than one type of traffic in the same rule.To support different traffic type, with the
same source, destination address and action, different rules need to be created.
This makes the process of defining firewall rules un-scalable.

two resources are added to the db
one is called service group(class ServiceGroup) and one is called service object(class ServiceObject)
class ServiceGroupDbMixin is mixin lcass to add service group to db plugin base,
service group id is added to class firewall rule and the corresponding dict
reference implementation support is not yet complete and will be fully done in next patch.
the agent queries the service group content from plugin	and expend the firewal rule based on the
content of the service group into the iptable rules.
Administrator can use service object to define a special type of traffic. The service
objects is grouped into service group that can be referenced from other openstack
modules (eg. firewall rule).
Each service object can be defined with a timeout value that can be used to overwrite
default session idle timeout value.

Update the Nova driver's rebuild() to account for changes in the instance image
during rebuild.  Currently, rebuild ignores user requests to rebuild with a
new image, making it impossible to do image-based upgrades.  This adds logic
to the patcher to account for the preserve_ephemeral flag and updates rebuild()

This also adds missing test coverage of the rebuild code.

Without a context, the raw_template was being stored using a different DB
session, with the result that changes did not end up in the database.

Also, don't use the same raw_template DB entry for the backup stack, since
that causes competing modifications to the DB that break rollback.

The compute manager has been calling get_instance_disk_info on
virt driver implementations during block migration, despite
this method not being declared in the virt driver API. It was
implemented in libvirt and stubbed in xenapi, with different
API signatures in both.

Declare & document it as part of the virt driver API, and
split the libvirt impl into two parts to hide the libvirt
specific notion of XML config.

The remove_filters_for_instance() method fails silently if the
instance's chain is gone (i.e. it's been deleted). If this
happens while we're refreshing security group rules, we will
not notice this case and re-add stale rules for an old instance,
breaking our firewall for new instances.

This adds a quick check after we've captured the lock to see if
the associated chain exists, and bails if it doesn't.

The config docs have historically recommended that the number of
glance  workers should be set to the number of CPUs available for
best performance, so we should make this the default.

Commit 75c96a48fc7e5dfb59d8258142b01422f81b0253 did the same thing in
Nova in Icehouse and the plan is to do the same thing for Cinder
and Trove workers.

The config files are updated to match the help string in the code.

There is no upgrade impact since glance-api.conf previously
hard-coded the workers value to 1 so anyone upgrading to this
will still get whatever value was set in glance-api.conf prior
to this change.

DocImpact: glance workers will now be equal to the number of
           CPUs available by default if not explicitly specified
           in glance-api.conf and/or glance-registry.conf.

UpgradeImpact: There is no upgrade impact to glance-api workers
           since glance-api.conf previously hard-coded the workers
           value to 1 so anyone upgrading to tihs will still get
           whatever value was set in glance-api.conf prior to
           this change. There is an upgrade impact to the

           I0cee0d284eef9ce5dcb26720499f2c4d31eaca0f, which is

           glance-registry.conf will now be running multiple
           workers by default when they restart the glance
           registry service.

Bugs such as 1327145 when the rpc code is accidentally reverted
to passing dicts instead of objects are not currently detected by
the unit tests because these are always called with a dict.

This change updates all compute rpcapi unit test cases to pass
an instance object to all cases where the version has been
converted to objects, so that such issues are now detected.

Each project, in turn, has multiple services. To process some request, e.g. to boot a virtual machine, OpenStack uses multiple services from different projects. In case something works too slowly, it's extremely complicated to understand what exactly goes wrong and to locate the bottleneck. To resolve this issue, we introduce a tiny but powerful library, **osprofiler**, that is going to be used by all OpenStack projects and their python clients. To be able to generate 1 trace per request, that goes through all services invoved, and builds a tree of calls (see an `example <http://pavlovic.me/rally/profiler/>`_). Why not cProfile and etc? ------------------------- **The scope of this lib is a quite different:** * We are interested in getting one trace of points from different service, not tracing all python calls inside one process * This library should be easy integrable in OpenStack. It means that: * It shouldn't require too much changes in code bases of projects * We should be able to turn it off fully * We should be able to keep it turned on in lazy mode (trace on request) OSprofiler API version 0.2.0 ---------------------------- There are couple of things that you should know about API before learning it. * **3 ways to add new trace point** .. parsed-literal:: from osprofiler import profiler def some_func(): profiler.start(""point_name"", {""any_info_about_point"": ""in_this_dict""}) # your code profiler.stop({""any_info_about_point"": ""in_this_dict""}) @profiler.Trace(""point_name"", {""any_info_about_point"": ""in_this_dict""}) def some_func2(): pass def some_func3(): with profiler.trace(""point_name"", {""any_info_about_point"": ""in_this_dict""}): # some code here * **How works profiler actually?** * **@profiler.Trace()** and **profiler.trace()** are just syntax sugar, that just call profiler.start() & profiler.stop() methods. * It sends to **collector** 1 message per every call of profiler.start() & profiler.stop(). So every trace points crates 2 records in collector. *(more about collector later)* * Trace points support nesting, so next sample will work properly: .. parsed-literal:: profiler.start(""parent_point"") profiler.start(""child_point"") profiler.stop() profiler.stop() In sample above, we will create 2 points: This is implemented in quite simple manner. We have one stack that contains ids of all trace points. E.g.: .. parsed-literal:: profiler.start(""parent_point"") # trace_stack.push(<new_uuid>) # send to collector -> trace_stack[-2:] profiler.start(""parent_point"") # trace_stack.push(<new_uuid>) # send to collector -> trace_stack[-2:] profiler.stop() # send to collector -> trace_stack[-2:] # trace_stack.pop() profiler.stop() # send to collector -> trace_stack[-2:] # trace_stack.pop() So with this information from collector, we can restore order and nesting of all points. * **What is actually send to to collector?** Trace points are presented in collector as 2 messages (start and stop) .. parsed-literal:: { ""name"": <point_name>-(start|stop) ""base_id"": <uuid>, ""parent_id"": <uuid>, ""trace_id"": <uuid>, ""info"": <dict> } * base_id - is <uuid> that is equal for all trace points that belongs to one trace, it is done to simplify process of retrieving all trace points related to one trace from collector * parent_id - is <uuid> that has parent trace point * trace_id - is <uuid> of current trace point * info - it's dictionary that contains user information passed via calls of profiler start & stop methods. * **Setting up Collector.** Profiler doesn't include any collector for trace points, end user should provide method that will send message to collector. Let's take a look at trivial sample, where collector is just a file: .. parsed-literal:: import json from osprofiler import notifier def send_info_to_file_collector(info, context=None): with open(""traces"", ""a"") as f: f.write(json.dumps()) notifier.set(send_info_to_file_collector) So now on every **profiler.start()** and **profiler.stop()** call we will write info about trace point to the end of **traces** file. * **Initialization of profiler.** If profiler is not initialized, all calls of profiler.start() and profiler.stop() are ignored. Initialization is quite simple. .. parsed-literal:: from osprofiler import profiler profiler.init(""SECRET_HMAC_KEY"", base_id=<uuid>, parent_id=<uuid>) ""SECRET_HMAC_KEY"" - will be discussed later, cause it's related to the integration of OSprofiler & OpenStack. **base_id** and **trace_id** will actually initialize trace_stack in profiler, e.g. stack_trace = [base_id, trace_id]. Integration with OpenStack -------------------------- There are 4 topics related to integration OSprofiler & OpenStack: * **What to use as centralized collector** We decided to use Ceilometer, because: * It's already integrated in OpenStack, so it's quite simple to send notifications to it from every project. * There is a OpenStack API in Ceilometer that allows us to retrieve all messages related to one trace. Take a look at *osprofiler.parsers.ceilometer:get_notifications* * **How to setup profiler notifier, to send messages to this collector** We decided to use olso.messaging Notifier API, because: * oslo.messaging is integrated in all projects * It's the simplest way to send notification to Ceilometer, take a look at: *osprofiler.notifiers.messaging.Messaging:notify* method * We don't need to add any new CONF options in projects * **How to initialize profiler, to have one trace cross all services** To enable cross service profiling we actually need to do send from caller to callee (base_id & trace_id). So callee will be able to init his profiler with these values. In case of OpenStack there are 2 kinds interaction between to services: * REST API It's well know that there are python clients for every projects, that generates proper HTTP request, and parses response to objects. These python clients are used in 2 cases: * User access OpenStack * Service from Project 1 would like to access Service from Project 2 So what we need is to: * Put in python clients headers with trace info (if profiler is inited) * Add OSprofiler WSGI middleware to service, that will init profiler, if there are special trace headers. Actually the algorithm is a bit more complex. Python client are signed trace info, and WSGI middleware checks that it's signed with HMAC that is specified in api-paste.ini. So only user that knows HMAC key in api-paste.ini can init properly profiler and send trace info that will be actually processed. * RPC API RPC calls are used for interaction between services of one project. As we all known for RPC projects are using oslo.messaging. So the best way to enable cross service tracing (inside on project). Is to add trace info to all messages (if profiler is inited). And initialize profiler on callee side. * **What points should be by default tracked** I think that for all projects we should include by default 3 kinds o points: * All HTTP calls * All RPC calls * All DB calls","OpenStack consists of multiple projects. Each project, in turn, has multiple services. To process some request, e.g. to boot a virtual machine, OpenStack uses multiple services from different projects. In case something works too slowly, it's extremely complicated to understand what exactly goes wrong and to locate the bottleneck. To resolve this issue, we introduce a tiny but powerful library, **osprofiler**, that is going to be used by all OpenStack projects and their python clients. This library generates 1 trace per request, that goes through all services invoved, and builds a tree of calls (see an `example <http://pavlovic.me/rally/profiler/>`_). *osprofiler* maintains a trace stack, which is shared between different services calling each other, thus being able to track nested method calls even across different OpenStack projects. By using a thread-safe storage, *osprofiler* takes care of the fact that each request to a certain service gets processed in a separated thread (so that each request results in a separate trace stack being maintained by this library). *osproifiler* calls a special driver (*notify()*) on start & stop of every event. These notifications contain some special info that allows the user to track the stack of calls + meta info. In the case of OpenStack, notifications are expected to be sent to *Ceilometer* using the *oslo.messaging notifier API*. This enables to use *Ceilometer* as a centralized collecter, as well as to have an OpenStack API to retrieve all notifications related to one trace. To be more specific, *osprofiler* supports `retrieving all notifications in a single request <https://gist.github.com/boris-42/9a8f905d3c5bc7496984>`_ and, optionally, their analysis by producing a `tree of calls <https://gist.github.com/boris-42/c3c3ee1c2c7db40de236>`_. To restrict its usage by non-allowed persons, *osprofiler* supports `HMAC authentication <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code>`_. With this authentication mechanism enabled (and the same HMAC key set in the *osprofiler* section of the *api-paste.ini* file across all services involved), only users that know the HMAC key are able to use the profiling library and create traces. Usage ----- This simple example below demonstates how to use *osprofiler*, as well as what are the contents of the trace stack maintained by this library at each step: .. parsed-literal:: from osprofiler import profile profiler.init(base_id=1, parent_id=1) *# Initializes a thread-safe stack for storing traces.* *# In case there is no init() call, all future start()/stop()* *# calls will be ignored by osprofiler.* *# stack = [1, 1]* profiler.start(name=""code block 1"") *# stack = [1, 1, uuid1], sends notification with (base_id=1, parent_id=1, trace_id=uuid1)* profiler.start(name=""code block 2"") *# stack = [1, 1, uuid1, uuid2], sends notification with (base_id=1, parent_id=uuid1, trace_id=uuid2)* profiler.stop() *# stack = [1, 1, uuid1], sends notification with (base_id=1, parent_id=uuid1, trace_id=uuid2)* profiler.start(name=""code block 3"") *# stack = [1, 1, uuid1, uuid3], sends notification with (base_id=1, parent_id=uuid1, trace_id=uuid3)* profiler.stop() *# stack = [1, 1, rand1], sends notification with (base_id=1, parent_id=uuid1, trace_id=uuid3)* profiler.stop() *# stack = [1, 1], sends notification with (base_id=1, parent_id=1, trace_id=1)* After running this example, there will be 6 notifications for 3 events, and *osprofiler* will be able to restore the tree of calls, if needed. The alternative syntax uses the `Trace object <https://github.com/stackforge/osprofiler/blob/master/osprofiler/profiler.py#L64>`_ from the profiler module, which should be used in a *with*-statement: .. parsed-literal:: from osprofiler import profiler ... with profiler.Trace(name=""code block name"", info={...}): *# Code to be profiled* The following example shows a real custom *notification function* from the *oslo.messaging library*: *oslo.messaging.profiler* .. parsed-literal:: **import osprofiler.notifier** **from oslo.messaging.notify import notifier** def set_notifier(context, transport, project, service, host): """"""Sets OSprofiler's notifer based on oslo.messaging notifier API. OSProfiler will call this method on every call of profiler.start() and profiler.stop(). These messages will be collected by Ceilometer, which which allows end users to retrieve traces via Ceilometer API. :context: the request context :transport: oslo.messaging transport :project: project name (e.g. nova, cinder, glance...) :service: service name, that sends notification (nova-conductor) :host: service's host name """""" *# Notifier based on oslo.messaging notifier API* **_notifier = notifier.Notifier(transport, publisher_id=host, driver=""messaging"", topic=""profiler"")** **def notifier_func(payload):** """"""This method will be called on profiler.start() and profiler.stop(). :payload: Contains information about trace element.

""parent_id"" - uuid of parent element in trace ""trace_id"" - uuid of current element in trace Using parent_id and trace_id it's quite simple to build tree of trace elements, which simplify analyze of trace.

Library contents ---------------- Along with the basic profiling algorithm implementation, the *osprofiler* library includes a range of **profiling applications**, available out-of-box. First, there is **SQLAlchemy profiling**. It's well known that OpenStack haevily uses *SQLAlchemy*. SQLAlchemy is a cool stuff that allows to add handlers for different events before and after SQL execution. With *osprofiler*, we can run *profiler.start()* before execution with info that contains an SQL request and call *profiler.stop()* after execution. This allows to collect the information about all DB calls across all services. To enable this DB profiling, just *osprofiler* to an **engine** instance (this will allow it to add event listeners to points before and after SQL execution): .. parsed-literal:: from osprofiler import sqlalchemy sqlalchemy.add_tracing(*<sqlalchemy_module>*, *<engine_instance>*, *<name>*) Second, there is **Web profiling**. The main interaction mechanism between different OpenStack projects is issuing requests to each other. Thus, to be able to be easliy integrated with OpenStack projects, *osprofiler* supports processing such requests via a special **WSGI Middleware** for tracing Web applications: .. parsed-literal:: import webob.dec from osprofiler import profiler ... class WsgiMiddleware(object): """"""WSGI Middleware that enables tracing for an application."""""" ... @webob.dec.wsgify def __call__(self, request): if not self.enabled: return request.get_response(self.application) *# Trace info is passed through headers. In case the trace info header* *# is not present, no profiling will be done.* **trace_info_enc = request.headers.get(""X-Trace-Info"")** *# HMAC key is passed through headers as well.* **trace_hmac = request.headers.get(""X-Trace-HMAC"")** ... if trace_info_enc: trace_raw = utils.binary_decode(trace_info_enc) *# Validating the HMAC key.* try: **validate_hmac(trace_raw, trace_hmac, self.hmac_key)** except IOError: pass else: trace_info = json.loads(trace_raw) *# Initializing the profiler with the info retrieved from headers.* **profiler.init(trace_info.get(""base_id""), trace_info.get(""parent_id""), self.hmac_key)** *# The trace info that will be sent to the notifier.* info = { ""request"": { ""host_url"": request.host_url, ""path"": request.path, ""query"": request.query_string, ""method"": request.method, ""scheme"": request.scheme } } *# Profiling the request.* **with profiler.Trace(self.name, info=info): return request.get_response(self.application)** *# If there is no trace info header, just process the request without profiling.* return request.get_response(self.application) Integration example ------------------- **OSProfiler** can be easily integrated with any of the core OpenStack projects, e.g. `Nova <https://github.com/boris-42/nova/commit/9ebe86bf5b4cc7150251396cfb302dd05e89085d>`_. Basically, it requires setting up the corresponding notifier function for the *WSGI service*, and then adding the *osprofiler WSGI middleware* in a special *api-paste.ini* file. The example below shows how it looks for Nova: *nova.service* .. parsed-literal:: ... from oslo.messaging import profiler class Service(service.Service): """"""Service object for binaries running on hosts."""""" def __init__(self, host, binary, topic, manager, ...): ... *# Set the notifier function with the admin request context* *# and corresponding project & service parameters* **profiler.set_notifier(context.get_admin_context().to_dict(), rpc.TRANSPORT, ""nova"", binary, host)** ... class WSGIService(object): """"""Provides ability to launch API from a 'paste' configuration."""""" def __init__(self, name, loader=None, use_ssl=False, max_url_len=None): ... *# Set the notifier function with the admin request context* *# and corresponding project & service parameters* **profiler.set_notifier(context.get_admin_context().to_dict(), rpc.TRANSPORT, ""nova"", name, self.host)** ... *etc/nova/api-paste.ini* .. parsed-literal:: ... [composite:openstack_compute_api_v2] use = call:nova.api.auth:pipeline_factory noauth = compute_req_id faultwrap sizelimit **osprofiler** noauth ... keystone = compute_req_id faultwrap sizelimit **osprofiler** authtoken ... keystone_nolimit = compute_req_id faultwrap sizelimit **osprofiler** authtoken ... ...

The messagebus service is renamed dbus in Fedora. As such the
instructions have been updated to provide both the RHEL/CentOS
and Fedora variants.

Examples of the service/chkconfig commands were not switched to
systemctl in this change as service/chkconfig remains used
consistently across the guide at this time and works on both
RHEL/CentOS-based and Fedora distributions.

Exposing the raw Token ID in the debug log is almost
as bad as exposing the username/password as a valid
token conveys authorization as long as the token is
valid.

This change obscures the token from the debug logging
and if the token contains a unique tracking id in the
token_data, it will add that into the log-line.

The unique token tracking id will allow for correlating
a specific token to any and all requests made with that
token.

Changes:
 - use default.heat.template for each datastore;
 - removed all {datastore}/heat.templates;

Behaviour:
 - deployer still can use custom templates for each of datastores;

The metadata_update interface does pretty much the exact same thing
as handle_signal, with the disadvantage that it's not exposed via
the native ReST API, so convert WaitConditionHandle to use
handle_signal.

This has the following advantages:
- Provides a step towards native waitcondition resources
- Enables signalling existing waitcondition resources via
  heat resource-signal (e.g the native API)
- Moves towards a standardized model where handle_signal is the
  only supported plugin interface for asynchronous signalling of
  resources.

To avoid breaking any CD folks who may not update heat-engine and
heat-api-cfn at the same time, the existing resource interface is
maintained with a deprecation warning (how long to maintain this
is TBC).

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================= Tempest Post-run Cleanup ============================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tempest/+spec/post-run-cleanup Problem description =================== The existing script, /tempest/stress/cleanup.py can be used to do some basic cleanup after a Tempest run, but a more robust tool is needed to completely reset the environment to the pre-run state, which might include some database surgery should a test failure leave the system in a strange state. The idea is that the user should be able to get the system back into a state where tempest can be re-run with the expectation that the same test results will be returned. Currently there can be a good deal of manual work needed, depending on what tests fail, to return to this pre-run state. This blueprint is designed to alleviate this issue. Proposed changes =============== - Keep /tempest/stress/cleanup.py as a starting point and extend it. It should also probably be moved to from /tempest/stess to /tools perhaps? - Currently cleanup.py deletes objects across all tenants. Add argument, --preserve-conf, that will preserve the tenants and users defined in tempest.conf. This will allow tempest to be run again without having to re-run /tools/config_tempest.py - cleanup.py currently deletes servers (instances), keypairs, security groups, floating ips, users, tenants, snapshots and volumes. It should also delete any stacks, availability zones and any other objects created by Tempest, full list TBD. - As mentioned in the overview section above some test failures leave the system in a strange state. For example, an instance cannot be deleted because it is in Error state. Even after using CLI to reset the instance to Active state, future delete calls just result in Error state once again. In such a case it might be necessary to delete the instance's database records directly to remove the instance. A useful addition to the cleanup process would be a way to easily add SQL statements that could be called from within cleanup.py when the --db-cleanup flag is set, outline of design below: - Create new directory /tools/db-cleanup - db-cleanup contains python files that are basically just wrappers around some sql statements. - Example: An instance is in ERROR state and cannot be deleted in Horizon or through CLI, force deletion in database. - Create /tools/db-cleanup/instances.py - instance.py executes queries in specific order to avoid constraint violations: - delete from security_group_instance_association... - delete from instance_info_caches... - delete from block_device_mapping... - delete from instance_actions_events.. - delete from instance_actions... - delete from instance_faults... - delete from instance_system_metadata... - delete from virtual_interfaces... - delete from instances where... - When --db-cleanup argument is passed to cleanup.py the queries in /tools/db-cleanup/instances.py are executed. Scenario 1: run cleanup.py -------------------------------------- This is the current behavior, which deletes all objects in the system, with the exception of the missing ones, stacks and availability zones for example. Scenario 2: run cleanup.py --preserve-conf ---------------------------------------------------------- Same as Scenario 1 except that objects defined in tempest.conf, that are used in a Tempest run are preserved. For example (exceptions are variables defined in tempest.conf): delete all users except: username, alt_username, admin_username delete all tenants except: tenant_name, alt_tenant_name, admin_tenant_name delete all images except: image_ref, image_ref_alt ... Scenario 3: run cleanup.py --db-cleanup ------------------------------------------- Same as Scenario 1 or 2 and in addition all queries defined in /tools/db-cleanup/*.py are executed to remove any cruft that cannot be deleted via API calls. Note: Scenario 3 should recognize the --preserve-conf flag and only delete the appropriate records as well. Additional Implications ----------------------- Going around an API and physically deleting records directly in the database is typically a really bad idea. Alternatives ------------ Question: are there alternatives to directly deleting database records when objects seem to get in a ""stuck"", undeletable, state? Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: David Paterson <davpat2112@yahoo.com> Can optionally can list additional ids if they intend on doing substantial implementation work on this blueprint. Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: - Juno release cycle Work Items ---------- - refactor location of cleanup.py - register new runtime arguments in cleanup.py - enable filtering deletions based on --preserve-conf argument and values defined in tempest.conf - create base class in /tools/db-cleanup/ for executing sql statements - Implement --db-cleanup flag so that all queries in the subclasses defined in /tools/db-cleanup execute.

system based database which is in /var/lib/cobbler/config
directory, we have to migrate this directory from one
container to another.

We have the next data migartion flow for cobbler
