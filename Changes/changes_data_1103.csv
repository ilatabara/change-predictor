The change makes OCF script ignore small number of timeouts of rabbitmqctl
for 'heavy' operations: list_channels, get_alarms and list_queues.
Number of tolerated timeouts in a row is configured through a new variable
'max_rabbitmqctl_timeouts'. By default it is set to 1, i.e. rabbitmqctl
timeouts are not tolerated at all.

Bug #1487517 is fixed by extracting declaration of local variables
'rc_alarms' and 'rc_queues' from assignment operations.


Text for Operations Guide:

If on node where RabbitMQ is deployed
other processes consume significant part of CPU, RabbitMQ starts
responding slow to queries by 'rabbitmqctl' utility. The utility is
used by RabbitMQ's OCF script to monitor state of the RabbitMQ.
When utility fails to return in pre-defined timeout, OCF script
considers RabbitMQ to be down and restarts it, which might lead to
a limited (several minutes) OpenStack downtime. Such restarts
are undesirable as they cause downtime without benefit. To
mitigate the issue, the OCF script might be told to tolerate
certain amount of rabbitmqctl timeouts in a row using the following
command:
  crm_resource --resource p_rabbitmq-server --set-parameter \
      max_rabbitmqctl_timeouts --parameter-value N

Here N should be replaced with the number of timeouts. For instance,
if it is set to 3, the OCF script will tolerate two rabbitmqctl
timeouts in a row, but fail if the third one occurs.

By default the parameter is set to 1, i.e. rabbitmqctl timeout is not
tolerated at all. The downside of increasing the parameter is that
if a real issue occurs which causes rabbitmqctl timeout, OCF script
will detect that only after N monitor runs and so the restart, which
might fix the issue, will be delayed.

To understand that RabbitMQ's restart was caused by rabbitmqctl timeout
you should examine lrmd.log of the corresponding controller on Fuel
master node in /var/log/docker-logs/remote/ directory. Here lines like

When rbd is used for ephemeral disks and image storage, we can avoid
local disk by doing the snapshot with ceph, and sending the location
of it to glance.

At this point glance is effectively the owner of the snapshot, and
nova cannot delete the original disk, so a corresponding change to
glance is needed to handle this cleanup later, when the snapshot is
deleted.

To accomplish this, create an rbd clone and store the clone's location
in glance, and when nova deletes an rbd disk with snapshots, rename
the disk to include a marker that glance looks for to know they can be
deleted when glance deletes the snapshots.

This requires changing the typical permissions for the glance ceph
user to allow writing to the pool where vm images are stored.

DocImpact: glance will need write access to rbd to delete snapshots

It looks like this introduced race bug 1491949 in the
gate-tempest-dsvm-large-ops job causing rpc timeouts when
deallocating network information for an instance,
specifically around the dnsmasq callback to release the
fixed IP that the instance was using which triggers the

Let's say you have some code like this:

class TestStuff(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_a_thing(self):
        # [setup code goes here]
        with mock.patch(""swift.obj.auditor.os.wait"", fake_os_wait), \

             mock.patch.object(my_auditor, '_sleep', lambda *a: None):
            my_auditor.run_once()

pep8 will complain about this with a pair of messages like this: ""E127
continuation line over-indented for visual indent"", plus some line
numbers. It's complaining about the indentations of the second and
third lines in the 'with' clause.

Okay, so it's over-indented. Let's indent it less.

        with mock.patch(""swift.obj.auditor.os.wait"", fake_os_wait), \
           mock.patch.object(my_auditor, 'fork_child', fake_fork_child), \
           mock.patch.object(my_auditor, '_sleep', lambda *a: None):
            my_auditor.run_once()

Now it's uglier, and pep8 still says it's over-indented. Keep going:

        with mock.patch(""swift.obj.auditor.os.wait"", fake_os_wait), \
          mock.patch.object(my_auditor, 'fork_child', fake_fork_child), \
          mock.patch.object(my_auditor, '_sleep', lambda *a: None):
            my_auditor.run_once()

Nope.

        with mock.patch(""swift.obj.auditor.os.wait"", fake_os_wait), \
         mock.patch.object(my_auditor, 'fork_child', fake_fork_child), \
         mock.patch.object(my_auditor, '_sleep', lambda *a: None):

Still no.

            my_auditor.run_once()

Still no. Different error this time, though.

Okay, let's try adding some spaces to see if that'll make it less...
over-indented. *sigh*

        with mock.patch(""swift.obj.auditor.os.wait"", fake_os_wait), \

               mock.patch.object(my_auditor, 'fork_child', fake_fork_child), \
               mock.patch.object(my_auditor, '_sleep', lambda *a: None):

                mock.patch.object(my_auditor, 'fork_child', fake_fork_child), \

                 mock.patch.object(my_auditor, '_sleep', lambda *a: None):
            my_auditor.run_once()

BAHAHA no.

Got it? When pep8 says that a continuation line is over-indented, you
need to add exactly three spaces. Three shall be the number thou shalt
count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou
not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to
three. Five is right out.

This commit blacklists E127 so nobody else has to waste time on this
garbage.

Nova only set host and node when it wants to evacuate
an instance. Unlink other operations such as unshelve or
create, there is no claim means sometimes the host might
have enough resource will still do the evacuate operations.
This patch adds check for resources when doing evacuate.

This is really grasping at straws but commit ef9dedb2f which introduced
this code in the guest module changed passing flags from a positional
argument to a kwarg and we're wondering if that is somehow messing up
how PyArg_ParseTuple is handling this - like maybe the underlying
libvirt just never gets called.

Also adds return code checking on attachDeviceFlags since if it's not
failing and raising libvirtError, we want to make sure it's at least
returning 0, and not something unexpected like None.

Log the flags while we're at it.

Existing rsync stop/start handlers were relying on the pattern
parameter to the Ansible service module which relies on the results
of ps to determine if the service is running. This is unnecessary
because the rsync service script is well-behaved and responds
appropriately to start stop and restart commands. Removal of the
pattern param ensures that the response from the service command is
used instead.

Root cause of the bug is that when Keystone was changed to share
fernet secrets via rsync over ssh tunnel, an rsync process was
introduced in AIOs, Swift stand-alones, and other deployment
configurations that contain Keystone containers on the storage hosts.

The resulting rsync processes within Keystone containers pollute the
results of ps commands on the host, fooling Ansible into thinking
that an rsync service is running on the standard port when it is not.

Secondly, the handler responsible for stopping rsync was not causing
the notice for ""Ensure rsync service running"" to trigger cleanly in
my testing, so the tasks were changed to trigger both notices in an
ordered list.

When read_affinity is used and sorting_method is not used warnings
are generated in the swift proxy log indicating that the
read_affinity is not being respected. When read_affinity is specified
this change sets the sorting_method to affinity automatically, and
otherwise uses a configured value which defaults to shuffle.

Note that write_affinity does not respect sorting_method and follows
a different code path and does not issue warnings in logs when used

When nova is used without shared_storage and glance doesn't have the
images required by the instance anymore, the live block migration code
can't prepare the destination host properly.

This patch catches the case when images are not found in glance, and
copies the missing images from the source host, like the
migrate_disk_and_power_off code already does.

The KVM disk deep copy method is not used because it won't work for AMI
image that depends of AKI/ARI image. kernel and initrd are not considered
by the kvm disk migration because they are readonly file (by the kvm pov)
used only to boot the VM.

Put simply, they should only create elements like columns, indices, and tables. * Subtractive schema migrations - To remove an element like a column or table during the N release cycle: #. The element must be deprecated and retained for backward compatibility. (This allows for graceful upgrade from N to N+1.) #. Data migration, by the objects layer, must completely migrate data from the old version of the schema to the new version. #. The column can then be removed with a migration at the start of N+2. * Data migrations - As mentioned above, data migrations will be done in an online fashion by custom code in the object layer that handles moving data between the old and new portions of the schema.

The CommandRunner used to run commands using su command and passing the
actual command to be run as argument to it.

su USER -c <cmd>

This is susceptible to command line injection as noted in the bug.

The fix required to do two things:

1. Pass the command to be run as list instead of a string. This is to
ensure that the actual arguments are passed as arguments to the program
ought to be executed. And by doing so, avoids running any commands
passed in the argument. On the contrary, if the command were passed as a
string to the shell, the arguments could be formed in a way to execute
malicious commands.

2. The CommandRunner runs the command directly and uses setuid to lower
the privileges if needed. If the 'runas' user is other than root, then
its UID is obtained and setuid is invoked to set the real user-id and
effective user-id to the given user.

The volume connectors are currently saving some system metadata.  This
is specifically the NPIV connector which uses the system metadata to
store the WWPNs of the VM.

While the spawn and other lifecycle operations call instance.save, the
volume attach and detach do not.  This change provides a save invocation
on the attach.  Detach is not included as it is not critical to the bug
and may have broader impacts for live migration.

It is not put in the npiv volume connector directly as that would
guarantee a save call, when it in fact may not be required.

Since Blazar was in Winter, lots of tech debt was added.

This big change is actually trying to provide a +1 from Jenkins voting jobs.
ie.

 - fix calls to oslo_config
 - correct unittests failing due to removed assert_called()
 - remove pep8 check for verifying blazar.conf (can be readded later)
 - fix oslo_messaging imports

Not sure it's fully functional, Tempest needs to be fixed too but I
hope the gate will allow that change to pass.

When an exception rises on RBD store while adding/creating an image, and
the image has already been created, this new image is not properly
deleted as it should be.

Fault lies in incorrect call to Store._delete_image method, as it is
called with the wrong arguments.

Currently if the same path is used in two filesystem_store_datadirs a
BadStoreConfiguration exception is raised in the filesystem driver.

This is the desired behavior if the same path appears with different
priorities, as we don't know which one is correct, but if it appears
with the same priority (it is an exact duplicate) a warning in the log
should be enough.

Functional tests job are broken. This change proposes add post
test hook in ironicclient, which will be executed inside
post_test_hook function in devstack gate.

The benefit from this approach is it will immediately pick up
proposed fixes on ironicclient side and runs job. It allows us
to see the change breaks tests or not w/o merging related
changes.

post_test_hook runs functional tests and generate testr results
(original implementation was stolen from novaclient).

The location of subunit2html changed on the images in the gate
so update the path used in the post_test_hook.

Created the clustering implementation for Percona XtraDB Cluster
Server. Used the existing framework for adding a new cluster strategy
for percona. Created guestagent, api, and taskmanager calls to setup
the cluster.

Ran into a weird issue where creating the admin user was not being
saved even though there was no error logged. I believe this was
happening because mysql was technically up from the mysqladmin ping
cmd but was not processing the grant call yet. I've heard that to be
sure you should run a 'select 1;' call to verify that mysql is really
ready after starting it. I added a method to verify this.

PXC needs a few more ports opened up for the group comm, state
transfer, and incremental state transfer. Added the percona
cluster.cnf template file for the setting needed in PXC. When a
joining instance first joins the cluster it syncs all the data using
xtrabackup, this will cause the joining instance to lose its admin
user os_admin. So we reset the admin to a new password across the
board.

Make Percona Xtradb Cluster a different datastore because there are
muliple version of PXC. This has been tested with pxc 5.5 from the
ubuntu repository.

Adding coverage xml output in tox.ini

DocImpact
Adding a new datastore percona-xtradb-cluster(pxc) that should not
have any special cases for create and delete cluster.

Implements a replication strategy for Redis.  The following
commands have been added to the Redis datastore manager:

create (with --replica_of and --replica_count arguments)
detach-replica
eject-replica-source
promote-to-replica-source

Unit tests were added, along with integration tests.

To run:
./redstack install
./redstack kick-start redis
(vi /etc/trove/test.conf and change volume_support to false)
./redstack int-tests --group=replication (or --group=redis_supported)

DocImpact: Documentation should reflect the newly supported
features for Redis (see above).

It used to be that a GET of a tempurl referencing a large object would
let you download that large object regardless of where its segments
lived. However, this led to some violated user expectations around
container tempurls.

(Note on shorthand: all tempurls reference objects. However, ""account
tempurl"" and ""container tempurl"" are shorthand meaning tempurls
generated using a key on the account or container, respectively.)

Let's say an application is given tempurl keys to a particular
container, and it does all its work therein using those keys. The user
expects that, if the application is compromised, then the attacker
only gains access to the ""compromised-container"". However, with the old
behavior, the attacker could read data from *any* container like so:

1) Choose a ""victim-container"" to download

2) Create PUT and GET tempurl for any object name within the
   ""compromised-container"". The object doesn't need to exist;
   we'll create it.

3) Using the PUT tempurl, upload a DLO manifest with
   ""X-Object-Manifest: /victim-container/""

4) Using the GET tempurl, download the object created in step 3. The
   result will be the concatenation of all objects in the
   ""victim-container"".

Step 3 need not be for all objects in the ""victim-container""; for
example, a value ""X-Object-Manifest: /victim-container/abc"" would only
be the concatenation of all objects whose names begin with ""abc"". By
probing for object names in this way, individual objects may be found
and extracted.

A similar bug would exist for manifests referencing other accounts
except that neither the X-Object-Manifest (DLO) nor the JSON manifest
document (SLO) have a way of specifying a different account.

This change makes it so that a container tempurl only grants access to
objects within its container, *including* large-object segments. This
breaks backward compatibility for container tempurls that may have
pointed to cross container *LO's, but (a) there are security
implications, and (b) container tempurls are a relatively new feature.

This works by having the tempurl middleware install an authorization
callback ('swift.authorize' in the WSGI environment) that limits the
scope of any requests to the account or container from which the key
came.

This requires swift.authorize to persist for both the manifest request
and all segment requests; this is done by having the proxy server
restore it to the WSGI environment prior to returning from __call__.

All clients should support keystone v3 in kilo. This patch adds
support for keystone sessions, keystone endpoint discovery and support
for the CLI to provide keystone v3 options.

Bumps python-keystoneclient to >=0.11.1 to bring in session support.

This patch was previously dependent on a separate one to add session
support but that work has been squashed into this and its review
(https://review.openstack.org/#/c/131309) will be abandoned.

NOTE: This patch has already been committed and reverted twice,
because of it broke integration tests for other projects.

This is a better representation of how actual resources work.

1. implement check_*_complete
2. measure the time, not just do one sleep
3. add client_name and entity_name so we can actually talk to a service

4. add some example usage in test_create_update.py

Previously NetworksTestJSON was the name of 3 different test classes
in different modules. This was causing issues debugging failures in
one of them because certain class level events are only logged with
the class name to identify where the log message is coming from.
This commit addresses the issue by assigning 3 different names to
each of the test classes.

Cinder currently doesn't check the existing resource
when user lowers the quota sets. It should have an optional
action that doesn't allow to update the quota of resources
lower than current usage.

This patch adds code to validate the update value of quota and
ensure the value can't be lower than existing resource.

APIImpact
Add an optional boolean argument 'skip_validation' with default value True.
{
  ""quota_set"": {xxxx},
  ""skip_validation"": 'True'/'False'
}
If skip_validation=False and the update value is lower than existing resource,
API will return 400 Bad Request.

A specification for this change was submitted and reviewed in
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/211330/

This patchset adds the hooks and configurations options required.
No operation has been reimplemented, MariaDB 5.5 behaves exactly
as MySQL 5.5. Because of this, this patchset depends on the MySQL
Manager Refactor, which makes it possible to the MariaDB driver to
inherit the implementation of the MySQL driver.

Implements blueprint mariadb-datastore-support

Performs backup using the Redis client to persist data to the file
system, then streams the result to swift.

Performs restore by replacing the data file with the Swift backup
and starting the server again in the correct manner.

Note: Running the int-tests require that volume_support is set
to false in the test.conf file.

To run:
./redstack install
./redstack kick-start redis
(vi /etc/trove/test.conf and change volume_support to false)
./redstack int-tests --group=backup (or --group=redis_supported)

This commit fixes the regex generation from the blacklist_file option.
Previously it was only generating an exclude regex (unless a regex was
also provided) this however wasn't working with testr. This was due
to how testr uses the regex certain regexes which just had the

adding a real regex match fixes this issue. So this commit adds logic

Adds the mgmt APIs for

1. Add a new datastore-version.
2. Reset the attributes of an existing datastore-version.
3. List datastore-versions.
4. Get details of a datastore-version.
5. Delete existing datastore-version.

In order to simplify the process of registering an image for a new
datastore/datastore-version the datastore would be managed behind the
scenes. This means that when creating a datastore-version, a datastore
will be automatically created, if it does not already exist.

If using nova-network, ""create a security group"" API call fails

Neutron api creates/uses a port which the port vif_type is
'binding_failed' without any verification, this leads to libvirt
driver failing to create instance, and cause vif driver to raise
a wrong exception message.

This patch ensures that operations like add_router_interface
are correctly dispatched to the plugin.
It does so by introducing fairly ugly hacks in the
resource_identifier, and attribute_population pecan hooks.

This is however the best possible solution wiht the current
infrastructure which basically relies on hooks for request
dispatching.

session is deprecated, but there was no warning generated.

Also, updated the Discover() parameter docstrings with the
standard deprecation info (e.g., in what release it's

The paste pipeline that's ""above"" the /v2/ and /v2.1/ urls is the
oscomputeversions dispatcher, which should provide 300 redirects to
versions in question. Previously the code that was trying to discover
information about the current version did so via a GET of something
that looked like /v2. On an upstream compatible OpenStack this
actually triggers a 300 and redirect to /v2/ for the real answer.

On deployed public clouds, oscomputeversions is sometimes not deployed
at all, or front end blocking by the load balancer does
weirdness. Sometimes with a 401, sometimes a hang.

This fixes the way that first request is made that should avoid the
300 redirect entirely. The code probably should have done this
originally, but it was tested with upstream configuration that worked
fine in this case.

This fix is tested against HP Cloud (the only pub cloud I have creds
with). Before this fix ""nova list"" hangs trying to get the supported
versions, after the fix it works as expected.

I have made some changes to add additional scope awareness to the
StatementBuffer class. Additional functions have been added to allow
you to retrieve the lines of the parent of a given line, or all
children of a given line. Used in combination, it is possible to
retrieve all siblings of a given line.

StatementBuffer also now holds an archive of the AST of every statement
in it's unaltered state, which can be accessed using the new get_node
function, for example calling get_node(get_parent(line_no)) will
return the parent node of the given line, which includes the AST
of that node and all child nodes. Note, all the new functions take
a line number as a parameter, and return line numbers, or an AST
node for get_node().

existing code will create queues from the cartesian product of the
set of pipelines and the set of agents. these queues are identified
by pipe_type-pipe_name-agent_id. the problem arises where if an agent
dies, any messages left on it's queue will be lost as agent_id's tend
to be unique.

this patch changes the logic so rather than using the number of agents
as the set we build our cartesian product from, we use a set of numbers
of a configurable size. by default, it will be a set of 10 so that queues
are created from the product set of the set of pipelines and the set
{0, 1, 2, 3, ... 9}. similarly, the pipelines queues will be identified
by pipe_type-pipe_name-x, where x is value from numerical set. this
way, if an agent dies, the queues are still known and can be
redistributed and processed among the active agents.

Since the plan is to attach first Mitaka scripts to Liberty branches
with down_revision, and since labels are inherited from all other
revisions in the chain, using release names in branch labels would mean
that the following commands would be valid:

neutron-db-manage upgrade liberty_expand@<some_revision_from_mitaka>
neutron-db-manage upgrade mitaka_expand@<some_revision_from_liberty>

which may be confusing to users.

So let's drop release names from branch labels and use expand@head and
contract@head to access latest migrations.

This bug is triggered when haproxy is deployed on multiple hosts
and external_lb_vip is different than the internal one.
As all host receive the same configuration, and are expected
to restart the haproxy service more than once
(once during role and once post_tasks), the playbook will fail,
because the restart of the service fails. The restart of the
service fails on some hosts because haproxy tries to
start/bind to an ip the host doesn't have (avoiding ip conflicts)

This allows haproxy to bind on non_local addresses by
addng a sysctl change in the playbook: net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1
The sysctl is changed for the containers/systems
when external_lb_vip is different than internal address and
the number of haproxy hosts is more than one thanks to a group_var.

Side-effect: other services are able to bind on non-local addresses
if the sysctl is changed.

This could be overriden by setting the variable haproxy_bind_on_non_local
in your user_* variables. If set to false, then the ip_non_local_bind
sysctl won't be changed.

Closes-Bug: #1487409

The os-ansible-deployment project will then only need to implement deviations from the standard OpenStack default settings. Examples of these settings would be minimum settings to make the service work and best practise settings. * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+spec/tunable-openstack-configuration This implementation is intended to: * reduce the cruft of variables the project needs to carry just to enable customisations requested from deployers; * reduce the amount of configuration file settings the project needs to work through for every major upgrade of the underlying OpenStack environment; * increase the turnaround time for deployers to implement additional configuration items in OpenStack configuration files. Problem description =================== The os-ansible-deployment project currently carries a lot of variables in roles which are simply there to enable the ability to override OpenStack default settings, or os-ansible-deployment tuned defaults. This is unnecessary cruft which has to be reviewed for deprecated options whenever the project starts working with an updated version of OpenStack. It also introduces an unnecessary propose/develop/test/release cycle for simple changes to configuration files which could easily be done by a deployer if they're enabled to do so. Proposed change =============== In each role we implement a hash, something like: .. code: yaml keystone_conf_settings: # this should be named according to the file it will be used in DEFAULT: # this should be named according to the section verbose: ""{{ verbose|default('False') }}"" # this is simply a key: value pair that belongs in the section debug: ""{{ debug|default('False') }}"" admin_token: ""{{ keystone_auth_admin_token }}"" public_port: ""{{ keystone_service_port }}"" admin_endpoint: ""{{ keystone_service_adminuri }}"" fatal_deprecations: ""{{ keystone_fatal_deprecations|default('False') }}"" log_file: ""keystone.log"" log_dir: ""/var/log/keystone"" rabbit_hosts: ""{{ rabbitmq_servers }}"" rabbit_userid: ""{{ rabbitmq_userid }}"" rabbit_password: ""{{ rabbitmq_password }}"" memcache: servers: ""127.0.0.1"" max_compare_and_set_retry: ""16"" auth: methods: ""password,token"" database: connection: ""mysql://{{ keystone_galera_user }}:{{ keystone_container_mysql_password }}@{{ galera_address }}/{{ keystone_galera_database }}?charset=utf8"" idle_timeout: ""200"" min_pool_size: ""5"" max_pool_size: ""10"" pool_timeout: ""200"" assignment: driver: ""keystone.assignment.backends.sql.Assignment"" token: expiration: ""43200"" cache_time: ""5400"" provider: ""keystone.token.providers.uuid.Provider"" driver: ""keystone.token.persistence.backends.memcache.Token"" A deployer can then implement something like the following in their user_config file: .. code: yaml keystone_conf_tunables: DEFAULT: public_endpoint: ""{{ keystone_service_publicuri }}"" # this is a new setting in the default section cache: # this is a whole new section backend: ""dogpile.cache.memcached"" backend_argument: ""url:127.0.0.1:11211"" config_prefix: ""cache.keystone"" distributed_lock: ""true"" expiration_time: ""5400"" enabled: ""true"" Defaults are set in the role and a deployer may use the user_config to override specific defaults values or to implement additional key:value pairs in each section, and even additional sections. The template for the related file will then look something like this: .. code: # {{ ansible_managed }} {% for key, value in item.var.items() %} [{{ key }}] {% for _key, _value in value.items() %} {% if _value is string %} {{ _key }}={{ _value }} {% elif _value is number %} {{ _key }}={{ _value }} {% elif _value is iterable %} {{ _key }}={{ _value|join("", "") }} {% else %} # Value type skipped as it was indeterminable # {{ _value }} {% endif %} {% endfor %} {% endfor %} In order to allow a deployer to override specific values (or add new values) and not have to replicate all defaults, we need to implement a jinja2 extension in the ansible configuration. More details are available in a proof of concept configuration and results at https://gist.github.com/odyssey4me/bb1ae8d6f8b6c00a730a Alternatives ------------ Continue to use the current paradigm of adding an ansible variable per configuration configurable file entry. Playbook impact --------------- The existing playbooks would need to be edited to make use of the adjusted ansible variable names, to handle the merge of the defaults and tunables. Upgrade impact -------------- An additional playbook which takes care of the conversion of variables from the old style to the new one will need to be implemented. In the future this playbook could be edited to fatally exit the ansible deployment if it has any of the deprecated configurations present. An alternative is simply to document the changes required in the upgrade notes or to implement some sort of tooling to handle the conversion permanently. Security impact --------------- None. Performance impact ------------------ None. End user impact --------------- Existing variables would need to be catered for and go through a deprecation cycle, or there would need to be some sort of upgrade script which converts old settings in user_config to the new method. The change to ansible.cfg would need to be handled - either through a documentation note, or by an automated script. Deployer impact --------------- There would need to be documentation produced which covers how to make use of this method, and also how to convert from the old method to the new method. Developer impact ---------------- This would reduce the need for developers to get involved with small patches that implement basic configuration file entries which deployers wish to use. Dependencies ------------ None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: https://launchpad.net/~jesse-pretorius IRC: odyssey4me Other contributors: None at this time. Work items ---------- Implement tunable configurations for: 1. keystone 2. glance 3. nova 4. cinder 5. neutron 6. heat 7. horizon 8. swift Testing ======= Some of the existing AIO tunables could be implemented in a seperate tunables file in conf.d which is used for the AIO specifically. This would provide an adequate test and illustration of how to make use of it. Documentation impact ==================== Please see the End User impact and Deployer impact sections.

The snmp declarative hardware pollster loads the metric definition from
a special yaml file and can poll those metrics. This enables the
developers to modify the yaml file only to add new snmp metrics without
writing any new python code.

Added a new classmethod interface build_pollsters for PollsterBase. The
pollster plugin which implements this interface should return a list of
tuple (name, pollster), where name is the meter name it will return, and
pollster is the pollster object instances. All the pollsters returned by
this would be wrapped in stevedore extensions in
PollsterBase.get_pollster_extensions().

This pollster doesn't get registered temporarily to avoid duplicating
samples. Will be registered in the following patches when old snmp
pollsters are deleted.

This patch adds a support of 'Murano Package' Glance artifact type to
the murano client. The ArtifactRepo class wraps the standard Glance's
V3 client and provides access to Glance Artifacts as to Murano
Packages.
Another class, called PackageManagerAdapter provides a temporary
facade which makes artifact-based packages compatible with the legacy
packages.

This change makes it so wildcards can be used in bandit.yaml when
configuring function calls that should be alerted on.  For example, it
allows 'telnetlib.*' to be set as a blacklist entry, and will then
alert on a call to telnetlib.Telnet() and any other functions in that
namespace.

It uses stdlib's fnmatch, which means the wildcards are Unix shell
style.

This change also hijacks the telnetlib import check, adding a wildcarded
blacklist calls check as described above and adjusting tests and
example naming accordingly.

The ceilometer audit events stored at the ceilometer database
currently don't have user_id/project_id associated with them
even though this information is available as part of the event
message payload. The user_id and project_id information has to
be stored as traits so that there's user/project context for each
event and these traits are required to apply RBAC-based rules
and filters on events. For eg., presence of these traits enable
db queries - like get all events for a project/user against events.
The audit event definition in the events yaml file already stores
payload.initiator.id as initiator_id but the initiator_id trait
is not a common trait across all events and thus this trait cannot
be used to apply RBAC filter against events.This changeset will
thus add user_id and project_id traits to the audit events namely
*.http.* and add useri_id and project_id as default traits for all
events.

We're seeing some neutron db sync failures in master branch (liberty).
It looks like there may be a few issues with the way we're handling
migrations:

1. We're not capturing the correct information in the 'Check last DB
   revision' task as the first line returned by 'neutron-db-manage
   history' is a header (this also means that the 'Inspect on disk
   neutron DB revision' task will never do what we intend).
2. We delegate 'Check last DB revision' to 'neutron_all' group, but in
   an ideal world this is probably only necessary on 'neutron_server'.
3. When stopping neutron server to run 'Perform a Neutron DB Upgrade',
   we're only stopping it on groups['neutron_server'][0], while all
   other neutron server containers are up servicing requests.
4. Perform a db stamp, which doesn't appear to be necessary.

This change makes the following changes:

1. Bumps neutron SHA to include 43c00a9, which introduces new
   --expand / --contract upgrade options (otherwise, you have to
   specify liberty_expand@head / liberty_contract@head which may no
   longer work when neutron gets bumped in the future)
2. Checks if migrations have previously run, and if not runs a
   'neutron-db-manage upgrade heads'
3. If migrations have previously run:
   a) it runs an online migration against expand alembic branch using
      'neutron-db-manage upgrade --expand'.
   b) it stops all neutron-server services
   c) it runs an offline migration against contract alembic branch
      using 'neutron-db-manage upgrade --contract'
   d) it starts all neutron-server instances
4. It removes the temporary pin introduced in
   https://review.openstack.org/218572 as the SHA bump includes the
   upstream fix https://review.openstack.org/218723

TODO: Currently, we upgrade expand and contract branches (shutting down
      neutron-server in the proceses), even if there are no pending
      migrations.  We need to find a clean way to check what migration
      we are on and compare to alembic HEADS file to see if we're up to
      date.  Unfortunately, 'neutron-db-manage current' doesn't indicate
      which migration is in which alembic branch, so you would have to
      further grep for each migration in the neutron migrations code to
      determine the branch.

NOTE: Liberty introduces the split alembic branches for online/offline
      migrations, see [1] for more information.

When importing backup metadata only required fields were being imported,
and all other fields were being ignored.

This led to some serious problems when importing backups back, since
you would lose not only the original Volume ID, but also relevant parent
id information needed to restore incremental backups.

This patch fixes this by importing everything back and creating backup
records with the right ID.

format version specified in manifest. As a consequence
it is now possible to use different YAQL engines for
different package format versions. Also startup
time was greatly improved as unneeded classes are no more
parsed and logos and UI forms are not loaded.

With this change MuranoPackage becomes first-class DSL citizen.
Packages have version, runtime_version (that is specified
in Format attribute of the manifest file) and a list of classes.
Previously engine used to have package loader which had most
of ""load"" functionality and class loader that mostly acted as an
adapter from package loader to interface that DSL used to
get classes. Now class loader is gone and is replaced with
package loader at the DSL level. Package loader is responsible
for loading packages by either package or class name (as it was
before) plus semantic_version spec (for example "">=1.2,<2.0"").
Package loader can now keep track of several versions of the same
package.

Also packages now have requirements with version specs.
All class names that are encountered in application code are
looked up within requirements only. As a consequence
packages that use other packages without referencing
them explicitly will become broken. An exception from this rule
is core library which is referenced automatically.

The functional tests included some tests for creating AES keys with
different bit lengths. Most of those bit lengths were not valid. The
tests can cause some secret stores to return failures because the key
lengths were not valid. The tests were also setting the bit length to
different values but not modifying the payload. The payload is now
being created for the appropriate bit length.

One of the tests was passing the algorithm and bit length as part of a

The tests that use non-standard algorithms or bit lengths were
decorated with a non-standard-algorithm attribute. This will allow

As Glance Program has decided not to release the client for
EXPERIMENTAL v3 API in its python-glanceclient library until the API
is considered stable, we cannot consume artifacts API from any of the
released glance clients.

It was decided (see [1]) to temporary copy the v3 client code from
python-glanceclient into the python-muranoclient so murano may consume
it without depending on custom builds of glance client. This patch
copies appropriate code.

Unfortunately, such a small timeout for hearbeats cause an incredible
regression for Astute <-> RabbitMQ connectivity.

Basically, if Astute's sending a huge message to RabbitMQ and by some
reason we aren't able to do it within 2 seconds (heartbeat timeout),
the connection will be dropped by RabbitMQ server.

In fact, that's happened on SWARM while

* Astute takes almost 100% CPU usage (bug #1491794)
* Astute's sending diagnostic snapshot result message to Nailgun
  (more than 4MB of data).

Since heartbeats aren't solve the problem we have tried to fix, let's
revert the original commit e24ca066bf6160bc1e419aaa5d486cad1aaa937d.

It exists to solve two problems that typically affect PKI deployments but that often go ignored by users; securely provision certificates in live environments is incredibly difficult and effectively revoking bad certificates is nearly impossible with the cryptographic libraries that are available to handle PKI operations today. Traditional Provisioning ------------------------ One of the challenges for managing PKI in large infrastructures is ensuring that certificates are provisioned securely and effectively. In traditional PKI a certificate signing request (CSR) would be created by a user who requires a certificate for some service that they are managing. The user would then typically submit that CSR to whatever corporate PKI system is in use, likely Dogtag_ or Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS_). That submission would then trigger a process of verification that often includes a PKI administrator manually inspecting that the various fields within the CSR and approving the issuing of a certificate. When the certificate is issued the original requestor needs to be notified, often by way of email - the requestor then accesses the CA and retrieves their newly signed certificate. .. _Dogtag: http://pki.fedoraproject.org/wiki/PKI_Main_Page .. _ADCS: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/dd448615.aspx This heavily manual process is fraught with opportunities for human error and tends to scale very poorly, while this workflow may have sufficed for managing the certificate that an organization might want to provision to it's edge to provide secure web services, it cannot cope with the massive numbers of certificates required for running large data-centers. Methods for automatically issuing certificates such as SCEP and ADCS auto-enrollment exist to help solve this problem but often require significant architectural changes to use them securely. For example, SCEP requires a secure network to work (if you had such a network you wouldn't need certificates) so is typically only used when infrastructure is provisioned - before being moved into production. ADCS auto-enrollment requires all of your servers to be running on Microsoft Windows, which is often not the case for large scale cloud-type environments. Anchor provides an alternative mechanism for provisioning certificates that allows each server in a cluster to request it's own certificate while enforcing strong issuing policies that introduce capabilities beyond those that can be leveraged by the manual process described above - and it can do it at large scale. Anchor Provisioning ------------------- Anchor expects that a machine which requires a certificate will request it directly, rather than some user requesting it and then installing it on the machine. This requires the machine to somehow track existing certificates and request new ones when they expire. There are many ways to approach this and often a simple cron.d bash script will suffice. The Cathead_ and Certmonger_ projects both exist to help with system based certificate management but only Cathead natively supports Anchor, however Certmonger can be modified to work with Anchor if required. .. _Cathead: https://github.com/stackforge/cathead .. _Certmonger: https://fedorahosted.org/certmonger/ Anchor provides multiple ways for machines to authenticate with it, primarily LDAP, Keystone and a pre-shared Username/Password combination. The fact that each machine, if configured to do so, can independently request it's own certificate with separate credentials allows Anchor to make very fine grained decisions regarding which machines should be given certificates, allowing administrators to focus on policies for certificate issuing. There's more information on Anchor auth in the Authentication_ section Along with fine grained access control Anchor supports various validators_ that can be used by PKI administrators to set tight policy constraints on what is allowed within a certificate. These validators provide a powerful construct for programmatically verifying that a certificate meets policy requirements for a particular environment. .. _authentication: .. _validators: Traditional Revocation ---------------------- Certificates can require revocation for a number of reasons, they may no longer be required, they may have been incorrectly issued or the private key for a certificate may have been compromised. There are two methods that exist for revoking certificates; Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL_) and the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP_). Unfortunately neither system is particularly robust when attempting to use them within dynamic, large scale environments. CRLs are updated only periodically and have significant scale issues when used within systems that change certificates regularly. OCSP was created to address a number of the issues that hinder CRLs but unfortunately are very poorly supported in cryptographic libraries outside of web-browser software. Using OCSP incurs some infrastructure overhead because it needs to maintain a level of availability that normally requires it to be load balanced to ensure that a responder is always available, not receiving an OCSP response will cause a client to not trust a certificate. .. _CRL: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt .. _OCSP: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960 To recap; CRLs don't work terribly well in large scale, dynamic environments where multiple certificates might be required in a machines lifetime as it is repurposed.

This change allows to set the reboot timeout in libvirt domain if the
image metadata (property-name ""hw_reboot_timeout"") or flavor extra spec
(name ""hw:reboot_timeout"") is configured to set it.
This reboot timeout controls whether and after how long the guest
should start booting again in case the boot fails.
The value is in milliseconds with maximum of 65535 and special value -1
(default) disables the reboot.
It is especially advantageous in combination with a boot menu enabled,
since in that case the user can select for error a non bootable volume.

When creating a router, you can specify an external network as a
gateway, but since it requires the network ID it's not something you
can specify statically in a task config. This adds a new option,
set_gateway, to dynamically set the external gateway of a router to
the network that is created as part of the scenario.

This also adds a new function to the Neutron utils, _create_routers,
that creates a network and a given number of subnets and routers.

Since Barbican's backend depends on limited resources (database and plugin storage space), this can be an issue in a multi-project or multi-user environment when one project can exhaust available resources, impacting other projects. The answer to this, on a per-project basis, is project quotas. This quick start guide will show you how a user can lookup his current effective quotas and how a service admin can set, read, and delete project quota configuration for all projects in his cloud. This guide will assume you will be using a local running development environment of Barbican. If you need assistance with getting set up, please reference the :doc:`development guide </setup/dev>`. .. _quick_project_quotas_overview: Project Quotas Overview ####################### All users authenticated with Barbican are able to read the effective quota values that apply to their project. Barbican can derive the project that a user belongs to by reading the project scope from the authentication token. Service administrators can read, set, and delete quota configurations for each project known to Barbican. The service administrator is recognized by his authenticated role. The service administrator's role is defined in Barbican's policy.json file. The default role for a service admin is ""key-manager:service-admin"". Quotas can be enforced for the following barbican resources: secrets, containers, orders, and consumers. The configured quota value can be None (use the default), -1 (unlimited), 0 (disabled), or a positive integer defining the maximum number allowed for a project. .. _default_project_quotas: Default Quotas -------------- When no project quotas have been set for a project, the default project quotas are enforced for that project. Default quotas are specified in the Barbican configuration file. The defaults provided in the standard configuration file are as follows. .. code-block:: json {""quotas"": {""secrets"": -1, ""orders"": -1, ""containers"": -1, ""consumers"": -1 } } The default quotas are returned on **GET** on the **quotas** resource when no explicit project quotas have been set for the current project. .. _quick_get_quotas: How to Read Effective Quotas ############################ The current effective quotas for a project can be read via a **GET** to the **quotas** resource.

Link to blueprint: * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+spec/named-veths Problem description =================== All veth interfaces on the host are named using randomly-generated names, such as `vethK070G4`. This can make troublshooting container networking issues more challenging since it's difficult to trace a veth name to a particular network interface within the container. Proposed change =============== Names of veth interfaces should be unique and easily correlated to their containers. However, names of network interfaces have restrictions which must be handled carefully: * 16 characters maximum * Certain characters, like dashes (-) aren't allowed The random characters on the end of the container hostname could be used along with the interface name to form a veth name. As an example, a container called `aio1_utility_container-a9ef9551` could have two named veth interfaces: * a9ef9551_eth0 * a9ef9551_eth1 Alternatives ------------ Leave veth names as randomly-generated by LXC. Playbook/Role impact -------------------- The veth names will only be adjusted on the host. Containers won't be affected. The playbooks don't use the veth names on the host for any actions. Upgrade impact -------------- Upgrades should be unaffected. If a container is running and its LXC configuration file is adjusted to use named veths, it will only utilize those adjustments when it is restarted. If an upgrade happens to restart only a subset of the containers on the host, then only those containers will use named veths after they restart. Security impact --------------- This change shouldn't affect security. Performance impact ------------------ This change shouldn't affect performance. End user impact --------------- This change shouldn't affect end users. Deployer impact --------------- Users who deploy OpenStack should be able to troubleshoot network issues more efficiently. For example, if a user was having trouble reaching the nova API container, they could quickly see which veths were associated with the container. This would allow users to diagnose network problems with various tools, like ethtool and tcpdump, without digging into interface indexes or writing scripts. Developer impact ---------------- Much like the deployer impact above, this change could help developers diagnose issues within different containers more efficiently. Dependencies ------------ This spec has no known dependencies. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: https://launchpad.net/~rackerhacker ``mhayden`` Work items ---------- * Update ansible playbooks to specify `lxc.network.veth.pair` in the main LXC configuration files as well as the interface .ini files Testing ======= * Do greenfield deployment and verify named veths * Do an upgrade between releases and verify named veths as well as no impact to running containers Documentation impact ==================== Documentation would be beneficial, especially around how this helps with troubleshooting issues.

Existing rsync stop/start handlers were relying on the pattern
parameter to the Ansible service module which relies on the results
of ps to determine if the service is running. This is unnecessary
because the rsync service script is well-behaved and responds
appropriately to start stop and restart commands. Removal of the
pattern param ensures that the response from the service command is
used instead.

Root cause of the bug is that when Keystone was changed to share
fernet secrets via rsync over ssh tunnel, an rsync process was
introduced in AIOs, Swift stand-alones, and other deployment
configurations that contain Keystone containers on the storage hosts.

The resulting rsync processes within Keystone containers pollute the
results of ps commands on the host, fooling Ansible into thinking
that an rsync service is running on the standard port when it is not.

Secondly, the handler responsible for stopping rsync was not causing
the notice for ""Ensure rsync service running"" to trigger cleanly in
my testing, so the tasks were changed to trigger both notices in an
ordered list.

We make sure that rebuild now uses claims and resource tracking. This
means that we will now be properly tracking resources for
rebuilt/evacuated instances and will potentially fail if a move of the
instance breaks policy set by the scheduler (an exception would be in
case we bypassed the scheduler).

We also make sure that we update the migration record with the current
status (either success or failure).

On a failure to claim, we will currently just error out the instance
which requires manual intervention, but taking advantage of the retry
mechanism could be added in the future.

Since none of the required args are sent yet, this change is effectively
a no-op, until we change the rebuild_instance RPC method to send the
required data over.

When read_affinity is used and sorting_method is not used warnings
are generated in the swift proxy log indicating that the
read_affinity is not being respected. When read_affinity is specified
this change sets the sorting_method to affinity automatically, and
otherwise uses a configured value which defaults to shuffle.

Note that write_affinity does not respect sorting_method and follows
a different code path and does not issue warnings in logs when used
without sorting_method.

Problem description =================== Murano is a complex system that comprises from a number of services and technologies including several domain specific/markup languages. All of them evolve and change from release to release. New futures are introduced, code is being refactored and not always remains compatible with previous release. But applications written for previous Murano versions must still work on newer releases otherwise all applications would require at least retesting and often code changes on each release. Proposed change =============== Because there are many different parts in Murano that can break and need versioning support to manage backward compatibility. Murano packages versioning '''''''''''''''''''''''''' Version of Murano package is stored in package manifest in **PackageVersion** attribute. The only purpose of this attribute is to indicate compatibility between different versions of the same package. Two packages are said to be compatible if package of a newer version can be used instead of package with lower version number. MuranoPL classes also have versions that are always equal to a version of package they located in. Version string has a form **major.minor.revision** with default “1.0.0”. Version numbers have a strong semantics. I.e. there are strict rules on when those numbers can be changed. Major version number indicated a breaking change in package API. It is incremented when one of the following happens: * Class is removed from package * Public method or property is removed from any class in the package * Public method changes argument signature to incompatible with previous one. For example argument removed or added without default value * Any other change (including in class behavior) that can break class consumers (callers) Classes of different major version are assumed to be incompatible until it is explicitly stated to be compatible or adapter class exists that can be used to transform the class to a newer version. Minor version change means change that is compatible with existing consumers (callers) but not necessary with class descendants. It is incremented when one of the following happens: * New class is introduced in the package * New method or property is introduced in any package’s class * Record added to “Extends” list of any class * Any other interface (including behavior) change that doesn’t break external class users but can possibly break class inheritors Revision number is changed when the package remains compatible with both callers and descendants but introduces behavior changes: * Any changes in class implementation (in workflow, scripts, resources, license, logo, UI forms etc.) that cannot break class consumers and inheritors but affect user experience and/or modifies functionality provided by the class * Default value of property/argument changed If minor or revision parts are absent they assumed to be equal to 0. Thus None = 1 = 1.0 = 1.0.0 and 1.0 = 1.0.0 < 1.0.1 < 1.1.0 < 1.1.100 < 1.2.1 Minor number must be reset to zero with each major version increment but revision is not and thus can be made monotonic. Also there is no requirement to increment versions by 1 and this may be used to indicate significance of change (for example major version by 100 for real big changes while incrementing by 1 if the classes are incompatible only in some rare corner case. Note that it really doesn’t matter how small or big the change was. It might be the case when major version is incremented for negligible change while major improvement will result only in revision number change. Because of this is might have sense to add another version attribute (say free-form **DisplayVersion**) that would contain user-facing version that would not be interpreted by the engine. Besides PackageVersion there is also an optional **ReleaseDate** attribute in package manifest that contains ISO-8601 formatted value. Typically this value is put into package manifest by package assembly script that uses date-time of a last commit to modify the package. If the attribute is absent upload date-time is used instead. The purpose of this attribute is to have ability to release hot-patches/security fixes that would have exactly the same PackageVersion but later ReleaseDate and thus will completely replace older package Class compatibility ''''''''''''''''''' Each MuranoPL class will have optional attribute **CompatibleVersion** defying the lowest **major** version number this class is compatible with. The class assumed to be compatible with all major versions in between CompatibleVersion and class own version. If the attribute is absent it is assumed to equal to major version component of the class itself. In other words it is compatible within single major version. Here term compatibility means compatibility from a point of view of external consumers. Package requirements '''''''''''''''''''' Packages may require other packages for their work. Those requirements are expressed via **Require** key in package manifest. It has a form of Require: package1_FQN: version_string ... packageN_FQN: version_string Upon package upload/validation it is checked that required package exist. It is required that package with exactly the same major and minor version be found and revision number must not be less than the specified. Thus requirement of version = “1” is invalid, and “1.0” is okay. All packages considered to be dependent on “io.murano” package. If such requirement is absent from the list (or the list is empty or even there is no Require key in package manifest) then dependency “io.murano: 1.0” (core library) is automatically added (for package types other than MuranoPL default version may differ) Object version '''''''''''''' Object in Object Model are also versioned using class version (= package version) of a class used to instantiate the object. The version is stored in “?”/”classVersion” attribute of each object. If it is not present “1.0.0” is assumed. Side by side versioning of packages ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' Package versioning implies that several versions of the same package (and in turn of the same class) can be used simultaneously. Currently application catalog requires fully qualified class name to be unique but with versioning the pair (FQN, version) must be unique. Packages with release date greater than the release date of existing class with the same name and version it is automatically overwritten by uploaded package otherwise an error raised (displayed). When one class inherits another or instantiates an object of another class the following is done: 1. From application catalog index it is inferred a FQN of package containing the class 2. If found package is of the same name as our package use the class from our package 3. Otherwise from available versions of found package select those having the same major and minor version as specified in package requirement 4. If requirement is specified using 3-part version string prefer the version with the exact version match 5. If there is no exact version match use version with largest revision number available. If requirement was specified using 2-part version string assume revision number to equal to 0. 6. If appropriate version was not found by this time the warning is issued. If the class is present in one of a packages in Require list but there is no matching version the latest version with the same major version component is used. This behavior can be disabled in Murano config. If it is not then the latest version used (this requires even more permissive configuration setting that should not be set by default). 7. Fail as a last resort Note that if class appeared in different packages over time all of them combined into a single list. When the class in expected to be passed from outside (using class() contract of property/argument) the following is done: 1. From application catalog index it is inferred a FQN of package containing the class 2. Examine version of a passed object. If the major version component is equal and minor version that is greater or equal to to that from package requirement use the object. 3. If object has a higher major version see object’s class definition if it is explicitly stated to be compatible with our (older) major version. Otherwise try to build shortest adapter chain to transform older class to required version. 4. If we failed to get compatible version to this point fail with contract violation error Class adapters '''''''''''''' Adapters are special classes that convert between interfaces of incompatible versions of the same class. Adapters are one way e.g. convert from exactly one major version to the version of itself. Adapter classes are ordinary MuranoPL classes that inherit target class and provided with an instance of a source class. Usually the class override incompatible methods to transform them into a calls to an inner object of an older type. Adapter classes are separate from regular classes, put into a special “Adapters” folder inside package and treated specially by the engine. They cannot be instantiated directly and used implicitly as part of contract handling code and cast() function. Adapter classes have additional attribute to indicate source class version and enjoy additional syntax sugar to simplify their development that is not available to regular classes. Such feature will probably require some additions to MuranoPL (like property getters to return property values of inner object) that are planned independently of versioning. Class adapters may be chained to convert between a distant versions. Engine always tries to build a shortest chain of adapters. For example if there are adapters 1 -> 4, 4 -> 5 and 4 -> 6 then if the engine wants to convert from version 2 to version 6 it will use 1(2) -> 4 => 4 -> 6 chain rather than 1(2) -> 4 => 4 -> 5 => 4(5) -> 6 Adapters are indexed separately by the app catalog. Exact syntax for adapters are yet to be designed. Engine versioning ''''''''''''''''' Each package has a manifest attribute named **Format** of a form [PackageType/]Version where PackageType is a language used for the package with “MuranoPL” as a default and Version is a 3-component version string similar to that of package versions with a similar semantics and same shortening rules (None = 1 = 1.0 = 1.0.0). Version indicates minimum engine/language version to run. Language, engine and manifest format versions are tight together into a single version. We assume that all of above are backward compatible or internally can handle differences between versions. Engine internally knows what changed in each version and can use that knowledge to emulate behavior of older versions. UI forms versioning ''''''''''''''''''' UI forms are versioned using Format attribute inside YAML definition. The only way to stay compatible with older format versions is either to support several different formats internally in dashboard or have auto-conversion utility that will upgrade forms on package upload. API versioning '''''''''''''' If single API service can handle several API versions simultaneously it should be done via endpoint prefixes (/v1/, /v2/ etc.). Otherwise there should be several separate services listening on different ports and registered with different names in Keystone. We assume that dashboard-API-engine are always consistent and upgraded as the whole. We also assume to be acceptable for different API versions to have separate databases or tables so that environments created with one version would not be visible to APIs of other versions. API <-> Engine communication versioning ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' Because API might require to handle requests from different API versions version number must be added to JSON tasks that API send to the engine. All responses from engine must contain exactly the same version. If engine is to send out of band notifications to the API different versions of API should use different queue names (or any other information that would allow sending notifications to exact recipient) and that information must be provided in original task request. oslo.messaging supports versioning of RPC API, we may employ this here, e.g. have api version = engine rpc version Engine <-> Murano Agent communication versioning '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' This topic is addressed by Unified Agent specification Alternatives ------------ Keep strict backward compatibility without ability tp introduce breaking changes. Data model impact ----------------- * Need to store version number for each versioned entity in the database * In many cases uniqueness must be constrained by name and version number rather than by name alone * Requirements for each package need to be stored in database as well REST API impact --------------- None Versioning impact ----------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Deployer impact --------------- All versions of released packages should be available simultaneously. That implies that for core library and other essential packages instead of importing only those packages at system installation all versions of those libraries need to be imported. If there would be several independent API services it would require additional deployment efforts. Developer impact ---------------- Development process need to be changed for correct version tracking. Here is an example how it can be organized: * For each released version of the package there is a separate folder called after version number plus one additional folder called “dev” * During development all changes go to “dev” folder. All packages and requirements have a version “0.0.0” effectively turning versioning off. * After code freeze release manager assign version number to the version about to be released by examining commits happened between releases. It is advised to mark such commits somehow (for example [changes major version], [changes minor version], [changes revision] or something similar). * Requirements may be defined more accurately from the same source * New folder for released version is created and final version of the “dev” package is put there. * Bug/fix and backport commits can be made in between modifying either already released package or making a copy of it with different revision version number according to versioning requirements. * We should write a script to package/upload packages from such versioned folder (e.g. producing a package for each released version) Murano-dashboard / Horizon impact --------------------------------- All uploaded packages fall into 3 categories: * Default package version. That is explicitly marked package version that is used by default when user adds component/application to environment. There can be no more than one such version. If no version was selected to be default the latest version is automatically used for that purpose. * Additional versions. This is all other component versions user is allowed to choose. If user wants to add non-default component version it clicks on a special button/submenu item and selects the version from a list of known versions * Hidden versions. When package is deleted and there is at least one environment alive using it package is not removed but marked as a hidden. Hidden packages are not accessible from dashboard but re-appear if they got re-uploaded. Administrators need to be able to explicitly hide any version of any component. If component is created to fulfill requirements of another component and default version for that component is not version-compatible with requirement dashboard might be smart enough to automatically detect that fact and ask user for a version or use latest compatible version (which is also should be default for the first option) Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Stan Lagun <istalker2> Work Items ---------- * Add support for version numbers and package requirements to manifests and corresponding API/database scheme * Make engine aware of class versions. Allow to have several classes of the same name but different versions is single class loader * Implement version compatibility rules * Improve MuranoPL type resolution rules to include versioning * Design how to implement adapters (may require changes to MuranoPL) Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= In general after each release we should try to old applications on new release to make sure that nothing broke (which may happen if versioning rules were not followed correctly). But it is clear that in practice this cannot be done for all applications in catalog. So we may peek selected set of applications and to try to deploy all versions of those applications on current release. This set should be representative to test the most possible set of futures. Subset of those applications can be used for per-commit tests. Documentation Impact ==================== Changes introduced by each version change of each component should be documented with a guide how to upgrade/migrate existing code.

Pyngus 2.0 includes a new API for configuring SASL credentials.
Previous versions of Pyngus did not provide this API - the driver had
to invoke Proton APIs in order to configure user credentials.  Moving
to the Pyngus API will preserve compatibility with older versions of
Proton, since the next release of Proton wil be changing its SASL API.

Pyngus 2.0 also adds strict enforcement of callback re-entrancy

 - Cannot rebuild a VM created from a Cinder volume backed by NetApp
   https://review.openstack.org/203253

This patch removes all SHA specifications for the OpenStack clients
so that any client requirement versions are determined solely from
the requirements of the OpenStack service and Global requirements
files.

This resolves issues where the client versions we carry are
incompatible with the services, resulting in unexpected failures.

Tempest requirements are specifically ignored as the tempest role
downloads its required clients directly from pip.

Finally, due to the change in the openstack-client version used the
heat domain/role/user tasks fail as they require the CLI to specify
the user and project domain name/id. This patch includes the CLI
changes to ensure that the deployment completes properly.

This bug is triggered when haproxy is deployed on multiple hosts
and external_lb_vip is different than the internal one.
As all host receive the same configuration, and are expected
to restart the haproxy service more than once
(once during role and once post_tasks), the playbook will fail,
because the restart of the service fails. The restart of the
service fails on some hosts because haproxy tries to
start/bind to an ip the host doesn't have (avoiding ip conflicts)

This allows haproxy to bind on non_local addresses by
addng a sysctl change in the playbook: net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1
The sysctl is changed for the containers/systems
when external_lb_vip is different than internal address and
the number of haproxy hosts is more than one thanks to a group_var.

Side-effect: other services are able to bind on non-local addresses
if the sysctl is changed.

This could be overriden by setting the variable haproxy_bind_on_non_local
in your user_* variables. If set to false, then the ip_non_local_bind
sysctl won't be changed.

After this patch was merged: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/190601/
Rally gates become broken.

The check in jenkis/jobs/rally.yaml that should switch to new
plugin style doesn't work (it contains bug).
At this moment we are installing 2 versions of Rally
(with new and old way) one is master another one is master + patch.

As a result Rally gates are testing Rally master instead of
proposed patch to Rally.

This patch removes check of new/old style and use always new plugin style

After the service split, some of the configuration, parsing and
validation was kept in the neutron core; ultimately this needs to
get closer to the services where it belongs.

This patch starts from ProviderConfiguration and ServiceTypeManager
classes, and aims at removing the hard-coded elements, like the list
of known advanced services, so that in the long run we can make
Neutron easier to plug with external services.

As per https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/deprecate-v1-api
the Cinder API v1 was designated as deprecated in Juno and was meant
to be removed in Kilo, but appears to still be usable in Kilo.

This patch configures Nova to use the Cinder v2 API instead of the
v1 API.

This patch configures Tempest to test both the Cinder v1 and v2 API's
for now. Once the API is removed upstream we can change this.

IMAGE_URLS could be set both in localrc with customization or stackrc by
default. By setting DOWNLOAD_DEFAULT_IMAGES, user could choose to add
default images to IMAGE_URLS or overwrite them.

As uploading duplicate images will cause a ""409 Conflict"" error, a
duplicate detection will expose it earlier.

Care needs to be taken that you don't end up with a duplicate image, so
clean up Xen's README.
