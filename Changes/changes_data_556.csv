This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =================== SkyDive integration =================== Relevant launchpad RFE: https://bugs.launchpad.net/dragonflow/+bug/1749429 Currently we do not have an easy way to visualize the way Dragonflow sees the topology and the relations between objects. This view is important both for operators using the project, and for developers trying to debug the system. To solve this, we would like to leverage one of the SkyDive [1]_ project capabilities - being a good topologies visualization tool. This will allow us to concentrate on the building of the overall topology view (skydive model) and use the skydive for all the different ways to visualize and dissect the information (skydive view). Problem Description =================== Add the ability to view the topology as known by DragonFlow in a graphical way. This feature is needed to allow easier debugging of issues in flows and understanding the behaviour of DragonFlow. Implementation stages: 1. Have a view of the topology of a specific network node 2. Have real-time updates of the information (items added/removed) 3. Allow aggregation of the information and have a global view of the topology 4. Allow filtering and dissecting of the information to show just specific parts. 5. Allow simulation or tracing of packets in the system on the graphical interface. All of these features are supported by skydive project, but for other collectors, we should implement our own collector (or a way to send the information to the analyser) in a way that will be out-of-band with the operation of the controller (or at least not block it for long periods) and allow an administrator (rather than developer) easy access and debugging of the system. Proposed Change =============== Add one Skydive analyzer with one (or more) collectors. The collectors are responsible to collect the topology information, translate it to the skydive model structure and send it to the analyzer. The Analyzer, in turn, is responsible to aggregate the information and for the displaying of the information, with/without filtering requested by the end-user (be it a developer / integrator / operator). The collectors will run on the Dragonflow nodes (network nodes) as a separate service (not within the controller) for several reasons: 1. We do not want to affect the performance of the controller. Each update sent to the analyzer may take up to a few seconds, in which time the controller will not be able to service other requests. 2. The code running in the controller must be monkey_patched. This creates different limitations on our code. Integration should be done in several stages: 1. Create a basic service that runs every given period and sends an update of the elements in the system to the analyzer. 2. Support removal of objects. 3. Handle cases of disconnect/reauthentication to the analyzer 4. Handle cases of disconnect/reconnect to the nb_db 5. Add a mechanism in which the skydive_service will get notification of objects that were added-to/removed-from the topology to have an experience that is closer to real-time as opposed to periodic updates. 6. Specify an API for DragonFlow applications to add custom information to the topology view (e.g. port-behind-port) and relevant metadata to be used in the view filtering. 7. Better the visualization (custom icons, etc.) Open issues / feature discussion: ================================= - How do we get the topology change notifications? As we are an external application we disable the pubsub feature, so we should have a different way of getting these notifications. - Consider whether our code should create the views filters or leave it up to the user/operator. - Do we want to support the option to emulate a passing of a packet through the system? Is it supported by SkyDive? - Do we want to support visualization of tracing of packets in our system? What is required on our side to visualize it on SkyDive? References ========== ..

When the repo container is removed, the apt cache config
is still in place and causes problems. This is due to the
tasks running to remove the cache configuration not
executing early enough in the deployment.

This patch re-orders the tasks so that the removal can
be done and the cache is updated afterwards to confirm
a working state.

It also makes the configuration happen on all hosts, then
all containers, at the right timings to ensure that if the
container is removed, the proxy config will also be removed
automatically.

This is not related to the Cinder image cache.

In order to speed up the creation of multiple volumes from a single
snapshot this change adds a cache of volumes created by merging a
snapshots backing chain to the Quobyte driver.
This behaviour can be activated via a new config option
'quobyte_volume_from_snapshot_cache'.
Instead of merging a snapshots backing chain into a new volume each time
a volume is created from this snapshot, the new implementation merges the
backing chain into a volume in the new volume cache. New volumes to be
created from that snapshot are then copied from the cached volume and
no longer require the merging process.
Merging happens only for the first time when the cached volume copy is
created from a specific snapshot. Subsequent creations of volumes from
this snapshot are simply copied from the cache which requires no costly
backing chain merge.

This patch updates the link to point to the Horizon docs.

When 'NetApp NFS Copy Offload' tool is configured to download Glance
images, these images are downloaded twice because the tool is doing
the job after Cinder has already done it.
This patch fixes the bug by executing the copy offload tool inside the
clone_image function instead of using the copy_image_to_volume.

Most of the HTTP servers default max body size to 1MB, Apache, Nginx.
That default value is ok as long as users mostly get data from server
but when something needs to be uploaded, 1MB limit is often not enough.
This is what we see with Heat and some of the large templates.
It's not uncommon that WSGI apps have 10MB+ body size limit,
so with the current Heat default value we are still in low range sizes.

Original Heat template HeatMaxJsonBodySize default value was 1M and now
it will be 4M. There is aslo corresponding change in instack-undercloud

The script called destroy-patch-ports will break connection between the
integration bridge and provider bridges configured in Neutron config
files. See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1490281 for more
details about the reason.

With systemd, we have control over dependencies between services,
therefore we can tell that destroy-patch-ports service must be run
before neutron-openvswitch-agent. But we do not have this ability using
docker. That's why this patch simply calls the script before each start
of the agent. To avoid unnecessary breakage of patch ports, the script
was enhanced to check a canary flow on integration bridge and in case
the flow is there, it will not delete the patch ports. Presence of
canary flow on integration bridge means that bridge has been already
configured. It also implies provider bridges are configured too and thus
they can't cause the ARP storm as described in Red Hat Bugzilla 1490281.

This reverts commit 458840ddb12164c27054413bb7a7ffcd168b614e.

We've seen a spike in scheduling failures since this merged,
presumably because the scheduler doesn't have the latest
information and thinks the storage backend is at capacity.

There are situations where it would be advantageous to let
an operator specify custom per-service options.
One such use case seen in the wild is to extend the timeout of the cinder
because due to the specific storage backend these cinder operations
sometimes take a bit longer. Letting the user tweak the
haproxy_default_timeout is likely not what we want as for the case
above we only want to tweak a single service.

We explored another approach to fix this by adding a bunch of
<service>_options class parameters in the tripleo::haproxy class but it
made it extremely bloated and confusing, so we opted for this approach
which is much less invasive both code-wise and complexity-wise

Tested by deploying with:
ExtraConfig:
  tripleo::haproxy::cinder::options:
    ""timeout client"": '90m'
    'timeout server': '90m'

And observing the following cinder haproxy stanza:
listen cinder
  bind 10.0.0.4:8776 transparent
  bind 172.16.2.9:8776 transparent
  mode http
  http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Proto https if { ssl_fc }
  http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Proto http if !{ ssl_fc }
  option httpchk

In the unit tests' setUp, it was setting self.mock_rbd = mock_rbd
(where mock_rbd is the argument passed by @mock.patch.object) and
setting all sorts of properties onto self.mock_rbd, but mock_rbd
would become invalid after setUp finished, as the mock.patch

mock_rados.

Updating OpenStack (within release) means updating ODL from v1 to v1.1.
This is done by ""openstack overcloud update"" which collects
update_tasks. ODL needs 2 different steps to achieve this
minor update. These are called Level1 and Level2. L1 is
simple - stop ODL, update, start. This is taken care by paunch
and no separate implementation is needed. L2 has extra steps
which are implemented in update_tasks and post_update_tasks.

Updating ODL within the same major release (1->1.1) consists of either
L1 or L2 steps. These steps are decided from ODLUpdateLevel parameter
specified in environments/services-docker/update-odl.yaml.

Upgrading ODL to the next major release (1.1->2) requires
only the L2 steps. These are implemented as upgrade_tasks and
post_upgrade_tasks in https://review.openstack.org/489201.

Steps involved in level 2 update are
 1. Block OVS instances to connect to ODL
 2. Set ODL upgrade flag to True
 3. Start ODL
 4. Start Neutron re-sync and wait for it to finish
 5. Delete OVS groups and ports
 6. Stop OVS
 7. Unblock OVS ports
 8. Start OVS
 9. Unset ODL upgrade flag

These steps are exactly same as upgrade_tasks.
The logic implemented is:
follow upgrade_tasks; when update_level == 2

Since the WebOb 1.7 release webob doesn't natively support receiving
chunked transfer encoding bodies. [1] When glance is run under the
eventlet wsgi server this was fine, because eventlet will dechunk the
input on read() (or readline()) calls, so from the webob perspective
it's just a file object. However, the effort to remove the dependence
on using eventlet as the web server and deploy glance as a traditional
wsgi script we lose this mechanism. The wsgi spec doesn't provide a
consistent mechanism

When we run glance under uwsgi the uwsgi server provides an api to read
chunked data. [2] However, we need to explicitly call that api when to
dechunk the data and pass it to glance code which expects a file object.
This commit solves this issue by creating a fake file class that will
call the chunked_read() api from uwsgi on read() calls. This object is
then used if we're running the api code under uwsgi and the body has a
chunked transfer-encoding.

In OpenStack as it exists each project has created its own view of scheduling its resources that that project *maintains*. This is great for getting a project going quickly and for ensuring that the project functions correctly with those resources under load, under upgrades and such. It though does not create a `local optimum`_ that scheduling can achieve, in that there is no way to schedule in a more *global* manner. To move beyond localized scheduling this spec will start to discuss how we can move away from this existing model and work toward scheduling that can achieve a more `global optimum`_. This will obviously have side-effects for the OpenStack ecosystem as a whole and will directly impact how each project operates and the functionality it provides. .. _local optimum: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_optimum .. _global optimum: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_optimum Problem description =================== <WIP> Proposed change =============== <WIP> Alternatives ------------ <WIP> Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- * All the reviewers, code creators, PTL(s) of OpenStack?

We know how many image tasks there will be so instead of doing
a somewhat arbitrary sleep as we try to wait until all the image
tasks have been processed (by looking at the underlying queue
work) we can just use a simple barrier/latch concept that blocks
the main thread until all the images that we expect to be processed

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Spot Instances Support ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/spot-instances Cloud computing may give users the illusion of infinite capacity, but it is not always like this. Sometimes the resources are full, and a request may not be satisfied, failing with an error. In such cases, the usage of spot instances may be useful. Problem description =================== Currently instances are only spawned if there are available resources so satisfy the request. There is no way to prioritise a request against another, and there is no way a request could preempt a running instance. A spot instance is a special kind of instance that can be stopped or suspended if there are no resources available to satisfy a non-spot request. This way a user may launch spot instances, at a lower prize, taking into account that they may be terminated (or suspended) at a given point, without further advise. This kind of instances are quite useful to satisfy fault-tolerant requests, such as batch processing tasks. Proposed change =============== The aim of this blueprint is to introduce initial support for spot instances into nova. In order to tag an instance as an spot instance, the extra_specs attribute of a flavor will be used. This way, any instance spawned using that flavor, will become a spot instance. This makes possible that an operator can define precisely what instance types can be requested as a spot instance. Whenever a non-spot request cannot be satisfied, the scheduler will look into the running spot instances (if any) and will check if stopping some of them will release the needed resources for the new request. If the request can be satisfied, the scheduler will then stop that instances and the new request will be eventually scheduled into that slot. Alternatives ------------ It is possible to modify the scheduler to introduce priorities into the requests What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one. Data model impact ----------------- There should be no changes to the data model, since the extra_specs field of the flavors will be used to tag an instance as a spot one. REST API impact --------------- This BP does not affect REST APIs. Security impact --------------- This BP does not introduce any security issues. Notifications impact -------------------- Extra notifications will be raised when a machine is terminated due to the preemption by another instance. Other end user impact --------------------- The end users will have a new type of instance type to take into consideration. They should be aware that any spot instance can be stopped at a given point, without further advise. Performance Impact ------------------ To be done. Other deployer impact --------------------- To be done. Developer impact ---------------- To be done.

These networks are management (with node's BMC controllers), provisioning and cleaning (if used). This can be done with physical or logical network isolation, traffic filtering etc. * Some nodes supports more that one management technologies (vendor and IPMI) for example. If you use only one modern technology for out of band node access it's recommended to disable IPMI. IPMI protocol is not very secure and if IPMI enabled in most cases local OS administrator is able to work in band with IPMI settings without any credentials (it's not an issue, it's DCMI specification requirements). * Services with node's boot files (TFTP and HTTP) should serve requests only from networks where nodes deployed and cleaned. TFTP protocol does not support per user access control at all, for HTTP there is no generic and safe way to transfer credentials to the node. * There are two public (unauthorized) endpoints in ironic API intended for ramdisk. These endpoints can be potentially security issue. Access to these endpoints from outside should be prohibited. Easy way to do this is setup two group of API services: one for external requests, second for ramdisks requests. For disabling unauthorized access to ramdisk's endpoints for API group that serve external requests these lines should be added to ``policy.json`` file:: # Send heartbeats from IPA ramdisk ""baremetal:node:ipa_heartbeat"": ""rule:is_admin"" # Access IPA ramdisk functions ""baremetal:driver:ipa_lookup"": ""rule:is_admin""",,35,0

As current kuryr job is not even installing networking-ovn nor kuryr,
this patch is removing it. Even if we decide to fix it [0], its value
is still unclear since we would be depending on more projects and
we would have to run kuryr's tempest tests instead of ours.

As kuryr folks are setting up a new job to their gate using OVN as
a backend [1], let's remove this job from networking-ovn gate for now
and run their Zuulv3 job to the experimental pipeline.

This template should be in ReSTructured text. For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html To test out your formatting, build the docs using tox, or see: http://rst.ninjs.org The filename in the git repository should match the launchpad URL, for example a URL of https://blueprints.launchpad.net/oslo?searchtext=awesome-thing should be named awesome-thing.rst. For specs targeted at a single project, please prefix the first line of your commit message with the name of the project. For example, if you're submitting a new feature for oslo.config, your git commit message should start something like: ""config: My new feature"". Wrap text at 79 columns.

If you have nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None If you would like to provide a diagram with your spec, ascii diagrams are required. http://asciiflow.com/ is a very nice tool to assist with making ascii diagrams. The reason for this is that the tool used to review specs is based purely on plain text. Plain text will allow review to proceed without having to look at additional files which can not be viewed in gerrit.

change adds the ceph upgrade step during the FFU procedure.

In addition it moves the ceph parameters convert script to common directory

A lot of people are very surprised that we no longer reference port
35357 in our Ubuntu (and SUSE) install guides. Add a note to clarify
that this is not a bug and we do really mean it.

This does not change the RDO install guide because our guide still

This gets us back to Ib0cf5d55750f13d0499a570f14024dca551ed4d4
which was meant to address an issue introduced
by Id188d48609f3d22d14e16c7f6114291d547a8986.

So we essentially had three changes:

1. Hard reboot would blow away volumes and vifs and then wait for the
   vifs to be plugged; this caused a problem for some vif types (
   linuxbridge was reported) because the event never came and we
   timed out.

2. To workaround that, a second change was made to simply not wait for
   vif plugging events.

3. Since #2 was a bit heavy-handed for a problem that didn't impact
   openvswitch, another change was made to only wait for non-bridge vif
   types, so we'd wait for OVS.

But it turns out that opendaylight is an OVS vif type and doesn't send
events for plugging the vif, only for binding the port (and we don't
re-bind the port during reboot). There is also a report of this being a
problem for other types of ports, see
If209f77cff2de00f694b01b2507c633ec3882c82.

So rather than try to special-case every possible vif type that could
be impacted by this, we are simply reverting the change so we no longer
wait for vif plugged events during hard reboot.

Note that if we went back to Id188d48609f3d22d14e16c7f6114291d547a8986
and tweaked that to not unplug/plug the vifs we wouldn't have this
problem either, and that change was really meant to deal with an
encrypted volume issue on reboot. But changing that logic is out of the
scope of this change. Alternatively, we could re-bind the port during
reboot but that could have other implications, or neutron could put
something into the port details telling us which vifs will send events
and which won't, but again that's all outside of the scope of this
patch.

Each Ansible fork makes use of a session. By default, Ansible sets the number of forks to 5. However, you can increase the number of forks used in order to improve deployment performance in large environments. Note that more than 10 forks will cause issues for any playbooks which use ``delegate_to`` or ``local_action`` in the tasks. It is recommended that the number of forks are not raised when executing against the control plane, as this is where delegation is most often used. The number of forks used may be changed on a permanent basis by including the appropriate change to the ``ANSIBLE_FORKS`` in your ``.bashrc`` file. Alternatively it can be changed for a particular playbook execution by using the ``--forks`` CLI parameter. For example, the following executes the nova playbook against the control plane with 10 forks, then against the compute nodes with 50 forks. .. code-block:: shell-session # openstack-ansible --forks 10 os-nova-install.yml --limit compute_containers # openstack-ansible --forks 50 os-nova-install.yml --limit compute_hosts For more information about forks, please see the following references: * OpenStack-Ansible `Bug 1479812`_ * Ansible `forks`_ entry for ansible.cfg * `Ansible Performance Tuning`_ .. _Bug 1479812: https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1479812 .. _forks: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html#forks .. _Ansible Performance Tuning: https://www.ansible.com/blog/ansible-performance-tuning",,382,378

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

The in-band inspection is an asynchronous process isn't currently
handled through a ""waiting"" state. This is a discrepancy from the
rest of the asynchronous ironic states and may comprise a problem
for future features such as aborting the introspection or merging
ironic and ironic-inspector.

The spec adds a new inspect wait state to ironic state machine to
keep consistent with other asynchronous states.

The variable host_need_pip is currently used to be selective
about when pip is installed on the target hosts/containers.

This is an unnecessary precaution given that if the repo
container is not yet up, there is already a mechanism in place
to detect this and override the constraint and get-pip script
URL. By using this mechanism we get pip installed very early
and pip's configuration is still correctly constrained.

This patch ensures that this very same mechanism is used across
the board instead of using two different mechanisms, thereby
simplifying the approach.

The documentation has currently multiple problems:
- The top left tag of the openstacktheme isn't consistent with
  the latest available tag, which confuses people (see

- There are unused variables that could deserve cleanup
- There are static content that can be discovered from files
- We don't leverage the dynamic nature of the configuration for

  for some reason adding releasenotes.rst to exclude_patterns

interpolation

Since https://review.openstack.org/#/c/514707/ added the net_ip_map
to hieradata, we can look up the per-network bind IPs via hiera
interpolation instead of heat map_replace.

In some cases the ServiceNetMap lookup is used for other things,
but anywhere we make use of the ""magic"" translation via NetIpMap
is changed the same way.

This will enable more of the configuration data to be exposed per
role vs per node in a future patch (to simplify our ansible
workflow).

For Horizon installation please see http://docs.openstack.org/developer/horizon/quickstart.html 1. Clone Ironic UI repository: `git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/ironic-ui` 2. Change into the root directory of your horizon installation and run the venv. NOTE: this has been preinstalled when horizon was setup with ./run_tests.sh - do not reinstall venv `source .venv/bin/activate` 3. Copy the _2200_ironic.py file from ironic-ui/enabled directory to horizon/openstack_dashboard/local/enabled 4. Change into the ironic-ui repository and package the plugin: `pip install -e .` This will build and install the ironic-ui plugin into the active virtual environment associated with your horizon installation. The plugin is installed in ""editable"" mode as a link back to your ironic-ui plugin directory. Also ensure that all packages as per requirements.txt have been installed. 5. Change back into the horizon repository and bring up your environment: `./run_tests.sh --runserver` The Ironic Bare Metal Provisioning plugin should now be visible in the Horizon navigation. To uninstall, use pip uninstall (find the name of the package to uninstall by running pip list from inside the horizon .venv). You will also need to remove the enabled file from the openstack_dashboard/enabled folder.","At the command line:: $ pip install ironic-ui Or, if you have virtualenvwrapper installed:: $ mkvirtualenv ironic-ui $ pip install ironic-ui",110,29

This reverts commit fdee065bc8a2309965a51d9f24e624dfd088f9bd.

There has been a spike in volume test failures since this
change merged on March 13th due to scheduling failures in
Cinder with the CapacityFilter, presumably because the rename
caused too many volume tests to be running concurrently on
the same host.

Until we have a better solution, like potentially bumping
the size of the volume group in devstack, we can revert this
mostly cosmetic change to get the gate flowing again.

Given the UUID of a provider, set the inventory records for the provider

was created for the simpler get_inventory code path from the resource

This one is specially formulated for use by update_from_provider_tree,

Previously each region had its own entry for each service_type
with only it's own endpoints listed. This patch changes this
so that each service type has the endpoints from all regions
listed.

We also move the flawed templated get_v3_catalog function call
from the base catalog class into the templated class.

Added NEUTRON_DISTRIBUTED_ROUTING to more easily control DVR
configuration.  If set to True, DVR will be enabled and the
default agent mode will be set to 'dvr_snat' since that works
with all types of routers by default.  Advanced users can
override that by setting NEUTRON_DVR_MODE, for example in
multi-node configurations where different agent modes are
desired.

This should bring lib/neutron inline with lib/neutron-legacy
in supporting all the different DVR modes.

When building concatenated listings from shard ranges, tolerate shard
ranges that overlap and tolerate empty shard range listings.

Don't force the marker ahead to the next shard range lower (or upper
if reverse listing); if the next shard range has any misplaced objects
between the marker its lower bound (or upper bound if reverse listing)
then these will now be included in the listing.

Also continue to build a listing despite a shard container GET
response not succeeding.

Drive-by fix: do not apply client limit param when fetching shard
ranges.

Drive-by fix: for an unconstrained listing, set X-Container-Bytes-Used
equal to the sum of the object sizes in the returned listing, similar
to the object count as per [1].

In the prior change we added block-device-[mbr|gpt|efi] elements to
create appropriate disk-layouts.

This adds an environment flag to each so the bootloader can install
the right thing.  The EFI install path is updated to work with this
(this part a copy of I572937945adbb5adaa5cb09200752e323c2c9531)

We do some basic sanity checking in the block-device elements;
e.g. mbr is not suitable for aarch64, and efi is not suitable for
power.

This updates the bootloader to install EFI where appropriate

Since blueprint placement-claims in Pike, the Nova FilterScheduler
uses the placement service to make resource allocation 'claims'
before sending the build request to the chosen compute host to
perform the legacy style resource claim. This allows us to safely
scale out the number of scheduler workers when using the FilterScheduler.

The [scheduler]workers option defaults to ncpu if using the
FilterScheduler (which is the default scheduler driver) so to avoid
out of memory issues, we need to set $API_WORKERS scheduler workers
if using the FilterScheduler in devstack.

by the scheduler. That reduces the risk of scheduling collisions
when running multiple schedulers, so this change adds the ability
to set multiple scheduler workers like for the nova-osapi_compute
and nova-conductor services.
