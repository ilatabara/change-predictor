In the previous patch we changed the ordering of operations during
post_live_migration() to minimize guest networking downtime by
activating destination host port bindings as soon as possible.

Review of that patch led to the realization that exceptions during
notification sending can prevent the port binding activation from
happening. Instead of handling that in a localized try/catch, this
patch implements a general best_effort kwarg to our two notification
sending helpers to allow callers to indicate that any exceptions
during notification sending should not be fatal.

This patch add connection local for above mentioned task as
kolla-ansible can be executed in docker container as in
my case.

When there is no connection: local, ansible is trying to connect
to localhost via ssh where specified python script is not available.

After connection: local everything is working as expected as file
is found inside container

quorum queues

This implements a global toggle `om_enable_rabbitmq_quorum_queues`
to enable quorum queues for each service in RabbitMQ, similar to
what was done for HA[0].

Quorum Queues are not enabled by default in stable branches backports.

Quorum queues are more reliable, safer, simpler and faster than
replicated mirrored classic queues[1].

Mirrored classic queues are deprecated and scheduled for removal
in RabbitMQ 4.0[2].

Notice, that we do not need a new policy in the RabbitMQ definitions
template, because their usage is enabled on the client side and can't
be set using a policy[3].

Notice also, that quorum queues are not yet enabled in oslo.messaging
for the usage of reply_ and fanout_ queues (transient queues).
This will change once[4] is merged.

Some DB repository classes already raised NotFound on update of an
inexistent resources. Others just returned, but did not update anything.
This commit unifies the behavior by raising NotFound in all update
methods if no resource is found.

The missing check caused issues when two requests concurrently deleted
the same object. We encountered this for HealthMonitor resources, but
other resources are probably affected by the same issue.

1. The first request is received and the LB locked (=PENDING_UPDATE)
   and the HealthMonitor set to PENDING_DELETE. A 204 NO CONTENT
   response is sent to the client.

2. The second request is received while the health monitor still
   exists. Thus no immediate 404 NOT FOUND response is sent.

3. The health monitor deletion job finishes and the LB is unlocked
   (=ACTIVE).

4. The second request proceeds and is able to lock the LB
   (=PENDING_UPDATE). The health monitor repository update also
   succeeds, but does not update any object. A 204 NO CONTENT
   response is sent to the client.

5. The deletion job issued by the second request fails because the
   health monitor no longer exists in the database. Because this
   happens during setup of the deletion taskflow in the worker, no
   flow is started and the LB is stuck in the PENDING_UPDATE state.

With this change, the second health monitor DELETE request fails in step
4 and returns NotFound.

This also fixes a hidden bug in Amphora health record update where a
exception was expected which never occurred.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =========================================== Mediated device live migration with libvirt =========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-mdev-live-migrate Starting with libvirt-8.5.0, kvm-7.0.0 and Linux kernel 5.14.0, guests using mediated devices can be live migrated by using a target mediated device using the same mediated device type (and we don't need to unplug/plug the mdevs). Now, we need to support this for Nova, which means that Nova should provide a target mediated device UUID (that exists) to the source compute service by the pre-live-migrating call so the target XML created by the source would use it. Problem description =================== For the moment, this is not possible to live-migrate an instance if it uses a mediated device as the target wouldn't create it. You can only for the moment cold-migrate the instance or do other move operations like shelve. Fortunately, libvirt 8.5.0 now supports to live-migrate a guest by using a target mediated device uuid in the target XML so we want to directly support this in Nova. Use Cases --------- As an operator, I want to move my instance using a vGPU to another host without the user to know about it. As an operator, I don't want to rebuild my instance after live-migrating if the instance was previously using a vGPU. As an operator, I want to make sure I can't live-migrate my instance by using different mediated device types between the source and the target host. Proposed change =============== In order to succesfully live-migrate a guest with libvirt, you need to modify the target guest XML to use another mediated device using the same mdev (mediated device) type. In order to do it, we propose the following workflow : First, during the conductor compatibility checks, we will verify the types compatibility on the destination and we will claim for a specific list of target mediated devices (either to be created or just kept reserved) this way : - we will check the minimum service versions for all computes and raise an exception if old computes exist. See `Upgrade Impact`_ for more details. - ``check_can_live_migrate_destination()`` will return the list of the supported types in the ``LibvirtLiveMigrateData`` object. If also the libvirt version is below the minimum required (see `Dependencies`_), it will raise an exception. - ``check_can_live_migrate_source()`` will then check whether those mdev types are compatible with the current mediated devices of the instance and will raise a ``MigrationPreCheckError`` if not. If it's ok, it will then pass the list of number of mdevs with their types back in the ``LibvirtLiveMigrateData`` object. Like the destination, the driver will also check the libvirt version and fails if below the required version. - driver's ``post_claim_migrate_data()`` will pick N (N being the requested number) of the available mediated resources (either by creating new mdevs or taking existing ones), based on the list that was passed thru ``LibvirtLiveMigrateData``, and will persist that list of target mediated devices in some internal dictionary field of the ``LibvirtDriver`` instance, keyed by the instance UUID. Later, once the source host starts the live-migration, we will obtain the reserved mediated devices list from the destination host and we will update the guest XML information with those mediated device UUIDs this way : - in ``pre_live_migrate()`` (run on the destination node), we will get the mdev uuids list from the ``LibvirtDriver`` internal dictionary field that we did set in the previous step and we will persist that mdev uuids in the ``LibvirtLiveMigrateData`` object that we return over the wire to the source compute (we will call it later `migrate data object`). - in source's driver ``_live_migration_operation()`` we lookup the migrate data object we got and we update the target guest XML in ``get_updated_guest_xml()`` by getting those mediated device UUIDs from the migrate data object. - in destination's driver ``post_live_migration_at_destination()``, we delete the mdevs tracked in the internal dictionary field of the ``LibvirtDriver`` instance thanks to the migrate data object that was keeping the list of mediated devices claimed for the migration. In case of any live migration abort or exception, the residue we only need to clean up is basically the list of claimed mediated devices for the migration that are set in the dictionary field of the ``LibvirtDriver`` instance. Accordingly, we propose to delete those records this way : - if the exception occurred during pre-livemigration, it eventually calls on destination ``rollback_live_migration_at_destination()`` depending on ``_live_migration_cleanup_flags()`` result. We will modify that verification method to lookup whether we have mediated device UUIDs in the migrate data object. Then, ``rollback_live_migration_at_destination()`` will again look at the migrata data to know which mediated devices to remove from the internal dictionary in the ``LibvirtDriver``. - if the exception happened during the live-migration (or if the operator asked to abort it), then it eventually calls ``_rollback_live_migration()`` which also calls ``rollback_live_migration_at_destination()`` like above, so it would also remove the mdevsc from the ``LibvirtDriver`` dictionary field. As a side note, the `current method`__ we have for knowing which mediated devices are used by instances will be modified to also take in account the list of mediated devices that are currently set in internal directory field of the LibvirtDriver we'll be using for tracking which mdevs are claimed for migrations. .. __: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/b64ecb0cc776bd3eced674b0f879bb23c8a4b486/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L8361-L8394 Alternatives ------------ Operators could continue to only do cold migrations or we could try to unplug and then plug mediated devices during live-migration like we do at the moment for SR-IOV VFs. Data model impact ----------------- While we won't describe the internal dictionary we would use in the ``LibvirtDriver`` class instance as this is just an implementation question, we still need to explain which objects will be passed between computes RPC services. As we said earlier, we need to augment the ``LibvirtLiveMigrateData`` object. New fields will be added on that object (we can create a nested object if people prefer): * ``target_mdev_types: fields.ListOfStringsField()`` : list of mediated device types that the destination supports. * ``source_mdev_types: fields.DictOfStringsField()`` : dictionary where the key is a source mediated device UUID and the value is its mdev type. * ``target_mdevs: fields.ListOfUUIDField()`` : list of the destination mediated device UUIDs that will be used for live-migrating the instance. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- Operators wanting to use vGPU live-migration will need to support a recent libvirt release, so they probably need to upgrade their OS. They will also need to upgrade all their compute services, see `Upgrade Impact`_ for more details. Developer impact ---------------- None. Upgrade impact -------------- We don't want to let new computes trying to live migrate an instance to an older compute, right? So, we'll add a new compute service version and we'll add a check in the conductor compatibility check method called ``_check_can_migrate_specific_resources()`` for verifying if we have older computes. If so, we will return a ``MigrationPreCheckError`` exception. That said, given operators can use custom resource classes for virtual GPUs and not only the VGPU RC, we need to add a specific config option for the conductor which would tell which resource classes are used for mediated devices. By default, the value of this option would be only ``VGPU``. An example of this config option that would be in the ``[devices]`` group could be:: cfg.ListOpt( 'used_mdev_classes', default='VGPU', max_length=255, help="""""" List of the mediated device classes that are used by computes. Related options: * [devices]/mdev_class """""" ) Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: sylvain-bauza Other contributors: None Feature Liaison --------------- N/A Work Items ---------- * create the conductor config option * update the compute service version * add the ``LibvirtDriver`` internal dictionary * augment the ``LibvirtLiveMigrateData`` object * add the conductor checks * add the live-migration changes Dependencies ============ As said above, it requires : - libvirt-8.5.0 and newer - kvm-7.0.0 and newer - Linux kernel 5.14.0 and newer Testing ======= Unit and functional tests are a very bare minimum but we're actively chasing the idea to use the `mtty kernel samples framework`__ as a way to do some Tempest testing that's yet unwritten. We may need to build a custom kernel in order to get the latest version of mtty that includes live-migration support. .. __: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.8/driver-api/vfio-mediated-device.html#using-the-sample-code Documentation Impact ==================== We'll augment the usual `virtual GPU documentation`__ with a section on how to live-migrate and its requirements. .. __: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/virtual-gpu.html References ========== <libvirt docs to be inserted here if they exist> History ======= .. list-table:: Revisions :header-rows: 1 * - Release Name - Description * - 2024.1 Caracal - Introduced ",,289,0

the charm source. Instead, we have to use an Openstack release.
Since it was set to quincy, reset it to bobcat.

Because in the process of judging whether the image id is Duplicate,there is only deduplication without sorting, so no duplicate image error is judged as duplicate and an error ""Duplicate images in request"" is reported.

Now it is changed to sort after deduplication and then compare.

Two unit test cases were added to verify the fix

Previously, we first called to Cinder to cleanp source volume
connections, then to Neutron to activate destination port bindings.
This means that, if Cinder or the storage backend were slow, the live
migrated instance would be without network connectivity during that
entire process.

This patch immediately activates the port bindings on the destination
(and thus gives the instance network connectivity). We just need to
get the old network_info first, in order to use it in notifications
and to stash it for the later call to
driver.post_live_migration_at_source().

This is a smaller and safer change than the parallelization attempt in
the subsequent patch, so it's done in its own patch because it might
be backportable, and would help with network downtime during live
migration.

To avoid any potential data leaks, we want to be certain to cleanup
volumes on the source. To that end we wrap the code that is being
moved before the source volume cleanup code in a try/finally block
in order to prevent any uncaught exception from blocking the cleanup.

In the HA workflow, it will interact with Nova too much times. Every

This inital commit modernizes the code base to remove any python 2.7
syntax that is not reqiured in python3 such as the u prefix on strings
or declaring classes to inherit from object too have new style classes
i.e. ClassName(object)

Follow up patches will raise the moderisation to py36->py37->py38.

As part of our efforts to enhance automation and CI for Manila,
we have begun developing code in the Tobiko tool to support the
Manila client. During create/get operations, we have observed
that the returned body contains solely the resource id in the
format <Share: <id>>.
To address this, we are introducing a patch that allows retrieving
the full body response, not just the id resource.

This cherry-pick includes the change
I4c1c1e089a726608124693c13eca73ce12fd5b8e
(commit 2f6cd660c61ef22f96db65de94dd5f9212937f9d) from the
stable/2023.2 branch. Since both changes are closely related,
and resolve the same issue, we could squash the changes into
one submission for ease of back porting.

which was redefining the behavior of the standard library function
globally.

RBAC enforcement in manila happens in stages:
1) Does user have access to the API
2) Does user have access to the resource
3) Is user permitted to perform the API action on the resource

If (1) fails, user gets a HTTP 403, if (2) fails,
they get a HTTP 404; if (3) fails, they get a HTTP 403.

More often than not, (2) prevents ""existence"" detection
of resources that don't belong to the user; except in
case of ""public"" resources (e.g.: shares can be ""public"").

In some share API methods, policy checks for (1) are
happening after a bunch of processing. This leads to
some inconsistency.

Fix these occurrences to ensure a consistent user
experience.

This fixes a bug where keystone is deployed with more than one unit and
the leader is removed. With the current release the leader unit will set
{'db-initialised': None} and this causes the status of other units to
become ""Database not initialised"".

We need to also take into account the case where relation
departed/broken hooks are called following a ""juju remove-relation""
command, in which case we want to correctly set this value to None.

With this fix, during the shared-db-relation-departed/broken hook the
leader will set both 'db-initialised' to None and
'db-initalised-set-by-unit' to the unit id of the current leader. This
will allow the next leader unit to check on this value and revert if
necessary.

When the parent process used eventlet tpool to run code in native
threads then anything the child tries to run in a native thread will
hang forever.

The reason for that is that the parent has initialize the pool of
threads and use a flag to mark that it has been initialized, and when
the child is forked then it will have the flag saying that it has been
initialized and expects the threads to be running, but they are not.  So
there is no thread to pick up the job when a greenlet queues the job, so

The current fake driver does not properly clean up the fake RPC exchange
between tests.

This means that if a test invokes code that makes an RPC request, using
the fake driver, without consuming the RPC message, then another test
may receive this request making it fail.

This issues has been found while working on a Cinder patch and has been
worked-arounded there with Change-Id
I52ee4b345b0a4b262e330a9a89552cd216eafdbe.

This patch fixes the source of the problem by clearing the exchange
class dictionary in the FakeExchangeManager during the FakeDriver
cleanup.

While the first of these was a trivial fix, the second one is a little
more involved. It was caused by attempting to build a query across

What we actually want to do is lookup only the foreign keys that point

SELECT above: the 'security_group_instance_association' has two foreign
keys, one pointing to our 'instances' table but also another pointing to
the 'security_groups' table. We want the first but not the second.

Resolve this by checking if the table that each foreign key points to is
actually the source table and simply skip if not. With this issue
resolved, we can enable errors on SAWarning warnings in general without
any filters.

Libvirt's node device driver accumulates and reports information
about host devices. Network capabilities reported by node device
driver for NIC contain information about HW offloads supported
by this NIC.

One of possible features reported by node device driver is
switchdev: a NIC capability to implement VFs similar to actual
HW switch ports (also referred to as SR-IOV OVS hardware offload).
From Neutron perspective, vnic-type should be set to ""direct"" and
""switchdev"" capability should be added to port binding profile to
enable HW offload (there are also configuration steps on compute
hosts to tune NIC config).

This patch was written to automatically translate ""switchdev"" from
VF network capabilities reported by node device driver to Neutron
port binding profile and allow user to skip manual step that
requires admin privileges.

Other capabilities are also translated: they are not used right
now, but provide visibility and can be utilized later.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Ironic Shards ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/ironic-shards .. note:: The deprecation for the ``[ironic]\peer_list`` config option, explained below in `Config changes and Deprecations`_, was landed in 2023.2 (Bobcat). The rest of the feature was reverted due to a late-discovered bug and is being re-submitted in 2024.1 (Caracal). Problem description =================== Nova's Ironic driver involves a single nova-compute service managing many compute nodes, where each compute node record maps to an Ironic node. Some deployments support 1000s of ironic nodes, but a single nova-compute service is unable to manage 1000s of nodes and 1000s of instances. Currently we support setting a partition key, where nova-compute only cares about a subset of ironic nodes, those associated with a specific conductor group. However, some conductor groups can be very large, servered by many ironic-conductor services. To help with this, Nova has attempted to dynamically spread ironic nodes between a set of nova-compute peers. While this work some of the time, there are some major limitations: * when one nova-compute is down, only unassigned ironic nodes can move to another nova-compute service * i.e. when one nova-compute is down, all ironic nodes with nova instances associated with the down nova-compute service are unable to be managed, i.e. reboot will fail * moreover, when the old nova-compute comes back up, which might take some time, there are lots of bugs as the hash ring slowly rebalances. In part because every nova-compute fetches all nodes, in a large enough cloud, this can take over 24 hours. This spec is about tweaking the way we shard Ironic compute nodes. We need to stop violating deep assumptions in the compute manager code by moving to a more static ironic node partitions. Use Cases --------- Any users of the ironic driver that have more than one nova-compute service per conductor group should move to an active-passive failover mode. The new static sharding will be of paritcular interest for clouds with ironic conductor groups that are greater than around 1000 baremetal nodes. .. NOTE: many parts of this story work today but need better documentation: * understanding the current scale limit of around 500-1000 ironic nodes per nova-compute, and the best way to scale beyond that * sharding ironic-conductors and nova-computes using ironic conductor groups. Note: conductor groups have a specific use in Ironic and this is not it, but it works for some users. * active-passive failover for nova-compute services running the ironic driver. Note: the time to start up a new process after a failover is way too high, particularly at larger scales without conductor groups. Proposed change =============== We add a new configuration option: * [ironic] shard_key By default, there will be no shard_key set, and we will continue to expose all ironic nodes from a single nova-compute process. Mostly, this is to keep things simple for smaller deployments, i.e. when you have less than 500 ironic nodes. When the operator sets a shard_key, the compute-node process will use the shard_key when querying a list of nodes in Ironic. We must never try to list all Ironic nodes when the Ironic shard key is defined in the config. When we look up a specific ironic node via a node uuid or instance uuid, we should not restrict that to either the shard key or conductor group. Similar to checking the instance uuid is still present on the Ironic node before performing an action, or ensuring there is no instance uuid before provisioning, we should also check the node is in the correct shard (and conductor group) before doing anything with that Ironic node. Config changes and Deprecations ------------------------------- We will keep the option to target a specific conductor group, but this option will be renamed from partition_key to conductor_group. This is addative to the shard_key above, the target ironic nodes are those in both the correct `shard_key` and the correct `conductor_group`, when both are configured. We will deprecate the use of the `peer_list`. We should log a warning when the hash ring is being used, i.e. when it has more than one member added to the hash ring. In addtion, we need the logic that tries to move Compute Nodes to never work unless the peer_list is larger than one. More details in the data model impact section. When deleting a ComputeNode object, we need to have the driver confirm that is safe. In the case of Ironic we will check to see if the configured Ironic has a node with that uuid, searching across all conductor groups and all shard keys. When the ComputeNode object is not deleted, we should not delete the entry in placement. nova-manage move ironic node ---------------------------- We will create a new nova-manage command:: nova-manage ironic-compute-node-move <ironic-node-uuid> \ --service <destination-service> This command will do the following: * Find the ComputeNode object for this ironic-node-uuid * Error if the ComputeNode type does not match the ironic driver. * Find the related Service object for the above ComputeNode (i.e. the host) * Error if the service object is not reported as down, and has not also been put into maintanance. We do not require forced down, because we might only be moving a subset of nodes associated with this nova-compute service. * Check the Service object for the destination service host exists * Find all non-deleted instances for this (host,node) * Error if there is more than 1 non-deleted instance found. It is OK if we find zero or 1 instances. * In one DB transaction: move the ComputeNode object to the destination service host and move the Instance (if there is one) to the destination service host The above tool is expected to be used as part of this wider process of migrating from the old peer_list to the new shard key. There are two key scearios (although the tool may help operator recover from other issues as well): * moving from a peer_list to a single nova-compute * moving from peer_list to shard_key, while keeping multiple nova-compute proccesses (for a single conductor group) Migrate from peer_list to single nova-compute --------------------------------------------- Small deployments (i.e. less than 500 ironic nodes) are recommended to move from a peer_list of, for example, three nova-compute services, to a single nova-compute service. On failure of the nova-compute service, operators can either manually start the processes on a new host, or use an automatic active-passive HA scheme. The process would look something like this: * ironic and nova both default to an empty_shard key by default, such that all ironic nodes are in the same default shard * start a new nova-compute service running the ironic driver, ideally with a syntheic value for `[DEFAULT]host` e.g. `ironic` This will log warnings about the need to use the nova-compute migration tool before being able to manage any nodes * stop all existing nova-compute services * mark them as forced-down via the API * Now loop around all ironic nodes and call this, assuming your nova-compute service has its host value of just `ironic`: `nova_manage ironic-compute-node-move <uuid> --service ironic` The periodic tasks in the new nova-compute service will gradually pick up the new ComputeNodes, and will start being able to recieve commands such a reboot for all the moved instances. While you could start the new nova-compute service after having migrated all the ironic compute nodes, but that would lead to higher downtime during the migration. Migrate from peer_list to shard_key ----------------------------------- The proccess to move from the hash key based peer_list to the static shard_key from ironic is very similar to the above process: * Set the shard_key on all your ironic nodes, such that you can spread the nodes out between your nova-compute processes, * Start your new nova compute processes, one for each `shard_key`, possibly setting a synthetic `[DEFAULT]host` value that matches the `my_shard_key`. * Shutdown all the older nova-compute processs with `[ironic]peer_list` set * Mark those older services as in maintainance via the Nova API * For each shard_key in Ironic, work out which service host you have mapped each one to above, then run this for each ironic node uuid in the shard: `nova_manage ironic-compute-node-move <uuid> --service my_shard_key` * Delete the old services via the Nova API, now there are no instances or compute nodes on those services While you could start the new nova-compute services after the migration, that would lead to a slightly longer downtime. Adding new compute nodes ------------------------ In general, there is no change when adding nodes into existing shards. Similarly, you can add a new nova-compute process for a new shard and then start to fill that up with nodes. Move an ironic node between shards ---------------------------------- When removing nodes from ironic at the end of their life, or adding large numbers of new nodes, you may need to rebalance the shards. To move some ironic nodes, you need to move the nodes in groups associated with a specific nova-compute process. For each nova-compute and the associated ironic nodes you want to move to a different shard you need to: * Shutdown the affected nova-compute process * Put nova-compute services into in maintanance * In Ironic API update the shard key on the Ironic node * Now move each ironic node to the correct new nova-compute process for the shard key it was moved into: `nova_manage ironic-compute-node-move <uuid> --service my_shard_key` * Now unset maintanance mode for the nova-compute, and start that service back up Move shards between nova-compute services ----------------------------------------- To move a shard between nova-compute services, you need to replace the nova-compute process with a new one: * ensure the destination nova-compute is configured with the shard you want to move, and is running * stop the nova-compute process currently serving the shard * force-down the service via the API * for each ironic node uuid in the shard call nova-manage to move it to the new nova-compute process Alternatives ------------ We could require nova-compute processes to be explicitly forced down, before allowing the nova-manage to move the ironic nodes about, in a similar way to evacuate. But this creates problems when trying to re-balance shards as you remove nodes at the end of their life. We could consider a list of shard keys, rather than a single shard key per nova-compute. But for this first version, we have chosen the simpler path, that appears to have few limitations. We could attempt to keep fixing the hash ring recovery within the ironic driver, but its very unclear what will break next due to all the deep assumptions made about the nova-compute process. The specific assumptions include: * when nova-compute breaks, its usually the hypervisor hardware that has broken, which includes all the nova servers running on that. * all locking and management of a nova server object is done by the currently assigned nova-compute node, and this is only ever changed by explict move operations like resize, migrate, live-migration and evacuate. As such we can use simple local locks to ensure concurrent operations don't conflict, along with DB state checking. Data model impact ----------------- A key thing we need to ensure is that ComputeNode objects are only automatically moved between service objects when in legacy hash ring mode. Currently, this only happens for unassigned ComputeNodes. In this new explicit shard mode, only nova-manage is able to move ComputeNode objects. In addtion, nova-manage will also move associated instances. However, similar to evacuate, this will only be allowed when the currently associated service is forced down. Note, this applies when a nova-compute finds a ComputeNode that is should own, but the Nova database says its already owned by a difference service. In this scenario, we should log a warning to the operator to ensure they have migrated that ComputeNode from its old location before this nova-compute service is able to manage it. In addition, we should ensure we only delete a ComputeNode object when the driver explictly says its safe to delete. In the case of the Ironic driver, we should ensure the node no longer exists in Ironic, being sure to search across all shards. This is all very related this spec on robustfying the Compute Node and Service object relationship: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/nova-specs/+/853837 REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- Users will experience a more reliable Ironic and Nova integration. Performance Impact ------------------ It should help users more easily support large ironic deployments integrated with Nova. Other deployer impact --------------------- We will rename the ""partition_key"" configuration to be expliclity ""conductor_group"". We will deprecate the peer list key. When we start up and see anything set, we ommit a warning about the bugs in using this legacy auto sharding, and recomend moving to the explicit sharding. There is a new `shard_key` config, as descirbed above. There is a new nova_manage CLI command to move Ironic compute nodes on forced-down nova-compute services to a new one. Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- For those currenly using peer_list, we need to document how they can move to the new sharding approach. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: JayF Other contributors: johnthetubaguy Feature Liaison --------------- Feature liaison: None Work Items ---------- * rename conductor group partition key config * deprecate peer_list config, with warning log messages * add compute node move and delete protections, when peer_list not used * add new shard_key config, limit ironic node list using shard_key * add nova-manage tool to move ironic nodes between compute services * document operational processes around above nova-manage tool * tempest testing to ensure shard boundries are respected Dependencies ============ The deprecation of the peer list can happen right away. But the new sharding depends on the Ironic shard key getting added: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/ironic-specs/+/861803 Ideally we add this into Nova after robustify compute node has landed: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/nova/+/842478 Testing ======= We need some functional tests for the nova-manage command to ensure all of the safty guards work as expected. Documentation Impact ==================== A lot of docs needed for the Ironic driver on the operational procedures around the shard_key.

In this case, green threads_ are used, which allows for a smaller memory footprint at the expense of only using one CPU core... _worker-threads: Threads ------- The conductor uses green threads based on Eventlet_ project to allow a very high concurrency while keeping the memory footprint low. When a request comes from the API to the conductor over the RPC, the conductor verifies it, acquires a node-level lock (if needed) and launches a processing thread for further handling. The maximum number of such threads is limited to the value of :oslo.config:option:`conductor.workers_pool_size` configuration option. .. note:: Some workers are always or regularly occupied by internal processes, e.g. :doc:`/admin/power-sync`. Once the limit is reached, any new requests will be denied with HTTP code 503 (service unavailable). The clients are expected to be able to handle this code, most likely by retrying after a short delay or by throttling their requests. If you see a large number of this errors, you may try raising the limit gradually, while observing the conductor behavior and making sure the requests don't start to take longer because of switching between threads. A better alternative is to increase the number of conductors because it will also allow using more than one CPU core. .. note:: Running more than one conductor on the same machine is a somewhat uncharted territory. You need to make sure they either have separate HTTP servers or share the same HTTP server without conflicting. If you use JSON RPC, you also need to make sure the ports don't conflict by setting the :oslo.config:option:`json_rpc.port` option. .. _eventlet: https://eventlet.net/ ",,38,0

The commit 484b7d8260 introduced a new relation that relies on an
application databag to exchange data, although only the leader can write
to it, and the original patch didn't guard the relation_set() call with
a is_leader(), this patch addresses that problem wich produces a hook

Because in the process of judging whether the image id is Duplicate,there is only deduplication without sorting, so no duplicate image error is judged as duplicate and an error ""Duplicate images in request"" is reported.

Now it is changed to sort after deduplication and then compare.

Two unit test cases were added to verify the fix

The loadbalancer property of Octavia::Listener resource has been
optional but this is not aligned with Octavia's API and causes
a strange failure when a user creates a pool without the property.

This makes the property required to enforce the same requirements as
one made by Octavia's API.

The library syntx job and the library lint job inherit the integration

change replaces their parent template to reduce the repository

Also, the library unit job base is very similar to the normal unit test

This adds a boolean variable which can be used to make devstack
configure a separate Ceph pool per backend in CINDER_ENABLED_BACKENDS.
It can be useful for testing volume migrations across Ceph pools and it
defaults to False.

For example:

CINDER_ENABLED_BACKENDS=ceph:ceph1,ceph:ceph2
CINDER_CEPH_POOL_PER_BACKEND=True

will make a cinder.conf with:

[ceph1]
rbd_pool = ceph1_volumes

Prior to this patch, ML2/OVS and ML2/OVN had inconsistent IGMP
configurations. Neutron only exposed one configuration option for IGMP:
igmp_snooping_enabled.

Other features such as IGMP flood, IGMP flood reports and IGMP flood
unregistered were hardcoded differently on each driver (see LP#2044272
for a more details).

These hardcoded values has led to many changes over the years tweaking
them to work on different scenarios but they were never final because
the fix for one case would break the other.

This patch introduces 3 new configuration options for these other IGMP
features that can be enabled or disabled on both backends. Operators
can now fine tune their deployments in the way that will work for them.

As a consequence of the hardcoded values for each driver we had to break
some defaults and, in the case of ML2/OVS, if operators want to keep
things as they were before this patch they will need to enable the new
mcast_flood and mcast_flood_unregistered configuration options.

That said, the for ML2/OVS there was also an inconsistency with the help
string of igmp_snooping_enabled configuration option as it mentioned
that enabling snooping would disable flooding to unregistered ports but
that was not true anymore after the fix [0].

Some changes require updating the existing entities in a
clear and transparent way for the user.

This patch adds a mechanism to create separate tasks that
can run periodically or just once in order to update or
modify existing entities that require changes after a new
patch or RFE.

As an example, a first task has been included for updating
existing OVN LB HM ports, changing their device_owner, and
adding their device_id.

This patch adds support for using domain_id, user_domain_id, and
project_domain_id to authenticate the client. The motivations of
this patch are:
1. aligning tempest authentication variables with the ones stated
in the official documentation
2. supporting test domain isolation. Domain id can be used in
`/v3/domains/{domain_id}` API to get a domain object without the
need of listing all domains (`/v3/domains/name={domain_name}`).
This can be useful whenever the two APIs are configured to
require different privilege levels.

Since the get_backup_device RPC was made asynchronous in RPC version
3.17 (Yoga), concurrent backups are no longer limited because the
@limit_operations decorator is applied to the initial create_backup RPC,
but not the continue_backup RPC that actually does the work.

This change fixes the issue by adding the @limit_operations decorator to
the continue_backup RPC as well.

moving SGs

There's a potential deadlock scenario in PowerMax's masking.py
""do_move_volume_between_storage_groups"" method.

The method uses 2 locks, one for the source Storage Group and another
for the destination Storage Group, and it could happen that if 2
requests going in opposite directions are received simultaneously their
first lock acquisition interleaves resulting in a deadlock situation.

    @coordination.synchronized(
        ""emc-sg-{source_storagegroup_name}-{serial_number}"")
    @coordination.synchronized(
        ""emc-sg-{target_storagegroup_name}-{serial_number}"")
    def do_move_volume_between_storage_groups(
        serial_number, source_storage_group_name,
        target_storage_group_name):

The scenario would be like this:

- User requests an instance migration from A to B
- User requests an instance migration from B to A
- Driver acquires the first lock for A-to-B for example something like
  cinder-emc-sg-SGA-###
- Driver acquires the first lock for B-to-A for example something like
  cinder-emc-sgSGB-###

The deadlock happens because A-to-B waits forever for the lock held by
the B-to-A operation, which in turn cannot proceed because it’s waiting
for lock held by A-to-B.

This patch fixes it using the new coordination.synchronized
functionality that ensures that a series of locks are always acquired in
the same order, preventing deadlocks.

Scheduling and database information ----------------------------------- Ports of the type ``external`` will be scheduled on nodes marked to host these type of ports via the `ovn-cms-options <http://www.ovn.org/support/dist-docs/ovn-controller.8.html>`_ configuration. There are two supported configurations for these nodes: 1. ``enable-chassis-as-extport-host`` 2. ``enable-chassis-as-gw`` These options can be set by running the following command locally on each node that will act as a candidate to host these ports: .. code-block:: bash $ ovs-vsctl set Open_vSwitch . external-ids:ovn-cms-options=\""enable-chassis-as-extport-host\"" $ ovs-vsctl set Open_vSwitch . external-ids:ovn-cms-options=\""enable-chassis-as-gw\"" .. end The sections below will explain the differences between the two configuration values. Configuration: ``enable-chassis-as-extport-host`` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ When nodes in the cluster are marked with the ``enable-chassis-as-extport-host`` configuration, the ML2/OVN driver will schedule the external ports onto these nodes. This configuration takes precedence over ``enable-chassis-as-gw``. With this configuration, the ML2/OVN driver will create one ``HA_Chassis_Group`` per external port and it will be named as ``neutron-extport-<Neutron Port UUID>``. For example: .. code-block:: bash $ ovn-sbctl list Chassis _uuid : fa24d475-9664-4a62-bb1c-52a6fa4966f7 external_ids : {ovn-cms-options=enable-chassis-as-extport-host, ...} hostname : compute-0 name : ""6fd9cef6-4e9d-4bde-ab82-016c2461957b"" ... _uuid : a29ee8f6-5301-45f5-b280-a43e533d4d65 external_ids : {ovn-cms-options=enable-chassis-as-extport-host, ...} hostname : compute-1 name : ""4fa76c10-c6ea-4ae9-b31c-bc69103fe6f9"" ... .. end .. code-block:: bash $ ovn-nbctl list HA_Chassis_Group neutron-extport-392a77f9-7c48-4ad0-bd06-8b55bba00bd1 _uuid : 1249b761-24e3-414e-ae10-7e880e9d3cf8 external_ids : {""neutron:availability_zone_hints""=""""} ha_chassis : [0d6b9718-7718-45d2-a838-1deb40131442, ae6e64e7-f948-49b3-a171-c9cfb58c8b31] name : neutron-extport-392a77f9-7c48-4ad0-bd06-8b55bba00bd1 .. end Also, for HA, there will be a limit of five Chassis per ``HA_Chassis_Group``, meaning that even if there are more nodes marked with the ``enable-chassis-as-extport-host`` option, each group will contain up to five members. This limit has been imposed because OVN uses BFD to monitor the connectivity of each member in the group, and having an unlimited number of members can potentially put a lot of stress on OVN. In general, this option is used when there are specific requirements for ``external`` ports and they can not be scheduled on controllers or gateway nodes. The next configuration does the opposite and uses the nodes marked as gateway to schedule the ``external`` ports. Configuration: ``enable-chassis-as-gw`` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ For the majority of use cases where there are no special requirements for the ``external`` ports and they can be co-located with gateway ports, this configuration should be used. Gateway nodes are identified by the ``enable-chassis-as-gw`` and `ovn-bridge-mappings <http://www.ovn.org/support/dist-docs/ovn-controller.8.html>`_ configurations:type ``external`` in the OVN Northbound database. When the ``enable-chassis-as-gw`` configuration is used, the ML2/OVN driver will create one ``HA_Chassis_Group`` per network (instead of one per external port in the previous case) and it will be named as ``neutron-<Neutron Network UUID>``. All ``external`` ports belonging to this network will share the same ``HA_Chassis_Group`` and the group is also limited to a maximum of five members for HA. $ ovn-nbctl list HA_Chassis_Group external_ids : {""neutron:availability_zone_hints""=""""}High availability ----------------- As hinted above, the ML2/OVN driver does provide high availability to the ``external`` ports. This is done via the ``HA_Chassis_Group`` mechanism from OVN. On every ``external`` port there will be a column called ``ha_chassis_group`` which points to the ``HA_Chassis_Group`` that the port belongs to: $ ovn-nbctl find logical_switch_port type=external ha_chassis_group : 924fd0fe-3e84-4eaa-aa1d-41103ec511e5 name : ""287040d6-0936-4363-ae0a-2d5a239e55fa"" type : external ... .. end In the ``HA_Chassis_Group``, the members of each group are listed in the ``ha_chassis`` column: .. code-block:: bash $ ovn-nbctl list HA_Chassis_Group 924fd0fe-3e84-4eaa-aa1d-41103ec511e5 _uuid : 924fd0fe-3e84-4eaa-aa1d-41103ec511e5 external_ids : {""neutron:availability_zone_hints""=""""} ha_chassis : [3005bf84-fc95-4361-866d-bfa1c980adc8, 72c7671e-dd48-4100-9741-c47221672961] name : neutron-extport-287040d6-0936-4363-ae0a-2d5a239e55fa .. end .. note:: There will be a maximum of five members for each group, this limit has been imposed because OVN uses BFD to monitor the connectivity of each member in the group, and having an unlimited number of members can potentially put a lot of stress on OVN. .. end When listing the members of a group there will be a column called ``priority`` that contains a numerical value, the member with the highest ``priority`` is the chassis where the ports will be scheduled on. OVN will monitor each member via BFD protocol, and if the chassis that is hosting the ports goes down, the ports will be automatically scheduled on the next chassis with the highest priority that is alive. .. code-block:: bash In the example above, the Chassis with the UUID ``1a462946-ccfd-46a6-8abf-9dca9eb558fb`` is the one that is hosting the external port ``287040d6-0936-4363-ae0a-2d5a239e55fa``.","~~~~~~~~~~Also, ports of the type ``external`` will be scheduled on the gateway nodes (controller or networker nodes) in HA mode by the OVN Neutron driver. Check the `OVN Database information`_ section for more information. OVN Database information ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ the ML2/OVN driver identifies a gateway node by the ``ovn-cms-options=enable-chassis-as-gw`` and ``ovn-bridge-mappings`` options in the external_ids column from the ``Chassis`` table in the OVN Southbound database:For more information about both of these options, please take a look at the `ovn-controller documentation <http://www.ovn.org/support/dist-docs/ovn-controller.8.html>`_. These options can be set by running the following command locally on each gateway node (note, the ``ovn-bridge-mappings`` will need to be adapted to your environment): .. code-block:: bash $ ovs-vsctl set Open_vSwitch . external-ids:ovn-cms-options=\""enable-chassis-as-gw\"" external-ids:ovn-bridge-mappings=\""public:br-ex\"" .. end type ``external`` in the OVN Northbound database. These ports can be found by issuing the following command: $ ovn-nbctl find Logical_Switch_Port type=external _uuid : 105e83ae-252d-401b-a1a7-8d28ec28a359 ha_chassis_group : [43047e7b-4c78-4984-9788-6263fcc69885] type : external ... .. end The ``ha_chassis_group`` column indicates which HA Chassis Group that port belongs to, to find that group do: .. code-block:: bash # The UUID is the one from the ha_chassis_group column from # the Logical_Switch_Port table $ ovn-nbctl list HA_Chassis_Group 43047e7b-4c78-4984-9788-6263fcc69885 external_ids : {}.. note:: The external ports will be placed on a HA Chassis Group for the network that the port belongs to. Those HA Chassis Groups are named as ``neutron-<Neutron Network UUID>``, as seeing in the output above. You can also use this ""name"" with the ``ovn-nbctl list`` command when searching for a specific HA Chassis Group. The chassis that are members of the HA Chassis Group are listed in the ``ha_chassis`` column. Those are the gateway nodes (controller or networker nodes) in the deployment and it's where the ``external`` ports will be scheduled. In order to find which gateway node the external ports are scheduled on use the following command: # The UUIDs are the UUID members of the HA Chassis Group # (ha_chassis column from the HA_Chassis_Group table)Note the ``priority`` column from the previous command, the chassis with the highest ``priority`` from that list is the chassis that will have the external ports scheduled on it. In our example above, the chassis with the UUID ``1a462946-ccfd-46a6-8abf-9dca9eb558fb`` is the one. Whenever the chassis with the highest priority goes down, the ports will be automatically scheduled on the next chassis with the highest priority which is alive. So, the external ports are HA out of the box.",163,65

This patch introduces a new configuration for OVN CMS Options called
""enable-chassis-as-extport-host"". This configuration can be used
by ML2/OVN to identify nodes that are eligible for scheduling OVN's
external ports.

Prior to this patch, external ports were always scheduled on centralized
networked nodes tagged with the ""enable-chassis-as-gw"" flag in the OVN
CMS Options but, when it comes to deploying OpenStack on OpenShift
requiring services such as the OVN Metadata Agent or DHCP Agent to
serve those external ports and running them on control plane nodes are
not ideal. This is where this patch comes handy allowing these ports to
have more flexibility in where they are scheduled.

The patch is also backward compatible and if the new configuration is
not present on the OVN CMS Options, ML2/OVN will continue to schedule
the external ports on nodes configured with the previous configuration
like always.

Documentation will be updated on a follow up patch.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================================================================= Configurable Security Group rules added by default to the new Security Groups ============================================================================= https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1983053 Problem Description =================== For every project, Neutron always creates security group called ``default``. It is created always when first time security groups are going to be used or requested to be listed via API. For each of such ``default`` security group Neutron automatically creates 4 hardcoded rules. Those rules allows: * all ``IPv4`` egress traffic from the port, * all ``IPv6`` egress traffic from the port, * all ``IPv4`` ingress traffic to the port incoming from other ports which are using the same security group, * all ``IPv6`` ingress traffic to the port incoming from other ports which are using the same security group. For any other security group created by user, Neutron automatically creates 2 rules which allows: * all ``IPv4`` egress traffic from the port, * all ``IPv6`` egress traffic from the port, There is at least couple of issues with such approach: * it is known fact that SG rules with remote_group_id (rule 3. and 4. above) don't scale well e.g. with neutron-openvswitch-agent [1]_, * some operators would like to define different rules to be created by default for each new project. Of course, those rules created by default by Neutron can be easy removed by the security group owner, but having possibility to define different set of rules added automatically to each security group could make it easier for users and administrators of the cloud. Proposed Change =============== To solve the problem described above, proposal is to introduce new API to create ``security group rules template`` used to create new security group rules for each new security group. To keep backward compatybility with the existing hardoded rules, by default Neutron will have configured the same 4 rules as are hardcoded today (see above for defails). Cloud admin will be able to delete those rules and create new ones which will be then used by Neutron for every new security group.

This change comes after compute-agent could not
connect to libvirt service.

This is a reaction to an observed situation,
where nova restarted its containers and deleted
and recreated the /run/libvirt folder.

Or, the compute agent is unable to connect to libvirt
service after it was recovered and brought to healthy
status.

This caused the ceilometer container to not be able
to read the libvirt socket and thus no metrics could
be captured.

With this change, connection to libvirt is refreshed
if found not alive.

Default value of Restart for any service which type is not `oneshot` is
`on-failure`. While this suits most usecases, this leads to unexpected
consequences for cinder-purge-deleted.service.

In case there're some historical inconsistencies in the database which
make impossible to flush deleted volumes from the database
(ie due to prior manual intervention), cinder-manage exists with code 1
which triggers systemd to restart the service and attempt cleanup again.

The troublesome part is the transactional behaviour of the script. With
each run it locks records in it's transaction that is failing and being
reverted in a loops with 2 sec delay, that not only causes unnecessary
load for database itself, but also causes deadlocks during operations
with volumes that are not being re-tryed and fail with 500 return code
in cinder-api.

Changing Restart to `on-abnormal` will leave service in a failed state
and systemd won't attempt to restart it.

Current logic was relying on iteration inside the template. However,
since config_template module was used to deliver network configuration
it was merging sections having same name together.

While this behaviour is correct one for config_template as all sections
must be unique from ConfigParser perspective and in order to apply
overrides properly, it was not suiting the way how routes should be
defined in networkd configuration.

To workaround the issue we place routes separately under <network>.d
directory, which should be supported by systemd [1]

Right now we define resulting filename in the loop itself, which limits
ability to predict expected filename for another loop where list might
get filtered.

So to get more expected behaviour between tasks we always add filename
to the elements in vars.

This patch adds support for IPv6 metadata service in ML2/OVN.
The changes include:

- Add the 'fe80::a9fe:a9fe/128' address to the interface of the
  ovnmeta- namespace so that it's reachable from the guests

- Identify the port of the VM by looking up the source MAC address
  of the metadata request

- Restarts the haproxy instances to honor the configuration changes
  upon start of the metadata agent. In particular, haproxy now also
  binds on the 'fe80::a9fe:a9fe' address

When the VM requests metadata from its LLA, the traffic will reach
the ovnmeta namespace associated to its network.

The IPv6 metadata tests are passing and enabled in Tempest by
this patch:
https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/neutron-tempest-plugin/+/894027

Besides, this patch ensures that the link-local address of the
metadata interface is present so that the metadata IPv6 endpoint
is reachable. It also fixes a bug that was causing the wrong LLA
to be present as the interface was set `up` first prior to changing
the MAC address. Now this order is inverted so that the proper LLA
is configured.

If a method is not allowed, real swift proxy server app will return an
HTTPMethodNotAllowed response, whereas FakeSwift would previously
*raise* HTTPNotImplemented. S3Api deliberately sends requests with
method 'TEST' which is not allowed/implemented. To workaround the
difference in real and fake swift behaviour, FakeSwift was configured
to allow the 'TEST' method, and then in some tests an
HTTPMethodNotAllowed response was registered for 'TEST' requests!

This patch modifies FakeSwift to return an HTTPMethodNotAllowed
response to the incoming request when the request method is not
allowed.

It is no longer necessary for FakeSwift to support extending the
default list of allowed methods.

If not using --limit, each host runs the setup module for itself only.
Hosts should be able to fail at this point and drop out of execution
without affecting others. However, there is a bug that causes us to hit
the --limit code path for an unreachable host and therefore become
subject to its limitations.  These include the use of delegated fact
gathering, and failing the delegated host when the delegating host is
unreachable.

This change fixes the issue by reversing the order of two tasks in the
gather-facts.yml playbook, ensuring that we check the ansible_play_batch
variable before any hosts have had a chance to fail.

The commit 484b7d8260 introduced a new relation that relies on an
application databag to exchange data, although only the leader can write
to it, and the original patch didn't guard the relation_set() call with
a is_leader(), this patch addresses that problem wich produces a hook
failure on follower units when openstack-dashboard is deployed in HA.

Extend the get_hosts_mapped_with_segments method to add
optional filters to include/exclude based on agent type.
Uses a joined query, when both include and exclude
filtering is used togheter the exclude filter is most
significant.

When using simple-init, we are making an explicit choice
along the lines of ""I want the simple tool to do the simple needful""
which works well, except when cloud-init tries to run because it
is already baked into the source image diskimage-builder started
with.

So what would happen is Glean would execute from simple-init,
and then cloud-init would get launched by default, and cloud-init
in some cases everything is DHCP, so suddenly any static
configuration, such as what might be in an attached configuration
drive, is stomped upon resulting in an unreachable instance if
DHCP is just not available.

If DHCP is available, generally this is not an issue and goes
un-noticed, yet can add a substantial amount of time to the
boot sequence ""waiting"" for meta-data endpoints which may
not exist.

This patch allows delete_volume and delete_snapshot calls
to fail less often when using RBD volume clones and snapshots.

RBD clone v2 support allows remove() to pass in situations
where it would previously fail, but it still fails with an
ImageBusy error in some situations.  For example:

 volume1
   -> snapshot s1 of volume 1
     -> volume2 cloned from snapshot 1
Deleting snapshot s1 would fail with ImageBusy.

This is fixed by using RBD flatten operations to break
dependencies between volumes/snapshots and other RBD volumes
or snapshots.

Delete now works as follows:
  1. Attempt RBD remove()
     This is the ""fast path"" for removing a simple volume
     that involves no extra overhead.
  2. If busy and the volume has child dependencies,
     flatten those dependencies with RBD flatten()
  3. Attempt RBD remove() again
     This will succeed in more cases than (1) would have.
  4. If remove() failed, use trash_move() instead to move
     the image to the trash instead.
     This allows Cinder deletion of a volume (volume1) to proceed
     in the scenario where volume2 was cloned from snapshot s1 of
     volume1, and snapshot s1 has been trashed and not fully
     deleted from the RBD backend.  (Snapshots in the trash
     namespace are no longer visible but are still in the
     dependency chain.)

This allows Cinder deletions to succeed in most scenarios where
they would previously fail.

In cases where a .clone_snap snapshot is present, we still do a
rename to .deleted instead of deleting/trashing the volume.  This
should be worked on further in a follow-up as it is likely not
necessary most of the time.

A new configuration option, rbd_concurrent_flatten_operations, was
introduced to limit how many flatten calls can be made at the same time.
This is to prevent overloading the backend. The default value is 3.
