This changeset tracks the changes needed by the Embrane's Neutron Plugin
in order to consistently  pass tempest tests.

Changes:

- Some db transactions were too long and were causing lock timeout
exception. Removed useless transactions (waiting on non-db tasks to complete)
to fix the problem.

- The operation filter was useless, and breaking the tests. Most of the
logic which guarantees the appliance correct state when an operation in executed
is now in the internal library used for the heleos APIs.
The filter was therefore removed (as well as the corresponding exception).

- Fixed ""sync"" mode. The behavior was incorrect due to the queue timeout.
Furthermore, parallel requests were not waiting on the correct thread.

- Added missing methods for floating IPs (not all the scenarios were covered).

- Minor bug fixes caught during the tests.

x-openstack-request-id is the common header name for request ID going forward.
Currently, only glance and neutron return this header. Using the request_id
middleware is a convenient way to ensure this header is in the response. We will
also be using the middleware to generate the request ID.

The ID will be generated by the middleware and is inserted into the request
environment. The current code generates the request ID in the constructor of
RequestConext; with this change, the ID is generated beforehand and passed in to
the RequestContext constructor. Not much different here: a request ID is
generated and is available for use in the handling of the request.

On the response end, the middleware is again used, this time to attach the
x-openstack-request-id header, using the value of the generated request ID. The
current code attaches the x-compute-request-id header.

This change is a necessary step toward logging the mapping of request IDs across
OpenStack services.

UpgradeImpact: api-paste.ini is modified

Introduce a config option, mysql_sql_mode, that allows the user
to set the desired SQL mode for MySQL sessions.

For MySQL sessions, set the SQL mode session variable
accordingly.

For compatibility purposes, retain the mysql_traditional_mode
argument in method signatures, but only use it to override the

The laziness added to the role to reduce keystone
lookups assumes that all tenants are present in @tenants
if they are present in the system, and will not refresh
the class variable if the tenant is not found in it.

This patch adds a keystone lookup in the event of the supplied
tenant not being in the class variable, which can happen if a
tenant is created after prefetching.

the monkey patching should be done as early as possible. Not sure how we've
missed that requirement. In fact it is very important. For instance my

I have a feeling that could be the reason of some issues we experienced

This commit allows one to configure the db fields without running the actual
dbsync command. It remains compliant with the current implementation, leaving
exec {'ceilometer-dbsync': in the catalog. One, now, can decide if it wants
the dbsync to take place or not.

This is useful when one picks mongodb as a backend and wants to use replicaset
This way it can scale horizontally and painlessly using the initSync feature
of mongodb. With this pattern one can add new member of the replica set
easily.

Adds the --listen option to the /etc/sysconfig/libvirtd file.

Creating FC connections was not working due to several issues:

1. The lsfabric command in the Storwize/SVC omitted the delimeter and so
the output was not correctly parsed by the driver.
2. In some cases comparisons of WWPNs were not case insensitive - ensure
we compare lower-case WWPNs.
3. If the host supplied extra information in the connector (e.g. iSCSI
initiator name in case of an FC setup, or FC WWNNs/WWPNs in an iSCSI
setup), the driver would try to make those host mappings on the storage
too.  This could lead into unwanted behaviour and confusing error
messages (for example, in an FC setup reaching the maximum number of
iSCSI mappings).

In addition, unit tests weren't properly testing FC - instead they were
always testing iSCSI due to an error in parsing extra_specs. This patch
fixes that error and the unit tests as well.

These changes must all be made together for unit tests to pass.

Sending an account POST with an X-Account-Access-Control
header value that is valid json but not a valid ACL was
causing a 500 Internal Error if the value did not parse
to a dict due to an exception being raised in tempauth.py.

This patch modifies acl.py to check that the header value

tests are extended to cover these invalid header values.

This patch also enables json encoded dicts with whitespace

After no-compute-fanout-to-scheduler, host_ip was stored in the table
of compute_nodes. Host ip address should be considered as the hypervisor
attribute similar to the hypervisor_type, hypervisor_version etc, and
now those attributes such as hypervisor_type, hypervisor_version etc

DocImpact
1) Only administrators can view hypervisor detail in nova.
2) It can help improve debug capabilities for nova. For example, if
admin using SimpleCIDRAffinityFilter, then after VM is deployed, admin
can check if the VM was deployed successfully to the desired host by
checking ip address of the host via ""nova hypervisor-show host"".
3) Add host_ip to the output for ""nova hypervisor-show""

The default glance_control_exchange in Ceilometer has been changed

This change syncs log.py from oslo-incubator with commit
79e8a9a08daf563aa8a8d9280c9a6a27dcafc8f2

To honor RFC5424 add use_syslog_rfc_format config option
(default False, would be deprecated in J after existing
syslog format deprecation) which adds APP-NAME to syslog message
before MSG part to reflect application or service name.
Usable only with use_syslog, otherwise ignored.

During J, the default logging format for syslog should be changed
to always provide APP-NAME, thus use_syslog_rfc_format could be
deprecated in J as well.

Since the rootwrap code was graduating to a separate library,
so the rootwrap related change should just go into oslo.rootwrap
and when oslo.rootwrap is released, nova will pull in the library.

Fix bug causing nova-compute CPU to spike to 100%.

When there are hundreds of VMs running each time a VM is referenced
all of the VMs in the system will be read by nova-compute and then
filtered according to the UUID.

This is addressed by using an API (FindAllByUuid) which reads only
the specific VM. When a VM is created the config spec will be updated
with the UUID of the VM - that is, the field 'instanceUuid' will be
set. The search is later done on this field.

If the search fails then the old code will be invoked - this ensures
backward compatibility with running VM's. Thus all VM's created
without the 'instanceUuid' set will not be affected.

In addition to optimizing the search we also cache the VM reference.
This ensures that additional calls for the specific VM do not need
to query the backend for the reference.

This partially reverts commit 270d4f1d6b100c802a65b31d35e406528aa7fd27.

The plugin has been left so the plugin version is not made incompatible
by removing a call, but the call to it from vm_utils has been removed.

I expect this call will be re-introduced in future when we have identified
the cause of the race condition and the appropriate usage.

The original fix was made to fix bug 1258169 where the number of attempts
made were not sufficient, so this revert does not reduce the number of
attempts.

Add separate flags to allow the execution to skip the
volume_api.check_attach step, and to be able to call the
driver.attach_volume if needed. This will make the method modular enough
to be used in all cases where we actually ""attach"" volumes to instances.

Check attach should always be done in the API, followed immediately by a
reservation, to minimize the chance of a race. However currently we
do the check_attach step on the compute side during boot, so it needs to
stay. Other operations like attach_volume will have it reserved causing
this check to fail on the compute side, so we lay down the groundwork to
be able to skip it when calling attach().

Likewise, when booting, we don't need to call the virt driver
attach_volume method, as all the devices will be taken care of by the
boot code path.

Fix error handling in openstack-doc-test, now really abort if an
error occurs. The call to write in the exception was wrong and masked
the exception.

OpenStack infra changed the setup so that we now always destroy a node
after building - and thus have a clean node each time.
Now, when mvn is called, it needs to download lots of files into the
.ml2 repository (previously this was done already).
Now, the cripts start mvn jobs in parallel - and then we get a race
between these downloads and corruption of the .m2 directory.
Avoid this race with waiting for the first build job to finish before
starting further builds.

Add options --parallel/--noparallel to disable parallel building
completely.

Improve debug output.

$nova image-list can often run very slowly (or any image listing done
from nova) due to the fact that when it calls into glanceclient it
typically doesn't specify a page_size and so glanceclient uses its
default of 20.  For larger lists of images (eg. if there were lots of
snapshots, or if there were a lot of public images) this results in a
succession of queries from nova to the glance api server for a small
amount of images at a time.

Add a configuration item to nova image subsystem to allow deployers
to set a larger default query size in glance queries originating from
nova.  If not specified, existing behaviour applies.

This patch puts a process in
place for checking driver certification.

This patch marks all drivers as uncertified.

Every driver needs a follow on patch that
includes a link to a bug that contains the
certification log passing.  The patch should
include self.certified = True in the driver's
__init__.

When the volume manager starts and it tries to
init the uncertified driver, the volume manager
logs an error saying the driver is uncertified.
The volume manager leaves the driver in the
uninitialized state, which disables the driver.

This patch also adds an override for cinder.conf.
The override allows an admin to configure cinder
to allow the volume manager to start uncertified
drivers.

work in the gate either because of improper test setup or missing
devstack configuration.

Currently each plugin calls db.configure() within the plugin's __init__
class or defines an initialize() method that's sole job is to call this
method. Instead we should just call the super method of a plugin so that
db.configure() is called for us out of the db_base_plugin class.

Note: the only reason why I'm making this change is that I want to add
something to the __init__() class of the db_base_plugin that's needed for
the nova-event-callback blueprint and adding it in the base class of init
looks to be the best place.

With the push of v2.0 swiftclient the install of swfitclient on grizzly
stops working because the version is capped <2. This causes pip to
freak out replace the bin/swift script but leave the code from master
at >2 in the swiftclient namespace. This disconnect causes the exercises
that use the swiftclient cli to fail with import errors in the bin/swift
script. This commit skips these exercises to avoid the failures.

A number of trivial changes were merged to the oslo-incubator copy of
the rootwrap code while the code was being graduated. Those changes
should have been rejected (as the code was frozen while in graduation)
and applied to oslo.rootwrap instead.

Now that the oslo-incubator copy of the code was removed, we should
reapply those trivial changes to oslo.rootwrap instead, otherwise they
will just be lost:

* Remove vim header (original author: jogo)
* Make vertical white space after license header consistent (noorul)
* Removed copyright from empty files (jay-lau)

The GET response for a DLO has a Content-Length that's computed from
the container listing, but the response body's length is determined by
the segments. If a segment grows or shrinks between when the headers
are sent and when the segment is requested, this confuses clients.

For example, if the DLO is longer than its Content-Length and the
client sends another request on the same TCP connection, then it can
get leftover object bytes instead of an HTTP status line.
Alternately, if the headers it sends fill up the TCP buffers since
Swift won't read them until the first response is done, then deadlock
hilarity ensues.

If the DLO is shorter than its Content-Length, you're pretty much
guaranteed a deadlock: the client is waiting for the rest of the
response, and the server is waiting for a new request.

Now SegmentedIterable detects both these conditions and raises an
exception so that the TCP connection gets torn down. It can't save
this request, but it can stop the next one from getting hosed too.

When a L3 agent controlling multiple qrouter namespaces
restarts, it destroys all qrouter namespaces even if
some of them are still in use.  As a result, network
traffic could be stopped on the VMs that use the
networks associated with these namespaces.

So what is needed is for the L3 agent to preserve those
qrouter namespaces a L3 agent instance recognizes and to
destroy those it does not know about.

In certain cases the exception handling for backend errors
would be handled too broadly. This patch elevates the backend exception
to the application so that it can treat specific errors.

In the application we can now handle the following specific exceptions:
- FileAlreadyExists - for example when moving a directory to a directory
that already exists
- InvalidProperty - for example when using neutron and opaque networks
are not supported
- AlreadyExists - for example a port group already exists
- NotAuthenticated - for example the operation is denied as because a
session is not established
- CannotDeleteFile - the file cannot be deleted
- FileFault - a file access exception
- FileLocked - an attempt is made to lock a file that is
already in use
- FileNotFound - the specific file does not exist

This patch focuses on providing the shards controller for sqlalchemy.

As a bonus, a decorator is added that flags all methods that handles
all methods that raise a connection error.

The sqlalchemy driver passes all unit tests for the shards
controller. The initial suite is running on the sqlite engine.

A few general fixes have been applied:

- shards listing unit test now uses characters for names rather than
  numbers as strings to avoid sorting variations between storage
  engines
- cache.get_cache no longer takes a configOpts object

test_router_add_interface_subnet_with_port_from_other_tenant in
neutron.tests.unit.test_l3_plugin.L3NatTestCaseBase was mocking
neutron.context.Context thus performing multiple API requests
with the same context instance. As a context instance also has
a DB session attribute, this might cause unexpected side effects,
especially for plugins which process request asynchronously.

The plugin neutron.plugins.nicira.NeutronServicePlugin was being
affected.

This patch ensures each request has a different context object
without changing the unit test semantics.

It also refactors slightly test_edge_router.py in the nicira
unit test package to avoid executing twice the same unit tests.

This patch includes the ability to set the qos-specs for the
existing 3PAR qos settings (maxIOP and maxBWS) in addition to
the new settingis listed below. We would prefer that the
new qos-specs associated to a volume type be used, but this
patch also supports setting these values the old way in extra-specs
for backwards compatibility.

This patch also adds two additional personas to the list of
valid personas that are now support by the 3PAR backends.

DocImpact: Implements new qos settings
minIOPS - The minimum IOPs per second
minBWS - The minimum bandwidth per second
latency - The QOS I/O target latency
priority - The QOS scheduling priority (high, normal, low)
The priority defaults to normal

Two new personas added include HPUX and WindowsServer
