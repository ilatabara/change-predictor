I forsee us grappling with several challenges over the next few cycles: Successful clusters expand until they hit a wall, whether that's due to budget or physical space constraints. Swift will need to adapt to operate in more constrained environments. Total disk capacity is not the only measure of a cluster. Network bandwidth (both aggregate across the cluster as well as single-stream) and requests per second drive much of the client experience. Swift will need to be able to ration those between tenants, similar to how it can enforce capacity quotas. Operators are not the only ones interested in metrics and storage insights. Users want to know what their individual access patterns are like and how that has changed over time. I'm excited to see how much we can achieve in Caracal. Tim Burke ",,22,0

We have added the support to configure weight for each store to get rid of the problem with existing location strategy while downloading the image from specific store when multiple stores of same type are avialble. In 2024.1 (Caracal) cycle I would keep driving the key priorities, finishing the work we've had in flight and focus on making glance to configure multiple stores by default.

The following questions were asked by the TC: * How do you upgrade your version of OpenStack? * Once on a given release, do you use stable branches for bug-fix upgrades? * To which projects does your organization contribute maintenance resources, such as patches for bug fixes and code reviews on master or stable branches? * How do members of your organization contribute to OpenStack? * What prevents you or your organization from contributing more maintenance resources, or makes contributing difficult? * Other ways to participate? The intention of these questions was to understand how users are maintaining their OpenStack clouds and how they are interacting with the community. In the case that they weren't currently interacting with the community it was hoped that the questions would spark thoughts on how they could participate in the future. After the initial 2019 User Survey, the Technical Committee reviewed the responses and decided that we would keep the questions the same for future surveys with one exception. It was decided that the 'Other ways to participate' question should be changed to a free-form field that could be completed in the case that 'other' was selected in response to the question: 'How do members of your organization contribute to OpenStack'. This round of analysis will look at the results from the 2022 User Survey in comparison to the `2021 results <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/user_survey/analysis-04-2022.html>`_. As with the previous analysis, the analysis will be performed on a per-question basis with an over-all summary at the end.

Long story short, we auto-clamp down everything to 1400 bytes
due to VXLAN tunneling for multinode testing. But there are other
reasons to clamp it smaller, and we will need to clamp that further

Ages ago we supported pxelinux. Now, not really since it is long EOL.

And while troubleshooting bug # 2033430, we discovered we had option
210 in the DHCP payload from the server, which ended up being the
folder base path for a tftp client to self reference the structure,
but only with OVN.

Further troubleshooting with the neutron-dhcp-agent and dnsmasq
revealed we never actaully really sent that option to clients.

In other words, meaning it was always redundant. Since excess

it.

When using a volume from image in NFS, the conversion process
from QCOW2 to RAW doesn't update the volume metadata, this
prevents the resize operation to complete successfully as the
volume attachment stills reflects QCOW2 format.

This patch add a validation step which aligns the format from the volume
metadata with current format after conversion happens.

This is for NFS generic driver

This is a mitigation for an issue where sometimes, when tests are
tearing down, an FK is left on a table, and when that table is dropped
tests go boom (if we're lucky) or freeze indefinately.

This is obviously not an ideal solution, but if it works, we prove
where the problem is and mitigate it for all other developers while
we work on a long-term solution.

There's two questions in front of the TC, how to reshape EM moving
forward, and what to do with EM branches that are currently open.

This proposal only attempts to answer the first question, and is
being submitted together with other proposals that attempt to answer
the second question separately.

The resolution avoided creating formal guidelines for when to transition EM branches to EOL, only mentioning the inability of people to maintain the branch, broken CI, and inability to merge fixes. Recent discussions in the mailing list[1], forum[2], and in TC meetings highlighted that: - The reality of most current EM branches is that they are not always maintained and do not always receive security or bug fixes, or are in a state of not being able to merge those fixes if proposed. - There is an expectation from users and operators that these branches are in a state of maintenance and receiving the above. - These branches are still maintained by the project teams themselves and are taking attention and resources away from maintained branches and new development. Additionally, due to: - the automatic transition of all branches to extended maintenance - the requirement of a manual transition from extended maintenance to end-of-life - the interdependencies between project deliverables in testing infrastructure The transition of branches from extended maintenance to end-of-life is a burdensome process, both in work required, coordination, and goodwill, and only 3 branches in the 5 years since this policies introduction. There are currently 7 extended maintenance branches and this is starting to also affect the good operation of the QA infrastructure. Goals ----- This resolution identifies that - There is value in allowing a project team to choose to maintain a release for longer. - It is the project teams themselves that perform the maintenance in these branches rather than external actors (operators, users, vendors, etc.) and that the ideal of these branches encouraging collaboration from external actors didn't manifest. - There is a need for clear requirements and guidelines to maintain a standard of quality for those branches that matches the expectations of users, operators, and developers themselves. - The process of opting-in needs to be manual rather than automatic. This resolution therefore attempts to preserve the ability for teams to choose stay in extended maintenance and support their users for longer, codifying those requirements and guidelines for projects to fulfill, while also turning this into a manual opt-in process. The first branch this policy will apply to is stable/yoga. A sister resolution will be proposed concerning what to do with the current branches under extended maintenance. New Requirements for Staying in Extended Maintenance ---------------------------------------------------- - A project team needs to opt-in every cycle for all branches they want to keep supporting under extended maintenance by M-3. - The PTL or Stable branch liaison is the point of contact for this process. - No branches may be skipped between the oldest intended extended maintenance branch and the current supported releases. - The CI for all branches must be in good standing at the time of opt-in. - The PTL or stable branch liaison is the point of contact within the project team and responsible for the above requirements. Extended Maintenance and Dependencies ------------------------------------- OpenStack being an ecosystem of interrelated projects, one project team's ability to maintain a branch under extended maintenance is affect by the project teams of their dependencies. However, the burden of extended maintenance cannot be forced on teams that do not have the resources or desire to support a branch under extended maintenance. Blocking their ability to declare a branch as end-of-life simply puts that branch into a state of no maintenance that doesn't match the expectations outlined above. If a team chooses to continue maintaining a branch while a project that they depend on has chosen not to, they should consider to: - collaborate with that team, working together on fulfilling the requirement above of maintenance and creating an environment where teams work more closely together to fulfill their common objective. - shift their testing infrastructure to use tags instead of branches for their dependencies. This is already possible with the current tooling and will pull code that reflects the last state of the extended maintenance for that repository.

We have too many things to maintain, too few people to maintain and too
less sense not to rely on possible automations.
Basic idea of this change is to kick off with auto-generation of certain
parts of code where it is possible and makes sense to make out lives
easier. This may not always sound like a great idea just to generate
code instead of having required interfaces, but there are too many
places where lot of customizations are necessary and would kill any
attempt of generalization. So instead let us first generate code and
allow human to adapt it where it is necessary.

With this change a submodule ""codegenerator"" is being added with
intention to be invoked manually by a human once there are some changes
in the resources. At the moment it can be invoked as `python
codegenerator/generator.py --module openstack.identity.v3.project
--class-name Project --target osc --work-dir tmp` and let code appear in
tmp dir.

Since we do this it is possible and makes sense to adapt basic resource
class with some additional properties so that handling of microversions
can be easier (generate MV handling logic where attrs appear only in
certain versions).

Move scheduling logic from OVNClient._create_lrouter_port to an
ovsdbapp command so that scheduling decisions are made on up to
date information as the transaction applies.

One of the main use cases for routers with multiple gateway
ports are resiliency.  Whenever there are multiple LRPs present in
a LR, we want to ensure diverse placement of the ports to
minimize impact of chassis failure.

Charms for OpenStack Yoga supports both Ubuntu Focal and Jammy
which means Python 3.8 and Python 3.10.  Managing dependencies
across those two versions is non-trivial and we need to build
the charm on the series the charm is supposed to support.

Switch to using a binary build which allows pip's dependency
resolution to work.

This patch also drops the impish bundle and drops
test-requirements for < py36.

token needs to be generated, which tends to error like this:

  Check if inspection has completed.

Problem is, if we keep pounding on the door, we can actually worsen
the situation, and previously we would just just let tenacity
retry.

We will now hold for 30 seconds before proceeding, so we have
hopefully allowed the operation to complete.

Also fixes the error logging to help human's sanity.

fio packaging previously contained everything in one RPM,
but at some point for EL9 builds, this was split into multiple
RPMs where each engine used was put into it's own RPM.

In order for integrated disk benchmarking to work with
introspection, we use python-hardware. Python-hardware uses
fio, with libaio as a default option.

So now, we will attempt to install the other package which
should make users of the feature happier as their ramdisk
images will come with the contents required to do a benchmark
upfront.

token needs to be generated, which tends to error like this:

  Check if inspection has completed.

Problem is, if we keep pounding on the door, we can actually worsen
the situation, and previously we would just just let tenacity
retry.

We will now hold for 30 seconds before proceeding, so we have
hopefully allowed the operation to complete.

Also fixes the error logging to help human's sanity.

Current Redfish driver uses SimpleStorage resource
to collect disk information.
Storage resource is defined to provide more sophisticated
functionality over SimpsleStorage resource. Some Redfish
implementations may take transition from SimpleStorage to
Storage.
So Redfish driver's logic around disk should be provided
through Storage resource with SimpleStorage compatibility.

This commit does 2 things
* Use Storage resource instead of SimpleStorage, if possible
* Fix wrong disk indicator LED logic (SimpleStorage doesn't
  support indicator LED operation)

At present, whenever multiple additions/updates are made to LRPs
with gateway_chassis, each update is put in separate transactions
in an attempt to ensure the scheduler operates on updated
information for each iteration.

This is problematic because we don't have the luxury of creating
separate transactions for updates in all parts of the code base,
and it is also not very efficient.

The OVSDBapp library wraps the OVS Python IDL and provides
different semantics. Most notably the OVSDBapp represents a
Transaction as a list of command objects with `run_idl` methods
for execution at some point in the future. The main loop and the
command objects are not aware of changes made in the current
transaction until it is committed.

Fortunately, as an ovsdbapp transaction is committed, the
underlying OVS Python IDL is kept up to date during the course of
the transaction [0][1][2].

Move implementation of schduling of unhosted gateways into an
ovsdbapp command, using a plugin reference to the Neutron
OVNClient class for any calls into the Neutron code, allowing
scheduling decisions to be made on up to date data as the
transaction is applied.

This patch fixes the format of vnfdId for VNF package.
ETSI NFV-SOL002/003 does not specify the format of vnfdId, but the
current ""vnf package API"" can only handle vnfdId in UUID v4 format.
In compliance with ETSI NFV-SOL002/003, this patch fixes ""vnf
package API"" to handle vnfdId other than UUID v4 format.
And change the vnfdId of the VNF package used in ""test_individual_vnfc_mgmt_basic.py"" for FT to a format other than
UUID v4 format.

This is a cross-port of part of the fixtures.py file from Nova as
ironic_fixtures.py.

There are a number of things we want to handle with logging in tests:

* Redirect the logging to somewhere that we can test or dump it later.

* Ensure that as many DEBUG messages as possible are actually
   executed, to ensure they are actually syntactically valid (they
   often have not been).

* Ensure that we create useful output for tests that doesn't
  overwhelm the testing system (which means we can't capture the
  100 MB of debug logging on every run).

To do this we create a logger fixture at the root level, which
defaults to INFO and create a Null Logger at DEBUG which lets
us execute log messages at DEBUG but not keep the output.

To support local debugging OS_DEBUG=True can be set in the
environment, which will print out the full debug logging.

There are also a set of overrides for particularly verbose
modules to be even less than INFO.

Note: This will not catch errors in log messages if 1) The call to the
logger is mocked out, or 2) The unit test never exercises the logging
call.

Following up on the previous patch's reorder, stick the methods that
call out to the Cinder and Neutron APIs in greenthreads in order to run
them concurrently.

We chose to start both with spawn() and wait() for them. This makes us
safer in terms of logging/raising any exceptions either caught or handled by
the spawned function, and avoids two potentially racy situations.

First, in the volume attachment cleanup case, we wait() for that to be completed
before calling cleanup(), as the latter disconnects volumes.

Second, in the Neutron port binding case, we wait() for that to be
completed before calling to post_live_migration_at_source(), since the
latter unplugs vifs.

fio packaging previously contained everything in one RPM,
but at some point for EL9 builds, this was split into multiple
RPMs where each engine used was put into it's own RPM.

In order for integrated disk benchmarking to work with
introspection, we use python-hardware. Python-hardware uses
fio, with libaio as a default option.

So now, we will attempt to install the other package which
should make users of the feature happier as their ramdisk
images will come with the contents required to do a benchmark
upfront.

Right after keystone is upgraded from Zed to 2023.1
attempt to use previously cached tokens fails with
AttributeError, as tokens do not have oauth2_thumbprint
attribute yet.

Thus, services misbehave until cache is exipred or flushed.

In order to prevent this from happening, we use safe
getattr() instead of just assuming that attribute is there.

Until now neutron fullstack tests which were run by the same worker were
using same DB but after test content of the DB was cleaned.
This could cause problems e.g. for default security group rules which
weren't created properly in second test run by the same worker.

To fix that issue patch [1] was proposed and merged some time ago. But
this didn't solve the problem so this patch is effectively reverting [1]
and proposing another solution which will make each fullstack test to
use own DB and run db migration script.

As running DB migration before every test makes this jobs to run a bit
longer than it took before, this patch also increases timeout for the
fullstack job(s) to 3h (10800 seconds).

The 'force' parameter of os-brick's disconnect_volume() method allows
callers to ignore flushing errors and ensure that devices are being
removed from the host.

We should use force=True when we are going to delete an instance to
avoid leaving leftover devices connected to the compute host which
could then potentially be reused to map to volumes to an instance that
should not have access to those volumes.

We can use force=True even when disconnecting a volume that will not be
deleted on termination because os-brick will always attempt to flush
and disconnect gracefully before forcefully removing devices.

NOTE(elod.illes): the conflicts in status.py and test_status.py come
from patch Ic3ae48c57e61c4e45883fbae1328a448be025953, which was merged

The conflicts in test_driver.py is caused by missing backport of

Additionally some unit tests were added to ensure different use-cases
and URL patterns are covered.

For overcloud commands involving Bifrost (e.g. overcloud provision), we
use the Bifrost dynamic inventory. This runs bifrost_inventory.py which
gathers node and port information for all bare metal hosts. Because this
gets executed for each node in our inventory, it produces a large number
of API requests to Ironic, which grows as the number of hosts increases.

Halve the number of calls using the BIFROST_NODE_NAMES environment

With the patch to Bifrost [1], this is further reduced to 46 seconds.

For overcloud commands involving Bifrost (e.g. overcloud provision), we
use the Bifrost dynamic inventory. This runs bifrost_inventory.py which
gathers node and port information for all bare metal hosts. Because this
gets executed for each node in our inventory, it produces a large number
of API requests to Ironic, which grows as the number of hosts increases.

Halve the number of calls using the BIFROST_NODE_NAMES environment
variable, which restricts fetching port information to just the node
being queried. bifrost_inventory.py still performs one call for each
node, which must be fixed separately in Bifrost [1].

Time to query overcloud nodes' hardware introspection data for 44 hosts:

* before patch: 823 seconds
* after patch: 415 seconds

With the patch to Bifrost [1], this is further reduced to 46 seconds.

For the purposes of billing, it's useful to provide the information
about share type in oslo.messaging notifications.

Different share types can have different quality of service, limits,

For overcloud commands involving Bifrost (e.g. overcloud provision), we
use the Bifrost dynamic inventory. This runs bifrost_inventory.py which
gathers node and port information for all bare metal hosts. Because this
gets executed for each node in our inventory, it produces a large number
of API requests to Ironic, which grows as the number of hosts increases.

Halve the number of calls using the BIFROST_NODE_NAMES environment
variable, which restricts fetching port information to just the node
being queried. bifrost_inventory.py still performs one call for each
node, which must be fixed separately in Bifrost [1].

Time to query overcloud nodes' hardware introspection data for 44 hosts:

* before patch: 823 seconds
* after patch: 415 seconds

With the patch to Bifrost [1], this is further reduced to 46 seconds.

This patch writes this value on each new router created. It also

Publishing a fully hydrated context object in a notification would give
someone with access to that notification the ability to impersonate the
original actor through inclusion of sensitive fields.

Now, instead, we pare down the context object to the bare minimum before
passing it for serialization in notification workflows.

Volumes are now attached and detached by calling the StorPool API
directly.

Additionally refactor tests to reflect this.

When heal all(all=true) is executed, the stack id will be updated.
Once the stack id is not saved in vnf_instance, it will cause an
exception.
In this patch, in heal and terminate, if the stack id does not
exist, use the stack name instead to call the heat api.

In some edge cases found during a scalability test we noticed that some
VMs failed to get a DHCP lease. During investigation it was found that
the ovnmeta-<uuid> network namespace was not present in the compute node
where the VM was running, with the ovn-metadata logs saying:

2023-04-18 06:56:09.864 353474 DEBUG neutron.agent.ovn.metadata.agent [-]
There is no metadata port for network 9029c393-5c40-4bf2-beec-27413417eafa
or it has no MAC or IP addresses configured, tearing
the namespace down if needed _get_provision_params
/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/neutron/agent/ovn/metadata/agent.py:495

When the system is under stress there's a chance that the information of
the metadata port has not yet being populated by OVN in the Southbound
database so when the PortBindingChassisEvent happens and the code tries
to find the metadata port or its IP information (updated during subnet
creation) it does not find it and silently fails with the error above,
tearing down the network namespace for that network.

Note the same test with less concurrency does not replicate this error.

This patch adds a retry mechanism when fetching the metadata port for
a maximum of 10 seconds. That (hopefully) should be enough for OVN to
propagate the information between the databases. The patch also improves
a little the error logged to discriminate between the port not being
found or the IP configuration being missing.

For overcloud commands involving Bifrost (e.g. overcloud provision), we
use the Bifrost dynamic inventory. This runs bifrost_inventory.py which
gathers node and port information for all bare metal hosts. Because this
gets executed for each node in our inventory, it produces a large number
of API requests to Ironic, which grows as the number of hosts increases.

Halve the number of calls using the BIFROST_NODE_NAMES environment
variable, which restricts fetching port information to just the node
being queried. bifrost_inventory.py still performs one call for each
node, which must be fixed separately in Bifrost [1].

Time to query overcloud nodes' hardware introspection data for 44 hosts:

* before patch: 823 seconds
* after patch: 415 seconds

With the patch to Bifrost [1], this is further reduced to 46 seconds.

This change adds a configuration variable
""exit_on_libvirt_failure"". This variable is set
to False on default. When it's set to True and
ceilometer cannot reconnect to libvirt socket
even after multiple tries, this change makes
ceilometer terminate immediately.

This is a reaction to an observed situation,
where nova restarted its containers and deleted
and recreated the /run/libvirt folder. This
caused the ceilometer container to not be able
to read the libvirt socket from inside that
folder. Terminating ceilometer stops the not
working ceilometer container, which gets
automatically restarted. After the restart,
ceilometer is able to connect to the socket
again.

When using the config libvirt-image-backend=rbd, VMs
created from image have their disk data stored in ceph
instead of the compute node itself.

When performing live-migrations, both nodes need to
access the same ceph credentials to access the VM's
disk in ceph, but this is currently not possible
if the nodes involved pertain to different
nova-compute charm apps.

This patch changes app name sent to ceph to 'nova-compute',
allowing all nova-compute apps to use the same ceph auth.

This patch also includes the charmhelpers sync
from PR: #840

The ovn_controller update tasks are in external_update but
reused by upgrade process. During the upgrade we run on
all hosts and not just undercloud causing the tasks to get
executed n times over so in case of 500 nodes we would end
up restarting ovn_controller 500 times.

This should be solved in upgrade by simply triggering only
on first controller.

The run_once would not work here due to tripleo_free strategy.

When a volume is created in NetApp ONTAP, it has a few autosize
attributes that are set by default. The values of the attributes
are defined according to the volume type (DP/RW).

During the replica promotion, the types are swaped between source
and destination volumes, but the autosize values were not being
updated. This patch fixes this behavior, calling an autosize reset
after promoting the replica.

The old method for operation allowed_address_pairs is 'update_port' and

The new method of updating allowed_address_pairs is to atomically modify it
by 'add_allowed_address_pairs' and 'remove_allowed_address_pairs'.

During the Ceph OSDs deployment, a custom crush hierarchy can be defined and passed using the ``--crush-hierarchy`` option. As per `Ceph Host Management`_, by doing this the `location` attribute is added to the Hosts spec. The location attribute will only affect the initial CRUSH location Subsequent changes of the location property will be ignored. Also, removing a host will not remove any CRUSH generated bucket. Example: Apply a custom crush hierarchy to the deployed OSDs ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ If the file ``crush_hierarchy.yaml`` contains something like the following:: --- ceph_crush_hierarchy: ceph-0: root: default rack: r0 ceph-1: root: default rack: r1 ceph-2: root: default rack: r2 and the following command is run:: openstack overcloud ceph deploy \ deployed_metal.yaml \ -o deployed_ceph.yaml \ --osd-spec osd_spec.yaml \ --crush-hierarchy crush_hierarchy.yaml Then the Ceph cluster will bootstrap with the following Ceph OSD layout:: [ceph: root@ceph-0 /]# ceph osd tree ID CLASS WEIGHT TYPE NAME STATUS REWEIGHT PRI-AFF -1 0.02939 root default -3 0.00980 rack r0 -2 0.00980 host ceph-node-00 0 hdd 0.00980 osd.0 up 1.00000 1.00000 -5 0.00980 rack r1 -4 0.00980 host ceph-node-01 1 hdd 0.00980 osd.1 up 1.00000 1.00000 -7 0.00980 rack r2 -6 0.00980 host ceph-node-02 2 hdd 0.00980 osd.2 up 1.00000 1.00000 .. note:: Device classes are automatically detected by Ceph, but crush rules are associated to pools and they still be defined using the CephCrushRules parameter during the overcloud deployment.

in [1] a lock was introduced with the goal of preventing subnets from
being deleted while ports are being created in them in parallel.
This was acheived by aquiring an exclusive lock on the row of the
subnet in the Subnet table when adding/modifying a port or deleting
the subnet.

However as this was a exclusive lock it also prevented concurrent port
modifications on the same subnet from happening. This can cause
performance issues on environment with large shared subnets (e.g. a
large external subnet).

To reduce the lock contention for this case we split the lock in two
parts:

* For normal port operations we will aquire a shared lock on the
  row of the subnet. This allows multiple such operations to happen in
  parallel.
* For deleting a subnet we will aquire an exclusive lock on the row of
  the subnet. This lock can not be aquired when there is any shared
  lock currently on the row.

With this we maintain the same locking level as before, but reduce the
amount of lock contention happening and thereby improve throughput.

HINT: This isn't a clean backport, as we keep the subnet in-use field.
We can't backport the db update that would remove the field.

The performance improvement can be measured using rally test [2].
(improving from 21 to 18 seconds).
Alternatively it can be tested using 250 parallel curl calls to create a
port in the same network. This improves from 113s to 42s.

in [1] a lock was introduced with the goal of preventing subnets from
being deleted while ports are being created in them in parallel.
This was acheived by aquiring an exclusive lock on the row of the
subnet in the Subnet table when adding/modifying a port or deleting
the subnet.

However as this was a exclusive lock it also prevented concurrent port
modifications on the same subnet from happening. This can cause
performance issues on environment with large shared subnets (e.g. a
large external subnet).

To reduce the lock contention for this case we split the lock in two
parts:

* For normal port operations we will aquire a shared lock on the
  row of the subnet. This allows multiple such operations to happen in
  parallel.
* For deleting a subnet we will aquire an exclusive lock on the row of
  the subnet. This lock can not be aquired when there is any shared
  lock currently on the row.

With this we maintain the same locking level as before, but reduce the
amount of lock contention happening and thereby improve throughput.

HINT: This isn't a clean backport, as we keep the subnet in-use field.
We can't backport the db update that would remove the field.

The performance improvement can be measured using rally test [2].
(improving from 21 to 18 seconds).
Alternatively it can be tested using 250 parallel curl calls to create a
port in the same network. This improves from 113s to 42s.

Current, users can config default datastore registry for managers not by
verions. This make you can flexible when have some experimental
datastore.

With this patch, users with the administrator role can configure the
datastore registry external for each datastore version using a command,
without editing configuration files.

Patch adds option to limit recursion depth for to_data_model.
This hack is useful for situations, when only one layer of attributes of
Model are necessary.
As example it could be used on GET request:
/v2/lbaas/pools/<pool_id>/members/

With this changes to_data_model will not iterate through all nodes in

The _populate_mtu_and_subnets_for_ports function does not scale well as
the number of subnets increases. This is a result of two issues.

Firstly, it has a nested for loop where the outer loop iterates through
the router ports and the inner loop iterates through all of subnets
attached to a router.

Additionally, the function appends subnet information for every subnet
to a list under the extra_subnets key. This is set on every port and so
the response size increases significantly alongside the number of
subnets. While this doesn't slow the function down too much, it
dramatically increases the size of the overall sync_routers response.

To address these issues, this patch splits the nested for loop into two
distinct loops and the latter fetches the relevant information from the
dictionary which is created by the former.

The response size of the function is reduced by setting the
extra_subnets key on only the ports which need this information. The
agent code does not read this key for ports unless the device owner is
network:floatingip_agent_gateway or network:router_gateway.

This change is part of a set of changes in several projects that are nessecary to fully implement ovn-bgp-agent.

By default ``packing_host_numa_cells_allocation_strategy`` variable is set to ``True``. It leads to attempt to chose NUMA node(s) with less amount of free resources (or in other words **more used** NUMA nodes) first. It is so-called ""pack"" strategy - we try to place as much as possible load at **more used** host's NUMA node until it will be completely exhausted. And only after we will choose **most used** host's NUMA node from the rest available nodes on host. ""Spread"" strategy is reverse to ""pack"" strategy. The NUMA node(s) with **more free** resources will be used first. So ""spread"" strategy will try to balance load between all NUMA nodes and keep number of free resources on all NUMA nodes as more equal as possible. Host's NUMA nodes are placed in list and list is sorted based on strategy chosen and resource available in each NUMA node. Sorts are performed on same list one after another, so the last sort implemented is the sort with most priority. The python performed so-called stable sort. It means that each sort executed on same list will change order of list items only if item's property we sort on differs. If this properties in all list's items are equal than elements order will not changed. Sorts are performed on host's NUMA nodes list in the following order: * sort based on available memory on node(first sort-less priority) * sort based on cpu usage (in case of shared CPUs requested by guest VM topology) or free pinned cpus otherwise. * sort based on number of free PCI device on node(last sort-top priority) Top sorting priority is for host's NUMA nodes with PCI devices attached. If VM requested PCI device(s) logic **always** puts host's NUMA nodes with more PCI devices at the beginnig of the host's NUMA nodes list. If PCI devices isn't requested by VM than NUMA nodes with no (or less) PCI device available will be placed at the beginnig of the list. .. caution:: The described logic for PCI devices is used **both** for ""pack"" and ""spread"" strategies. It is done to keep backward compatibility with previous nova versions. During ""pack"" logic implementation rest (two) sorts are performed with sort order to move NUMA nodes with more available resources (CPUs and memory) at the END of host's NUMA nodes list. Sort based on memory is the first sort implemented and has least priority. During ""spread"" logic implementation rest (two) sorts are performed with sort order to move NUMA nodes with more available resources (CPUs and memory) at the BEGINNING of host's NUMA nodes list. Sort based on memory is the first sort implemented and has least priority. Finally resulting list (after all sorts) is passed next and attempts to place VM's NUMA node to host's NUMA node are performed starting from the first host's NUMA node in list."," The NUMA node(s) used are normally chosen at random. However, if a PCI passthrough or SR-IOV device is attached to the instance, then the NUMA node that the device is associated with will be used. This can provide important performance improvements. However, booting a large number of similar instances can result in unbalanced NUMA node usage. Care should be taken to mitigate this issue.

When adding a dashboard to grafana the containers aren't restarted when
they should be. This is due to a bug in Kolla where the logic to
determine whether or the container needs to be restarted fails in the
case where the file does not exist in the container. This patch adds

When Nova is deployed with a mix of x86 and arm systems
(for example), it may be necessary to deploy both 'novnc' and
'serialconsole' proxy services on the same host in order to
service the mixed compute estate.

This patch introduces a list which defines the required proxy
console types.

When running the OVN db sync tool, the log messages are
inconsistent between functions, attempt to sanitize them
so the output is a little more structured by:

1) Always logging a start/end time for each major section

2) Always use LOG.warning when fixing inconsistencies

3) Be consistent using 'OVN NB/SB DB' in messages

4) Try to use full name of object being updated, for example,
   'floating IP' not 'fip'

Also fixed the following:

1) Only drop into blocks if in SYNC_MODE_REPAIR and there
   is work to be performed

2) Random text fix-ups

Functionally the code is unchanged.

The RBD driver uses libraries that are programmed in C, which means that
greenlets cannot do thread switching on I/O, so we can see the RBD
driver using the tpool library all over the place.

This is inconvenient because we have a tendency, when codiging and
reviewing, to miss places where native threads are needed, which may end
up blocking the whole Cinder service for that backend, or at the very
least reducing its responsiveness.

Now that we can log in native threads (thanks to Change-Id
Iac1b0891ae584ce4b95964e6cdc0ff2483a4e57d) we can take a different
approach in the RBD driver.

This patch introduces a couple of decorators: ""on_native_thread"" and
""on_any_thread"".

Thanks to the ""on_native_thread"" coders can now tell that a specific
method or all methods in a class must always be run in a native thread,
and the decorator will take care of switching from a greenthread to a
native thread or to stay as it is if the code is already running on a
native thread.

The decorator has a tiny overhead, since it needs to check if it's a
green or native thread, but with the ""on_any_thread"" decorator we can
remove this overhead for methods we know can run on greenthreads.

This patch uses the ""on_native_thread"" decorator on the ""RBDDriver""
class, which not only makes the code easier to read, but also means that
any new code will run by default on native threads, which is the safest
assumption since we won't be blocking.

Since now the RBD driver doesn't explicitly call the tpool methods we
have to make some additional changes besides the removal of tpool method
calls:

- Changing class name from ""RBDVolumeProxy"" to ""RBDVolume"" since it's no
  longer proxying the calls via tpool.Poxy.

- Driver's RBDProxy method is no longer necessary since we don't need a
  tpool.Poxy, so we can use the same rbd.RBD instance in the driver.

This patch requires the next oslo.log release that includes the fix for
logging in eventlet native threads so they don't block.

parameter: the legacy 'sort_key'/'sort_dir' parameters and the combined

The mcast_flood_reports option was being enabled on LSPs as a workaround
for a problem in core OVN. The issue in core OVN has been fixed and this
workaround is now causing an increase in the number of actions on the
table 38 of OVN (at the risk of hitting a size limit).

This patch disables the mcast_flood_reports option on newer versions of
OVN while keeping the backward compatibility with the old ones.

Since the fix in core OVN does not expose any information to the CMS to
tell us that the issue is fixed this patch uses the NB DB schema version
to determine if this is an old or a new OVN version.

This patch concerns the time when a VM is being unshelved and the
compute manager set the task_state to spawning, claimed resources of
the VM and then called driver.spawn(). So the instance is in vm_state
SHELVED_OFFLOADED, task_state spawning.

If at this point a new update_available_resource periodic job is
started that collects all the instances assigned to the node to
calculate resource usage. However the calculation assumed that a
VM in SHELVED_OFFLOADED state does not need resource allocation on
the node (probably being removed from the node as it is offloaded)
and deleted the resource claim.

Given all this we ended up with the VM spawned successfully but having
lost the resource claim on the node.

This patch changes what we do in vm_state SHELVED_OFFLOADED, task_state
spawning. We no longer delete the resource claim in this state and
keep tracking the resource in stats.

Let's use a wrapper script that handles signals correctly.

Configure cloudkitty_influxdb_use_ssl automatically based on the value
of kolla_enable_tls_internal. Set cloudkitty_elasticsearch_cafile,
cloudkitty_influxdb_cafile and cloudkitty_prometheus_cafile to
openstack_cacert.

Disable certificate validation when bootstrapping the InfluxDB database:
the influxdb_database module and the InfluxDB 1.x Python client don't
support specifying a CA certificate file.

This fixes bootstrap and execution of CloudKitty with internal TLS.

Storage firmware versions for GAD <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< If you are using a VSP F350, F370, F700, F900 storage system or a VSP G350, G370, G700,G900 storage system in a Global-Active Device configuration, make sure the firmware version is 88-03-21 or later . Creating a Global-Active Device environment <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Before using Global-Active Device, create the prerequisite environment, such as connecting remote paths, configuring a quorum disk, and creating a virtual storage machine (VSM), by other storage system management tools. Hitachi block storage driver supports the following configurations. * Configuration where the P-VOL is not registered to a VSM * Configuration where the P-VOL is registered to a VSM For details, see the Workflow for creating a GAD environment in the `Global-Active Device User Guide`_ Hitachi block storage driver automatically runs procedures that are described in the `Global-Active Device User Guide`_. You can skip configuring the following procedures, which are described in the section Workflow for creating a GAD environment: * The following steps of Setting up the secondary storage system: - Setting the GAD reserve attribute on the S-VOL - Creating a host group (Only if the ``hitachi_group_request`` parameter is True) - Creating the S-VOL - Adding an LU path to the S-VOL * Updating the CCI configuration definition files * Creating the GAD pair * Adding an alternate path to the S-VOL You must register the information about the secondary storage system to the REST API server in the primary site and register the information about the primary storage system to the REST API server in the secondary site. For details about how to register the information, see the `Hitachi Command Suite Configuration Manager REST API Reference Guide`_ or the `Hitachi Ops Center API Configuration Manager REST API Reference Guide`_. .. note:: * The users specified for the ``hitachi_rest_user`` parameter and the ``hitachi_gad_rest_user`` parameter must have following roles: * Storage Administrator (View & Modify) * Storage Administrator (Remote Copy) * Reserve unused host group IDs (iSCSI target IDs) for the resource groups related on the VSM. Reserve the IDs in ascending order. The number of IDs you need to reserve is 1 plus the sum of the number of controller odes and the number of compute nodes. For details on how to reserve a host group ID (iSCSI target ID), see `Global-Active Device User Guide`_. * The LUNs of the host groups (iSCSI targets) of the specified ports on the primary storage system must match the LUNs of the host groups (iSCSI targets) of the specified ports on the secondary storage system. If they do not match, match the LUNs for the primary storage system with those for the secondary storage system. * When you use a same storage system as secondary storage system for Global-Active Device configuration and backend storage system for general use at the same time, you cannot use the same ports between different backend storage systems. Please specify different ports in ``hitachi_target_ports`` parameter, ``hitachi_compute_target_ports`` parameter, or ``hitachi_rest_pair_target_ports`` parameter between different backend storage systems. Create volume in a Global-Active Device configuration <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< If you create a Cinder volume in a Global-Active Device configuration, each Global-Active Device pair is mapped to a Cinder volume. To create a volume by using the Create Volume with the Global-Active Device attribute specified, specify ``hbsd:topology=active_active_mirror_volume`` as an extra spec for the volume type as follows: .. code-block:: ini # cinder type-create <volume type name> # cinder type-key <volume type name> \ set hbsd:topology=active_active_mirror_volume # cinder create --volume-type <volume type name> <size> .. note:: * In this case, the following restrictions apply: * You cannot create a volume for which the deduplication and compression function is enabled. * Note the following if the configuration is ""P-VOL registered to a VSM"": * Be sure to create volumes with the Global-Active Device attribute specified. * Before performing a volume operation, you must set a virtual LDEV number for every P-VOL. Unavailable Cinder functions <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Following cinder functions are unavailable in a Global-Active Device configuration: * Migrate a volume (storage assisted) * Manage Volume * Unmanage Volume .. note:: In addition, if the configuration is ""P-VOL registered to a VSM"", the backup creation command of the Backup Volume functions cannot be run with the --snapshot option or the --force option specified. Maximum number of copy pairs and consistency groups --------------------------------------------------- The maximum number of Thin Image pairs that can be created for each LDEV assigned to a volume (or snapshot) is restricted on a per-storage-system basis. If the number of pairs exceeds the maximum, copying cannot proceed normally. For information about the maximum number of copy pairs and consistency groups that can be created, see the `Hitachi Thin Image User Guide`_. Data deduplication and compression ---------------------------------- Use deduplication and compression to improve storage utilization using data reduction. For details, see Capacity saving function: data deduplication and compression in the Provisioning Guide. **Enabling deduplication and compression** To use the deduplication and compression on the storage models, your storage administrator must first enable the deduplication and compression for the DP pool. For details about how to enable this setting, see the description of pool management in the `Hitachi Command Suite Configuration Manager REST API Reference Guide`_ or the `Hitachi Ops Center API Configuration Manager REST API Reference Guide`_. .. note:: * Do not set a subscription limit (virtualVolumeCapacityRate) for the DP pool. Creating a volume with deduplication and compression enabled <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< To create a volume with the deduplication and compression setting enabled, enable deduplication and compression for the relevant volume type. **Procedure** 1. To enable the deduplication and compression setting, specify deduplication_compression for ``hbsd:capacity_saving`` in the extra specs for the volume type. 2. When creating a volume of the volume type created in the previous step, you can create a volume with the deduplication and compression function enabled. Deleting a volume with deduplication and compression enabled <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< The cinder delete command finishes when the storage system starts the LDEV deletion process. The LDEV cannot be reused until the LDEV deletion process is completed on the storage system. Port scheduler -------------- You can use the port scheduler function to reduce the number of WWNs, which are storage system resource. In Hitachi block storage driver, if host groups are created automatically, host groups are created for each compute node or VM (in an environment that has a WWN for each VM). If you do not use the port scheduler function, host groups are created and the same WWNs are registered in all of the ports that are specified for the parameter ``hitachi_compute_target_ports`` or for the parameter ``hitachi_target_ports``. For Hitachi storage devices, a maximum of 255 host groups and 255 WWNs can be registered for one port. When volumes are attached, the upper limit on the number of WWNs that can be registered might be unexpectedly exceeded. For the port scheduler function, when the cinder-volume service starts, the Fibre Channel Zone Manager obtains the WWNs of active compute nodes and of active VMs. When volumes are attached, the WWNs are registered in a round-robin procedure, in the same order as the order of ports specified for the parameter ``hitachi_compute_target_ports`` or for the parameter ``hitachi_target_ports``. If you want to use the port scheduler function, set the ``hitachi_port_scheduler`` parameter. For details about the parameter, see Hitachi block storage driver specific parameters. .. note:: * Only Fibre Channel is supported. For details about ports, see Fibre Channel connectivity. * If a host group already exists in any of the ports specified for the parameter ``hitachi_compute_target_ports`` or for the parameter ``hitachi_target_ports``, no new host group will be created on those ports. * Restarting the cinder-volume service re-initializes the round robin scheduling determined by the ``hitachi_compute_target_ports`` parameter or the ``hitachi_target_ports`` parameter. * The port scheduler function divides up the active WWNs from each fabric controller and registers them to each port. For this reason, the number of WWNs registered may vary from port to port. Port assignment using extra specs --------------------------------- Defining particular ports in the Hitachi-supported extra spec ``hbsd:target_ports`` determines which of the ports specified by the ``hitachi_target_ports`` or the ``hitachi_compute_target_ports`` parameters are used to create LUN paths during volume attach operations for each volume type. .. note:: * Use a comma to separate multiple ports. * In a Global-Active Device configuration, use the extra spec ``hbsd:target_ports`` for the primary storage system and the extra spec ``hbsd:remote_target_ports`` for the secondary storage system. * In a Global-Active Device configuration, the ports specified for the extra spec ``hbsd:target_ports`` must be specified for both the parameter for the primary storage system (``hitachi_target_ports`` or ``hitachi_compute_target_ports``) and the parameter for the secondary storage system (``hitachi_mirror_target_ports`` or ``hitachi_mirror_compute_target_ports``). ..

At the moment we don't restart services if systemd unit file is changed.

We knowingly prevent systemd_service role handlers to execute
by providing `state: started` as otherwise service will be restarted twice.
With that now  we ensure that role handlers will also listen for systemd

This patch adds support for the QoS extension in the OVS driver of
the Trunk service. Same as in a ML2 driver extension, the Trunk
service OVS driver creates a ``L2AgentExtensionsManager`` instance
that will load the ``TrunkConfig`` object.

The extension manager will load the ``QosAgentExtension``, if
configured in the ML2 configuration section. The QoS agent extension
will load the ``QosOVSTrunkAgentDriver``.

The ``QosOVSTrunkAgentDriver`` has a RPC listener attending any PORT
event. If the port belongs to a Trunk local bridge and this bridge
has an instance port, the ``QosOVSTrunkAgentDriver`` calls the
``QosAgentExtension`` instance ""handle_port"" and ""delete_port"" methods.
Those methods will manage the internal policy map cache and will
call the ``QosOVSTrunkAgentDriver`` methods to add or delete the
bandwidth limits in the OVS backend.

NOTE: the Trunk OVS driver QoS extension only supports bandwidth limit
rule type, egress direction.

As database backups can grow substantially in size, compressing backups
helps to preserve disk space.
While the mariabackup utility offers no compression by itself, we can
stream the backup into a compression tool to create an archive [1].
The xtrabackup_checkpoints file, which contains metadata on a backup,
gets stored alongside the archive, allowing to create incremental
backups from non-compressed backups and vice-versa [2].
One thing to note, is that compressed backups cannot be prepared in
advance, this step must be manually carried out by the user.
Backup compression is disabled by default and different compressors
can be chosen (zstd, xz, ...), with gzip being the default.

In cases where there are multiple stacks for the overcloud, as in

executed in 2 or more steps.
Currently when a rotation is executed for the first overcloud

This patch allow the key rotation to be executed in multiple steps
to properly rotate the keys on all overcloud stack.

I've contributed to Tacker as a PTL to provide a generic VNF Manager to industiries. We have implemented or improved several features such as monitoring with Prometheus for containers or policy management for multi domain usecases in addition to introduce the latest ETSI-NVF standard compliant features. We also revised unstable unit/functional tests for which we have been suffered several times for unexpected failures and waste of time as one of the our goals for efficiency of our development, and documents for users to demonstrate usecases in practical examples. In the next cycle, I'd like to continue to improving Tacker for the 5G network includes both a radio-access network and a core network to provide operators as we've focused on. Deploying Tacker as Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) in O-RAN architecture is one of our plans for realizing the scenario. Tacker team has already contributed to ETSI NFV and O-RAN SC communities while getting feedbacks from them and enforced relationship among them gradually. I'd appreciate if we make some more progress for OpenStack and these communities. Regards, Yasufumi (yasufum) ",,19,0

Patch [1] set ""reside-on-redirect-chassis"" to False in the Logical
router ports which belongs to vlan/flat tenant networks.
This is fine when there are Floating IPs associated with ports from such
tenant networks but it is causing issue with port forwardings.
PFs are implemented in the OVN backend as Loadbalancer and are
centralized. So traffic to/from such PF should be centralized through
controller node.
To make it working, for vlan/flat tenant networks
""reside-on-redirect-chassis"" option is set to True when there is any PF
on that network and set back to False when PF is removed.

During this cycle we introduced Ubuntu Jammy images, and initiated extensive testing for Jammy-based deployments. ### Other Improvements: - Enhanced Compute-kit job stability by adopting a multinode test environment for specific releases. - Cleaned up the OpenStack-Helm storyboard. Over 100 stories were reviewed, verified and fixed or closed. as outdated. - Numerous minor fixes and adjustments, including updates for recent Kubernetes releases. A big thank you to everyone for your contributions. ## Looking Ahead ### Documentation: The documentation still needs to be improved and aligned with all the recent changes. Users need clear understanding of how to deploy/upgrade Openstack components and which releases and scenarios are thoroghly tested and expected to work. ### Compatibility: We plan to continue expanding support for recent OpenStack and Kubernetes releases and additional Linux distributions. I am eager to continue in my role as PTL to ensure these initiatives move forward. Thank you, Vladimir Kozhukalov kozhukalov@gmail.com ",,49,0

With extensive experience with Kubernetes, I understand its importance in the modern cloud ecosystem. I have been actively involved in numerous Kubernetes projects, honing my expertise and contributing to this pivotal technology. In addition to my Kubernetes expertise, I have advocated for integrating Kubernetes more deeply into the OpenStack community. I believe in the power of these two technologies combined and have consistently pushed for their synergy. As PTL, I will focus on enhancing the stability and reliability of OpenStack-Helm, easing the deployment and management of OpenStack environments on Kubernetes. I am committed to fostering collaboration and open communication. I believe in the power of open source and the importance of accessible, reliable, and beneficial software for all users.

I am Mohammed Naser and I am committed to driving the Magnum project to new heights. I have been deeply involved in Magnum, driving adoption of the Cluster API and building much of the infrastructure that has made Magnum usable. My dedication to Magnum and my extensive experience with Kubernetes and OpenStack have equipped me with the knowledge and skills necessary to lead this project. As PTL, I will focus on not only enhancing the integration of Cluster API in Magnum but also on pushing the boundaries of what Magnum can achieve. I aim to improve the overall user experience, bring more of the Cluster API's usability into Magnum, and pioneer new features and capabilities. I am committed to fostering an environment of collaboration and open communication. I believe that everyone in our community has a voice and that together, we can make Magnum an even more powerful tool. I am excited about the possibility of leading the Magnum project and working with all of you to continue driving innovation in the OpenStack ecosystem. Thank you for considering my candidacy. I look forward to potentially serving as your PTL and contributing to the ongoing success of the Magnum project. Best regards, Mohammed Naser ",,29,0

Observing the scheduler for a series of live-migrations, the same
subset of hosts is always chosen no matter how loaded they get.
The time frame and the subset size coincide with the configuration
values for `update_resources_interval` and `host_subset_size`.

Following a live-migration event, the destination host is only updated
when the periodic task calls `update_available_resources`. In this time
interval none of the host's resources are update inside the DB. This
means the scheduler doesn't update it's weights and will always
choose the same hosts.

For live migration events, `update_available_resource` is called in the
pre and post migration hooks only on the source host. Now the resources
are updated in the post live-migration call on the destination as well.

During the past cycles, there was a lot of effort on promoting contributor collaboration through different activities and it helped us to make progress on closing gaps between the Manila APIs and other clients consuming them, as well as tackling tech debt and getting new features and drivers merged. I feel energized to continue pushing on these areas, but also put some focus on: * Working on the stability of our upstream CI first party jobs and also checking with third party CI maintainers to ensure their CI is healthy and reporting valid results. * Enhancing the review bandwidth and doing more actions to encourage more reviews from people submitting code to the Manila code base. * Work on documentation to help new contributors understand what are the requirements when proposing new features, and also continue the effort to cover the lack of documentation we have on third party CI setups for Manila, helping potential new vendors to quickly set up their CI systems.

I have been the Cinder PTL for the last 3 cycles namely Zed, 2023.1 (Antelope) and 2023.2 (Bobcat). Few of the notable things we achieved in the past cycle are: * OpenStack Client and SDK work: We started two efforts in parallel: ** Migrate OSC commands to SDK[1] ** Add support of missing operations in SDK[2] We are making good progress in this area but looking at the work items[3], this effort will span across the next couple of cycles to be completed. * Security Vulnerabilities: We were able to address a major security vulnerability CVE-2023-2088 that prevents end users to delete volume attachments directly leaving left over devices on compute hosts resulting in data leaks. * Transition from EM to Unmaintained: We noticed the inactive contribution in extended maintenance branches and the need to fix gate issues from time to time. Also the project team is responsible to merge changes into these EM branches. After the recent CVE-2023-2088 wasn't proposed to EM branches, it was clear that the efforts were not worth the outcome so the Cinder team initiated a discussion regarding EOLing the current EM branches. There is a resolution from TC to migrate EM to unmaintained branches[4]. * Outreachy Mentorship: We had a successful quarter of outreachy internship from May-August 2023 with 2 interns, Desire and Toheeb. They were able to get a good amount of work done on the project ""Automating generation of api-ref samples"". * Review bandwidth and quality: We have been able to maintain good quantity and quality of reviews from contributors contributing from different organizations. Here are some work items we are planning for the next cycle (2024.1): * We still lack review bandwidth since one of our active cores, Sofia, couldn't contribute to Cinder anymore hence we will be looking out for potential core reviewers. * Continue working on migrating from cinderclient to OSC (and SDK) support. * Continue with the current cinder events like festival of XS reviews, midcycle, video meeting once a month etc that provides regular team interaction and helps tracking and discussion of ongoing work throughout the cycle.

Primary differences:
- script to generate pod-specific certs has been moved under
  values.conf.vencrypt.cert_init_sh to allow for it to be
  overridden if necessary
- leaves the creation of a (sub)issuer for vencrypt as

OSA playbooks only call this role once for all Ironic containers
(API and inspector). As a result, the wheel builds only happen
once. If the first host (which is responsible for wheel builds)
is an API container, these vars would prevent Ironic inspector
requirements being accounted for, and as such no matching
constraints will be generated.

When the venv is deployed to the Ironic inspector container,
the lack of constraints can cause dependencies which are too new
to be installed, causing the service to fail.

Alternatively this role could be called twice by the playbook
for differing container/host roles, but as inspector is expected
to be merged into ironic at some point this feels equally valid.

There might be scenarios where a very old backup, created from a Cinder
snapshot, was not handled correctly by my previous patch.

This new patch addresses this corner case by adding a fallback
mechanism.

In Cinder, the base name of the backup volume is generated based either
on the volume id alone or a combination of the volume id and backup id.
Two different scenarios are considered here, each corresponding to a
different base name format:

(1)
If the backup was made from a volume snapshot, the older base name
format is used: volume-<vol-uuid>.backup.base.

(2)
If the backup wasn't made from a snapshot, a newer base name format is
used: volume-<vol-uuid>.backup-<backup-uuid>.

In both cases, the function attempts to restore the volume from a backup
image by looking for it under the base name. If the image is not found
(i.e., rbd.ImageNotFound), an error message is logged, and then the
function attempts to retrieve the backup volume under the alternative
base name. This is done because it's possible that the backup volume was
created using a different format than the one initially tried.

In other words, the check for another base name serves as a fallback
mechanism, which is used when the backup image is not found under the
expected name. The primary reason behind having two different base name
formats is likely due to a change in the naming convention at some point
in the history of the Cinder project. This approach ensures backward

of configuring journald using OSA. While this might be
neat for production deployments, it's very valuable to have for CI

before the migration is done (in other words, the parent port

The mcast_flood_reports option was being enabled on LSPs as a workaround
for a problem in core OVN. The issue in core OVN has been fixed and this
workaround is now causing an increase in the number of actions on the
table 38 of OVN (at the risk of hitting a size limit).

This patch disables the mcast_flood_reports option on newer versions of
OVN while keeping the backward compatibility with the old ones.

Since the fix in core OVN does not expose any information to the CMS to
tell us that the issue is fixed this patch uses the NB DB schema version
to determine if this is an old or a new OVN version.

in [1] a lock was introduced with the goal of preventing subnets from
being deleted while ports are being created in them in parallel.
This was acheived by aquiring an exclusive lock on the row of the
subnet in the Subnet table when adding/modifying a port or deleting
the subnet.

However as this was a exclusive lock it also prevented concurrent port
modifications on the same subnet from happening. This can cause
performance issues on environment with large shared subnets (e.g. a
large external subnet).

To reduce the lock contention for this case we split the lock in two
parts:

* For normal port operations we will aquire a shared lock on the
  row of the subnet. This allows multiple such operations to happen in
  parallel.
* For deleting a subnet we will aquire an exclusive lock on the row of
  the subnet. This lock can not be aquired when there is any shared
  lock currently on the row.

With this we maintain the same locking level as before, but reduce the
amount of lock contention happening and thereby improve throughput.

HINT: This isn't a clean backport, as we keep the subnet in-use field.
We can't backport the db update that would remove the field.

The performance improvement can be measured using rally test [2].
(improving from 21 to 18 seconds).
Alternatively it can be tested using 250 parallel curl calls to create a
port in the same network. This improves from 113s to 42s.

Resolve the following RemovedIn20Warning warnings:

  The MetaData.bind argument is deprecated and will be removed in
  SQLAlchemy 2.0.

  The ``bind`` argument for schema methods that invoke SQL against an
  engine or connection will be required in SQLAlchemy 2.0.

We are also able to resolve the following RemovedIn20Warning warning,
since the migration away from the bind parameter requires updating these
calls.

  The autoload parameter is deprecated and will be removed in version
  2.0.  Please use the autoload_with parameter, passing an engine or
  connection.

Similarly, we can also resolve the following RemovedIn20Warning warning,
since the calls we're updating here are the only ones affected by this
deprecation:

  The insert.values parameter will be removed in SQLAlchemy 2.0.  Please
  refer to the Insert.values() method.

After evacuations and revert resizes when using rbd storage backend,
the instance folder is usually left behind and causes issues when
migrating the instance back to the host.
With the config option set, the nova-compute service will cleanup
those folders as part of the periodic checks that run for instances
that have been evacuated/migrated.
