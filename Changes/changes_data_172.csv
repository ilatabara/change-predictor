This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ====================================================== Flavour and Image defined ephemeral storage encryption ====================================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/ephemeral-storage-encryption This spec outlines a new approach to ephemeral storage encryption in Nova allowing users to select how their ephemeral storage is encrypted at rest through the use of flavors with specific extra specs or images with specific properties. The aim being to bring the ephemeral storage encryption experience within Nova in line with the block storage encryption implementation provided by Cinder where user selectable `encrypted volume types`_ are available. Note that this spec will only cover the high level changes to the API and compute layers, implementation within specific virt drivers is left for separate specs. Problem description =================== At present the only in-tree ephemeral storage encryption support is provided by the libvirt virt driver when using the lvm imagebackend. The current implementation provides basic operator controlled and configured host specific support for ephemeral disk encryption at rest where all instances on a given compute are forced to use encrypted ephemeral storage using the dm-crypt ``PLAIN`` encryption format. This is not ideal and makes ephemeral storage encryption completely opaque to the end user as opposed to the block storage encryption support provided by Cinder where users are able to opt-in to using admin defined encrypted volume types to ensure their storage is encrypted at rest. Additionally the current implementation uses a single symmetric key to encrypt all ephemeral storage associated with the instance. As the ``PLAIN`` encryption format is used there is no way to rotate this key in-place. Use Cases --------- * As a user I want to request that all of my ephemeral storage is encrypted at rest through the selection of a specific flavor or image. * As a user I want to be able to pick how my ephemeral storage is encrypted at rest through the selection of a specific flavor or image. * As an admin/operator I want to either enforce ephemeral encryption per flavor or per image. * As an admin/operator I want to provide sane choices to my end users regarding how their ephemeral storage is encrypted at rest. * As a virt driver maintainer/developer I want to indicate that my driver supports ephemeral storage encryption using a specific encryption format. * As a virt driver maintainer/developer I want to provide sane default encryption format and options for users looking to encrypt their ephemeral storage at rest. I want these associated with the encrypted storage until it is deleted. Proposed change =============== To enable this new flavor extra specs, image properties and host configurables will be introduced. These will control when and how ephemeral storage encryption at rest is enabled for an instance. .. note:: The following ``hw_ephemeral_encryption`` image properties do not relate to if an image is encrypted at rest within the Glance service. They only relate to how ephemeral storage will be encrypted at rest when used by a provisioned instance within Nova. Separate image properties have been documented in the `Glance image encryption`_ and `Cinder image encryption`_ specs to cover how images can be encrypted at rest within Glance. Allow ephemeral encryption to be configured by flavor, image or config ---------------------------------------------------------------------- To enable ephemeral encryption per instance the following boolean based flavor extra spec and image property will be introduced: * ``hw:ephemeral_encryption`` * ``hw_ephemeral_encryption`` The above will enable ephemeral storage encryption for an instance but does not control the encryption format used or the associated options. For this the following flavor extra specs, image properties and configurables will be introduced. The encryption format used will be controlled by the following flavor extra specs and image properties: * ``hw:ephemeral_encryption_format`` * ``hw_ephemeral_encryption_format`` When neither of the above are provided but ephemeral encryption is still requested an additional host configurable will be used to provide a default format per compute, this will initially default to ``luks``: * ``[ephemeral_storage_encryption]/default_format`` This could lead to requests against different clouds resulting in a different ephemeral encryption format being used but as this is transparent to the end user from within the instance it shouldn't have any real impact. The format will be provided as a string that maps to a ``BlockDeviceEncryptionFormatTypeField`` oslo.versionedobjects field value: * ``plain`` for the plain dm-crypt format * ``luks`` for the LUKSv1 format BlockDeviceMapping changes -------------------------- The ``BlockDeviceMapping`` object will be extended to include the following fields encapsulating some of the above information per ephemeral disk within the instance: ``encrypted`` A simple boolean to indicate if the block device is encrypted. This will initially only be populated when ephemeral encryption is used but could easily be used for encrypted volumes as well in the future. ``encryption_secret_uuid`` As the name suggests this will contain the UUID of the associated encryption secret for the disk. The type of secret used here will be specific to the encryption format and virt driver used, it should not be assumed that this will always been an symmetric key as is currently the case with all encrypted volumes provided by Cinder. For example, for ``luks`` based ephemeral storage this secret will be a ``passphrase``. ``encryption_format`` A new ``BlockDeviceEncryptionFormatType`` enum and associated ``BlockDeviceEncryptionFormatTypeField`` field listing the encryption format. The available options being kept in line with the constants currently provided by os-brick and potentially merged in the future if both can share these types and fields somehow. ``encryption_options`` A simple unversioned dict of strings containing encryption options specific to the virt driver implementation, underlying hypervisor and format being used. Populate ephemeral encryption BlockDeviceMapping attributes during build ------------------------------------------------------------------------- When launching an instance with ephemeral encryption requested via either the image or flavor the ``BlockDeviceMapping.encrypted`` attribute will be set to ``True`` for each ``BlockDeviceMapping`` record with a ``destination_type`` value of ``local``. This will happen after the original API BDM dicts have been transformed into objects within the Compute API but before scheduling the instance(s). The ``encryption_format`` attribute will also take its' value from the image or flavor if provided. Any differences or conflicts between the image and flavor for this will raise a ``409 Conflict`` error being raised by the API. Use ``COMPUTE_EPHEMERAL_ENCRYPTION`` compatibility traits --------------------------------------------------------- A ``COMPUTE_EPHEMERAL_ENCRYPTION`` compute compatibility traits was introduced during `Wallaby`__ and will be reported by virt drivers to indicate overall support for ephemeral storage encryption using this new approach. This trait will always be used by pre-filter outlined in the following section when ephemeral encryption has been requested, regardless of any format being specified in the request, allowing the compute that eventually handles the request to select a format it supports using the ``[ephemeral_storage_encryption]/default_format`` configurable. ``COMPUTE_EPHEMERAL_ENCRYPTION_$FORMAT`` compute compatibility traits were also added to os-traits during `Wallaby`__ and will be reported by virt drivers to indicate support for specific ephemeral storage encryption formats. For example: .. __: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/os-traits/+/759878 * ``COMPUTE_EPHEMERAL_ENCRYPTION_LUKS`` * ``COMPUTE_EPHEMERAL_ENCRYPTION_LUKSV2`` * ``COMPUTE_EPHEMERAL_ENCRYPTION_PLAIN`` These traits will only be used alongside the ``COMPUTE_EPHEMERAL_ENCRYPTION`` trait when the ``hw_ephemeral_encryption_format`` image property or ``hw:ephemeral_encryption_format`` extra spec have been provided in the initial request. Introduce an ephemeral encryption request pre-filter ---------------------------------------------------- A new pre-filter will be introduced that adds the above traits as required to the request spec when the aforementioned image properties or flavor extra specs are provided. As outlined above this will always include the ``COMPUTE_EPHEMERAL_ENCRYPTION`` trait when ephemeral encryption has been requested and may optionally include one of the format specific traits if a format is included in the request. Expose ephemeral encryption attributes via block_device_info ------------------------------------------------------------ Once the ``BlockDeviceMapping`` objects have been updated and the instance scheduled to a compute the objects are transformed once again into a ``block_device_info`` dict understood by the virt layer that at present contains the following: ``root_device_name`` The root device path used by the instance. ``ephemerals`` A list of ``DriverEphemeralBlockDevice`` dict objects detailing the ephemeral disks attached to the instance. Note this does not include the initial image based disk used by the instance that is classified as an ephemeral disk in terms of the ephemeral encryption feature. ``block_device_mapping`` A list of ``DriverVol*BlockDevice`` dict objects detailing the volume based disks attached to the instance. ``swap`` An optional ``DriverSwapBlockDevice`` dict object detailing the swap device. For example: .. code-block:: json { ""root_device_name"": ""/dev/vda"", ""ephemerals"": [ { ""guest_format"": null, ""device_name"": ""/dev/vdb"", ""device_type"": ""disk"", ""size"": 1, ""disk_bus"": ""virtio"" } ], ""block_device_mapping"": [], ""swap"": { ""swap_size"": 1, ""device_name"": ""/dev/vdc"", ""disk_bus"": ""virtio"" } } As noted above ``block_device_info`` does not provide a complete overview of the storage associated with an instance. In order for it to be useful in the context of ephemeral storage encryption we would need to extend the dict to always include information relating to local image based disks. As such a new ``DriverImageBlockDevice`` dict class will be introduced covering image based block devices and provided to the virt layer via an additional ``image`` key within the ``block_device_info`` dict when the instance uses such a disk. As with the other ``Driver*BlockDevice`` dict classes this will proxy access to the underlying ``BlockDeviceMapping`` object allowing the virt layer to lookup the previously listed ``encrypted`` and ``encryption_*`` attributes. While outside the scope of this spec the above highlights a huge amount of complexity and technical debt still residing in the codebase around how storage configurations are handled between the different layers. In the long term we should plan to remove ``block_device_info`` and replace it with direct access to ``BlockDeviceMapping`` based objects ensuring the entire configuration is always exposed to the virt layer. Report that a disk is encrypted at rest through the metadata API ---------------------------------------------------------------- Extend the metadata API so that users can confirm that their ephemeral storage is encrypted at rest through the metadata API, accessible from within their instance. .. code-block:: json { ""devices"": [ { ""type"": ""nic"", ""bus"": ""pci"", ""address"": ""0000:00:02.0"", ""mac"": ""00:11:22:33:44:55"", ""tags"": [""trusted""] }, { ""type"": ""disk"", ""bus"": ""virtio"", ""address"": ""0:0"", ""serial"": ""12352423"", ""path"": ""/dev/vda"", ""encrypted"": ""True"" }, { ""type"": ""disk"", ""bus"": ""ide"", ""address"": ""0:0"", ""serial"": ""disk-vol-2352423"", ""path"": ""/dev/sda"", ""tags"": [""baz""] } ] } This should also be extended to cover disks provided by encrypted volumes but this is obviously out of scope for this implementation. Block resize between flavors with different hw:ephemeral_encryption settings ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ephemeral data is expected to persist through a resize and as such any resize between flavors that differed in their configuration of ephemeral encryption (one enabled, another disabled or formats etc) would cause us to convert this data in place. This isn't trivial and so for this initial implementation resizing between flavors that differ will be blocked. Provide a migration path from the legacy implementation ------------------------------------------------------- New ``nova-manage`` and ``nova-status`` commands will be introduced to migrate any instances using the legacy libvirt virt driver implementation ahead of the removal of this in a future release. The ``nova-manage`` command will ensure that any existing instances with ``ephemeral_key_uuid`` set will have their associated ``BlockDeviceMapping`` records updated to reference said secret key, the ``plain`` encryption format and configured options on the host before clearing ``ephemeral_key_uuid``. Additionally the libvirt virt driver will also attempt to migrate instances with ``ephemeral_key_uuid`` set during spawn. This should allow at least some of the instances to be moved during the W release ahead of X. The ``nova-status`` command will simply report on the existence of any instances with ``ephemeral_key_uuid`` set that do not have the corresponding ``BlockDeviceMapping`` attributes enabled etc. Deprecate the now legacy implementation --------------------------------------- The legacy implementation within the libvirt virt driver will be deprecated for removal in a future release once the ability to migrate is in place. Alternatives ------------ Continue to use the transparent host configurables and expand support to other encryption formats such as ``LUKS``. Data model impact ----------------- See above for the various flavor extra spec, image property, ``BlockDeviceMapping`` and ``DriverBlockDevice`` object changes. REST API impact --------------- * Flavor extra specs and image property validation will be introduced for the any ephemeral encryption provided options. * Attempts to resize between flavors that differ in their ephemeral encryption options will be rejected. * Attempts to rebuild between images that differ in their ephemeral encryption options will be allowed. * The metadata API will be changed to allow users to determine if their ephemeral storage is encrypted as discussed above. Security impact --------------- This should hopefully be positive given the unique secret per disk and user visible choice regarding how their ephemeral storage is encrypted at rest. Additionally this should allow additional virt drivers to support ephemeral storage encryption while also allowing the libvirt virt driver to increase coverage of the feature across more imagebackends such as qcow2 and rbd. Notifications impact -------------------- N/A Other end user impact --------------------- Users will now need to opt-in to ephemeral storage encryption being used by their instances through their choice of image or flavors. Performance Impact ------------------ The additional pre-filter will add a small amount of overhead when scheduling instances but this should fail fast if ephemeral encryption is not requested through the image or flavor. The performance impact of increased use of ephemeral storage encryption by instances is left to be discussed in the virt driver specific specs as this will vary between hypervisors. Other deployer impact --------------------- N/A Developer impact ---------------- Virt driver developers will be able to indicate support for specific ephemeral storage encryption formats using the newly introduced compute compatibility traits. Upgrade impact -------------- The compute traits should ensure that requests to schedule instances using ephemeral storage encryption with mixed computes (N-1 and N) will work during a rolling upgrade. As discussed earlier in the spec future upgrades will need to provide a path for existing ephemeral storage encryption users to migrate from the legacy implementation. This should be trivial but may require an additional grenade based job in CI during the W cycle to prove out the migration path. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: lyarwood Other contributors: Feature Liaison --------------- Feature liaison: lyarwood Work Items ---------- * Introduce ``hw_ephemeral_encryption*`` image properties and ``hw:ephemeral_encryption`` flavor extra specs. * Introduce a new ``encrypted``. ``encryption_secret_uuid``, ``encryption_format`` and ``encryption_options`` attributes to the BlockDeviceMapping Object. * Wire up the new ``BlockDeviceMapping`` object attributes through the ``Driver*BlockDevice`` layer and ``block_device_info`` dict. * Report ephemeral storage encryption through the metadata API. * Introduce new ``nova-manage`` and ``nova-status`` commands to allow existing users to migrate to this new implementation. This should however be blocked outside of testing until a virt driver implementation is landed. * Validate all of the above in functional tests ahead of any virt driver implementation landing. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= At present without a virt driver implementation this will be tested entirely within our unit and functional test suites. Once a virt driver implementation is available additional integration tests in Tempest and whitebox tests can be written. Testing of the migration path from the legacy implementation will require an additional grenade job but this will require the libvirt virt driver implementation to be completed first. Documentation Impact ==================== * The new host configurables, flavor extra specs and image properties should be documented. * New user documentation should be written covering the overall use of the feature from a Nova point of view. * Reference documentation around `BlockDeviceMapping` objects etc should be updated to make note of the new encryption attributes.

devstack unit test job does not set any nodeset
and so does use default nodeset defined in base jobs
in opendev. When opendev switches the default nodeset to
the latest distro version, devstack unit test job can start

Adds a horribly written, just hacked together little tool to help
provide sizing insight into an ironic deployment's state and underlying
performance.

Key data:
* Queries the list of node from a pure python interface level with the
  database and reports timeing for the list of nodes to be returned.
  This information helps convey how long a periodic hits the database
  just for the query.
* Requests *all* nodes using the query pattern/structure of the nova
  resource tracker, and uses the marker to make any additional requsts.
  The data is parsed, and collected, and counts identified vendors,
  if any.
* Collects basic data on conductors in terms of running, conductor groups
  as well as currently loaded drivers in the deployment.

All of this information provides operational insight into *what*
conditions exist within the deployment allowing developers to try
and identify solutions based on the unique circumstances of larger
deployments.

Also adds a utility to generate and semi-randomize data to allow us to
create a benchmark job in CI.

Additionally, this project plans to use machine learning algorithms to quickly locate failures and root causes, to improve operation and maintenance efficiency. TODO Sign up(deadline March 25th): next PTL's task because ""Who will be moderating their discussions?"" is one of the question of the survey https://openinfrafoundation.formstack.com/forms/april2021_vptg_survey https://ethercalc.net/oz7q0gds9zfi Topics: Background It’s difficult to retrieve logs, since there are many modules in the platform, e.g. systems service, compute, storage, network and other platform services. Because of distributed and interaction between components of the cloud platform, and scattered logs between components, it will take more time to locate problems. Current function Provide a simple and easy-to-use way to retrieve all log and the context . Realize log association, field value statistics, and provide multi-scene and multi-dimensional visual analysis reports. Current progress Develop devstack-based depAdd log retrieval of other modules such as vitrage loyment for venus Develop the configuration, based on which you can retrieve the chain log of the call Next step Develop alarm task code to set threshold for the number of error logs of different modules at different times, and provides alarm services and notification services The configuration, analysis and alarm of Venus will be integrated into horizon in the form of plugin. Develop a deployment method based on kolla-ansible Evaluate whether to collect event data (considering usage, pressure, etc.) Summarize the log specifications of some typical scenarios and develop them to venus promblem Many projects's log records are not standardized, so they can only support full-text retrieval, not multi-dimensional analysis ",,47,0

When setting rows_per_shard to 'auto', the new default, the sharder will
adjust the last 2 shard_ranges to make sure the last shards isn't too
small. It does this by making broker's _get_next_shard_range_upper smarter

Currently when we ask a container broker to give us the next shard range
upper if just reads the next `shard_size` objects from the last and
either return it or if it's beyond return None.

But this can lead to tiny shard ranges at the end of a sharding
container. It would be better to read ahead an extra range and adjust
accordingly. To make this happen the broker's find_shard_ranges has
grown a correct_tail flag, that when set:
 - Get the next upper (first_upper). If this is none return it as we're at
   the end.
 - Get the second upper. If this exists then we can just return the
   first.
 - If there isn't a second upper we need to get how many objs are left
   and:
  ~ if the objs left < some value. Lump the rest of the objects in the
    same shard, that is return None as we're at the end.
  - If the objs left > some value. Find a new next upper that'll make 2
    better sized shards:

  return next_upper(last_upper, (shard_size + objs_left) // 2)

Currently, by default, kuryr-kubernetes services (controller and CNI
daemon) are suppose to be run as a systemd services. The reality is,
that in most real world deployments we are using containerized services.
In this patch variable KURYR_K8S_CONTAINERIZED_DEPLOYMENT will now have
default value set to True, which means, that without even setting it,
deploying kuryr-kubernetes will be containerized.

Secondly, we agreed[1], that all the gate names should also reflect that
change in their names.

And finally, non working and outdated local.conf samples for
OpenDaylight has to be removed.

Behaviour for sample local.confs wasn't change: using them to spin up
devstack will still use systemd services.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =============================== Configurable Instance Hostnames =============================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/configurable-instance-hostnames Allow users to specify an explicit hostname for their instance when creating instances. Problem description =================== Nova publishes hostnames for instances via the metadata service and config drives. This hostname is based on a sanitized version of the instance display name combined with the domain value specified in ``[api] dhcp_domain``. As part of the discussion around `bug 1581977`__, it was noted that there is currently no way to explicitly specify a hostname and decouple it from the display name. We use the instance's hostname when `DNS integration is enabled in neutron`__, and this can result in a lack of control over hostnames, preventing users doing reasonable things like naming their instances based on the fully-qualified domain name that the instance will eventually be available at. Correct this gap by allowing users to specify an explicit hostname when creating instances. __ https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1581977 __ https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/victoria/admin/config-dns-int.html Use Cases --------- As a user, I wish to specify an explicit hostname rather than relying on a (poorly) sanitized version of the display name. Proposed change =============== Allow users to pass an additional ``hostname`` field when creating new server(s) (``POST /servers``) and when updating an existing server (``PUT /servers/{id}``). This ``hostname`` attribute will have the following constraints: - It must be 63 characters or less - It must consist of alphanumeric characters and dashes (``-``). Periods, underscores, and other characters outside this set will be rejected - It cannot end in a dash Where multiple instances are requested, hostnames will be suffixed with ``-{idx}``, where ``{idx}`` is a 1-based index. If the combined name and suffix would exceed the 63 character limit, the name will be rejected. The ``OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:hostname`` instance attribute, which is currently admin-only, will now be shown for non-admin users, since it doesn't make sense to allow users to configure the value but not see it. Alternatives ------------ - Remove support for neutron's DNS integration features and require users explicitly create and configure ports with the ``dns_name`` attribute before creating the instance. This places extra work on nova and will result in a worse user experience. - Forbid creation of multiple instances when the ``hostname`` attribute is provided, similar to how we forbid this when a port is provided. This is reasonable but will require a little more effort from users. - Start rejecting instance names that are not valid hostnames. This is a significant breaking change that will impact many users. Data model impact ----------------- None. The ``Instance`` object and corresponding database model and table already have a ``hostname`` field/column. REST API impact --------------- A new microversion will be introduced. When this microversion is used, users will be able to pass an additional ``hostname`` field when creating new server(s) (``POST /servers``) and when updating an existing server (``PUT /servers/{id}``). This ``hostname`` attribute will have the following constraints: - It must be 63 characters or less - It must consist of alphanumeric characters and dashes (``-``). Periods, underscores, and other characters outside this set will be rejected - It cannot end in a dash Where multiple instances are requested, hostnames will be suffixed with ``-{idx}``, where ``{idx}`` is a 1-based index. If the combined name and suffix would exceed the 63 character limit, the name will be rejected. When updating the hostname of an existing instance, the ``dns_name`` attribute of the port(s) in neutron will be updated, as will the ``hostname`` attribute exposed via the metadata service. The ``OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:hostname`` instance attribute, which is currently admin-only, will now be accessible by non-admin users. Security impact --------------- None. Hostnames will be validated by both the nova API and neutron to prevent invalid hostnames. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- The neutron documentation will need to be updated to reflect the changes in behavior. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- None. Upgrade impact -------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: stephenfinucane Other contributors: None Feature Liaison --------------- Feature liaison: stephenfinucane Work Items ---------- - Make necessary changes to nova - Update neutron documentation Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= This can be tested via Tempest tests, though this will likely require the `designate-tempest-plugin`__ package. The bulk of the lifting will be done with functional and unit tests. __ https://github.com/openstack/designate-tempest-plugin Documentation Impact ==================== Both nova and neutron's documentation will need to be updated to reference this functionality. The api-ref will be updated to document the new fields allowed in the API requests.

Store the 'name_upper' of the networks in the
network name id map, and use this name when
setting the port name in port definitions.

The port name is checked agains existing ports,
and since THT uses the upper case network name
when setting the port name the same (name_upper)
must be used here.

When ceph_nfs_rados_backend is provided, as per doc [1], for a fresh
setup, we need to make sure to create the Ganesha export index object
as an empty object before starting the Ganesha server.
This change provides the two tasks, already present in ceph-ansible,
to create the index object.
In addition, since the ganesha systemd units are managed by pacemaker,
this change renders the related j2 templates and prepares the ganesha
workdir in the ceph-nfs target hosts.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Support server join/leave server group ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/join-leave-server-group Server groups are used to help users place the instances in this group on the same host (affinity) or on different hosts (anti-affinity). But instances can only be added to server groups when it is creating. Once successfully created, the server group of instances cannot be modified. This spec allows users to add instance to server group or remove instance from server group after the instance is created. Problem description =================== Currently, users can only add instance to the server group when creating an instance. Once the instance is created, the server group of the instance cannot be modified. Use Cases --------- As an end user, I would like to add the instance which is already created to a server group. Or I would like to delete the instance from server group but do not delete the instance. Proposed change =============== Introduce two server actions (``POST /servers/{id}/action``) ``joinServerGroup`` which allows user to add instance to server group and ``leaveServerGroup`` which allows user to delete instance from server group. Add new policies for two actions. Allow Administrators or owner to call ``joinServerGroup`` or ``leaveServerGroup`` for instance. When adding an instance to a server group we: * (api) validate the status of the instance and check if instance already in a server group. Note, each instance can only be in one server group at most. * (api) update instance_group in ``request_spec`` and scheduler_hint. we also add the instance uuid to the members of ``InstanceGroup``. * (conductor) call ``resize_instance`` to perform cold migration of the instance. Cold migration make the instance to follow the policy of server group. Similarly, when removing an instance from a server group we: * (api) validate the status of the instance and check if instance already in a server group. * (api) remove instance_group from ``request_spec`` and scheduler_hint. we also remove the instance uuid from the members of ``InstanceGroup``. Add ``instance.host`` to ``ignore_host``. * (conductor) call ``resize_instance`` to perform cold migration of the instance. In addition, we need to change the ``ServerGroupAntiAffinityFilter`` in scheduler. Because this filter always return true for the host of instance, which does not meet the scenario of join server group. Alternatives ------------ We can delete the instance from server group by delete the instance or server group. We can also recreate an instance and add it to the server group. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- A new microversion increment will be needed in order to add the implementation for ``joinServerGroup`` and ``leaveServerGroup``. In order to use this feature, users will have have to make this request to the nova API:: POST /servers/<id>/action Body:: joinServerGroup: { ""joinServerGroup"": { ""uuid"": ""{server_group_id}"" } } leaveServerGroup { ""leaveServerGroup"": { } } If join/remove server group is not applicable because of the restrictions defined above, an exception will be raised and a HTTP response with status code 400 (Bad Request) will be returned. Otherwise, a HTTP response with status code 202 (Accepted) will be returned. Security impact --------------- The ``os_compute_api:servers:join_server_group`` and ``os_compute_api:servers:leave_server_group`` policy rule will by default be admin or owner. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- python-openstackclient: Join/remove server group feature will be used as such:: openstack server join server group <server> <server_group> openstack server leave server group <server> This blueprint will impact python-openstackclient (adding the join/remove server group command). Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- The operators are able to control the live-resize functions through the ``os_compute_api:servers:join_server_group`` and ``os_compute_api:servers:leave_server_group`` policy in the ``policy.json`` file. Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: xyuwang <wangxinyu@inspur.com> Other contributors: fangwenjiang <jiangfw@inspur.com> Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= Unit tests, functional API tests. Tempest test for the new nova API will be added. CI testing will be performed by the Third Party CIs. Documentation Impact ==================== The End User Guide will need to be updated to introduce these two api.

Problem description =================== 'network_data.json' in ConfigDriveDatasource contains port group information which provides ports with bond functionality. When an instance starts, cloud-init will use these data to configure ports automatically. However, when using OpenstackDatasource, 'network_data.json' dose not contain port group information. After starting, ironic instance which set up with bond functionality with multiple network cards will not able to configure network ports correctly. Use Cases --------- Bare metal machine that supports bond functionality with multiple network cards, which is configured to use the OpenStack data source provided by Nova-API-Metadata service to obtain network configuration information. Proposed change =============== Changes on nova-api-metadata service. For ironic server instance that supports bond functionality with multiple network cards, metadata service has to provide port group information. One API is involved -- ""http://169.254.169.254/openstack/latest/network_data.json"". - 1. Add a function to tell whether a instance is an ironic instance based on flavor and instance.node. 1) The basic step is to check flavor. Find in the extra_specs of flavor, checking whether the keys exists that starts with ""resources:CUSTOM_"". If exists, then the instance may be an ironic instance. 2) After passing the basic checking, we need to get all compute_nodes through cell_mappings. Search nodes that hypervisor_hostname or uuid equals instance.node. Check whether the queried instance's hypervisor type is 'ironic'. - 2. Add a function to generate ironic instance network metadata, which comes from the original network metadata and port group information. This function receives node_uuid and the original network metadata. It uses ironicclient to call node.list_ports and portgroup.list. Afterwards, combine network metadata with ports and portgroup to generate the new network metadata with bond information. - 3. In nova/api/metadata/base.py:__init__ function before generating network metadata, we need to do some modification for ironic instance. * First, call the function referred in (1) to tell whether the instance is an ironic instance. If true, load the IronicClientWrapper. If fails, it means ironicclient is not installed. * If ironicclient exits, call the function referred in (2) to generate the new network metadata with bond information.

Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ For most scenarios, a server instance is not typically an ironic instance, so the main performance factor is the ability to quickly determine if a server is an ironic instance. Using extra_specs information in instance.flavor can quickly filter out most of the instance that are not ironic instances with little performance impact. In the further judgment of ironic instances, there will be reading table of cell_mappings and compute_node in every cell in the worst case. Generally, the number of cells is small. In The worst, value of database read operand is the number of cell_mappings + 1, which has a little impact on performance. Finally, when it comes to generate portGroup data for an ironic instance, loading a client module and making two calls will have a performance impact and take a long time relatively.

Hyper-V, KVM, PowerVM and VMWare allows users to resize both memory
and local disks of the VMs while they are still running. Because
of this, no down time is needed for the spawned instances when
live resize is performed on the same host.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Hyper-V: Instance hot resize ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/hyper-v-hot-resize In Windows Hyper-V / Server 2012 R2 a new feature was introduced, allowing users to resize the VMs while they are still running. Because of this, no down time for the spawned instances is necessary when performing nova resize. Problem description =================== The main disadvantage for resizing an instance is the required down time necessary to do so. This spec will allow users to resize their Hyper-V instances without having to stop them first. Use Cases ---------- There are 2 use cases, depending on what OS the nova-compute service is running: * Windows Hyper-V / Server 2012 R2: only the virtual hard disk hot resize is supported. This means that this feature is only appliable if the new target flavor requires only a bigger disk. Cold resize will be performed in any other cases. For more details, check the source [1]. * Windows Hyper-V / Server 10 Technical Preview or newer: only virtual hard disk and memory hot resize are supported. Cold resize will be performed if the flavor requires a different number of vCPUs. For more details, check the source [2]. There are a few restrictions that apply to this feature, as mentioned in [1]: * The disk format must be VHDX. * The disk to be resized must be attached to a SCSI controller. * The resize must occur on the same host. Project Priority ----------------- None Proposed change =============== There are a few changes that needs to be applied to the Hyper-V driver in order to support this feature: * Attach the virtual hard disks to the SCSI controller instead of the IDE controller. * Add virtual hard disk online resize support to a subclass of VHDUtilsV2, which will be used in Windows Hyper-V / Server 2012 R2 or newer. * Add support for memory resize in a subclass of VMUtilsV2, which will be used in Windows Hyper-V / Server 10 Technical Preview or newer. * Add the appropriate changes to utilsfactory to accommodate the new utils classes mentioned above. Since hot resize can only occur if the host stays the same, we must check that it is truly the case and the new flavor is appropriate for a hot resize. Cold resize is to be applied otherwise, meaning there would be no change in functionality. If a hot resize is appropriate, during resize, the Hyper-V driver must: * migrate_disk_and_power_off: *Avoid stoping and destroying the instance. * finish_migration: * Avoid creating another ephemeral disk. * Avoid creating a new instance and attaching a config drive to it, since it was never destroyed. * Avoid starting the instance, since it was never stoped. * Perform hot resize. * finish_revert_migration: * Avoid creating a new instance and attaching a config drive to it, since it was never destroyed. * Avoid starting the instance, since it was never stoped. If hot resize is appropriate, the following changes to ComputeManager's resize_instance method should be considered: * It should not terminate the connection for any of the instance's volumes, since they are still in use and the instance can actively use them. * Since the resize occurs on the same host, avoid calling finish_resize through compute_rpcapi and call the method locally. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None, the user will use the same command as before. Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- To use this feature, the users will have to enable it from the compute node's nova.conf, setting the config option hyperv.allow_live_resize‏ to True. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: <cbelu@cloudbasesolutions.com> Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Dependencies ============ * Windows Hyper-V / Server 2012 R2 (hot resize - disk only) * Windows Hyper-V / Server 10 Technical Preview (hot resize - disk + memory) Testing ======= This feature should have the unit tests related to the any changes. CI testing will be performed by Hyper-V CI. Documentation Impact ==================== The possibility to perform hot resize on Hyper-V instances will be documented, as well as the config option for Hyper-V.

And which will prevent the user to attach another volume when the previous volume not attaching completely. Problem description =================== If the user want to attach volumes continuously, there will be a problem when the first volume attached too slowly. Because if the first volume attached too slowly, and at the same time attaching another volume, the nova-api will send the RPC call message to nova-cpu, however the attach_volume function in manager.py[1] is taking an instance.uuid lock for the first volume, and reserve_block_device_name function in manager.py[1] will wait the first volume attached completed to take the instance.uuid lock to create block_device_mapping. And if storage backend is dealt with attaching slowly, the RPC call in nova-api will be timeout. The nova-cpu does not know the nova-api has excepted caused by timeout, and still to create block_device_mapping after the first volume attached completely. And the database will has a record for the second volume, though the volume is not attached to this instance. Use Cases --------- As an operator, I wants to attach more than one volumes, it will be useful to avoid errors during attaching volumes. Proposed change =============== Define ATTACHING and DETACHING in fields.py and task_state.py Check the task state is none or not, if the task state is not none, there will be not allowed to attach and detach the volume and return the HTTP conflict. Save ATTACHING to the task state before creating block_device_mapping and save the task state to none when exception occurs in _attach_volume function in nova-api. Save the DETACHING to the task state and save the task state to none when exception occurs in detach_volume function in nova-api. Save the task state to None when the attaching process is over in nova-cpu. and call the decorator function when the exception is raised. Save the task state to None when the detaching process is over in nova-cpu. and call the decorator function when the exception is raised. Code implementation can be found in [2] [3] Alternatives ------------ We could always create the bdm in the nova-api and update the device once attached on the compute. This is a good method to avoid the problem as the above mentioned, but this method cannot guarantee to get the right device name very well.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =========================================================== Nova support multiple boot volume with boot order selection =========================================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/nova-support-multiple-boot-volume-with-boot-order-selection This feature aims at providing the ability to change boot order of a instance virtualized by qemu with multiple bootable volumes. End user can bind several volumes to an instance and choose a different volume to boot the instance when necessary. The changes take effect and reboot immediately if ""reboot"" optional set to ""true"" or after hard rebooting manually. Problem description =================== QEMU has supported for boot index but this feature is not included in nova now. Although block device mapping has recorded the boot index information, it is not used adequately. Now, an implementation for boot order selection will provide a easy way to boot an instance with several volumes. Use Cases --------- End user can change a different volume to boot the instance, which is like changing operating system in a vm. This feature can be used to help to rescue system with a backup system volume or else. Also end user can choose to start a Windows OS server, then switch to Linux OS after attaching a linux bootable volume to server. Proposed change =============== * RESTful API for changing and querying boot order will be added to nova-api. Save the new boot index information to databases, and update server's root device and root device size. If user set the reboot option to true, then a hard rebooting invoking will be made. * Changes will be patched to nova-compute when generating guest xml. Multiple boot support will be used when os boot device is 'hd', and this os element will be removed. Afterwards, boot order information will be written into the guest's config based on guest's block device information. Then the server will boot from the volume as arranged. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- Two API methods are added: Update volume boot order API and Query volume boot order API: * URL: /servers/{server_id}/volume-boot-order Update volume boot order API, and Query volume boot order API * Method type: * PUT(Update volume boot order) * GET( Query volume boot order) * Normal http response code(s): 202 for update, 200 for query * Expected error http response code(s):400, 404, 409 * Error code explanation: * 400: The request body is not in valid format or block device information dose not match with instance. * 409: New flavor can not be created while root device size changed. * 404: Request server is not found * Request body for PUT method :: { ""server"": { ""block_device_mapping_v2"": [ { ""boot_index"": 1, ""uuid"": ""volume_id_1"" }, { ""boot_index"": 2, ""uuid"": ""volume_id_2"" } ], ""reboot"": true } } * The ""uuid"" is uuid of volume attached to the server, which id referred to block_device_mapping_v2_new_item schema. * The ""boot_index"" is a positive integer. * The ""reboot"" is optional, and the default value is false. If it is set true, server will hard reboot. * For GET method, body content is blank. Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- If ""reboot"" is set, hard reboot notification will be sent. Other end user impact --------------------- Aside from the API, python-novaclient can be patched to support this feature afterwards. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- The ""virt_type"" property is recommend to set kvm or qemu in the ""nova.conf"" to support this feature. Developer impact ---------------- If the feature is on, guest's xml definition will be a little different. ""boot order"" will be added to the disk element of devices, and ""boot dev"" will be removed from the ""os"" element if the original value is calculated as ""hd"". Newly attached volume's boot index will be 'None', which will be at the bottom of block mapping list. Therefore this won't have an impact on volume attachment or detachment. Upgrade impact -------------- The feature can be support support by libvirt since 0.1.3, per-device boot since 0.8.8. We tested on Rocky release, and the boot order can be successfully changed. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Jinsheng Zhang Other contributors: fangwen Feature Liaison --------------- Liaison Needed Work Items ---------- * nova-api: add ""update boot order"" and ""query boot order"" API. Check and save block device mappings, then call remote compute service to hard reboot the server. * nova-compute: reboot the server. Set boot order according to the block device mapping when generating guest's xml. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Add releated unit test. Documentation Impact ==================== * `API Guides` needs some updates in #Servers - run an action #, add volume boot order selection API. * `Configuration Reference` & `Deployment Guides` need some updates. When compute nodes is qemu as hypervisor, ""virt_type"" is recommended to set in controller node.

Given fast forward upgrades don't restart services until the last release, Nova needs to continue to support reshapes for old releases, like Stein. If we want to delete old reshapes upstream (and not checking the needed behaviours everytime we restart nova-compute), we need to provide a specific command (eg. a nova-manage) command that would verify and modify the Placement DB without needing to have the services to be up, ie. an offline tool per say. Problem description =================== Use Cases --------- * As a developer, I want to delete old reshape methods * As an operator, I just don't want to see the compute service to verify all the reshapes since Stein if I just have a simple upgrade. Proposed change =============== Since the `nova-manage` command directly queries the Nova databases without needing the services to be up, it's needed to use it from a host that can look at the DB. That said, since most of the reshape methods are used for virtual drivers like Libvirt, the command should also be run in the needed compute hosts. As we can't ask operators to make sure that compute hosts can query the Placement DB, we then need to provide two different commands : * one for querying the Placement DB directly * one for running in the compute host and checking the virt drvers The first one should be the main command for reshaping. It would use some file created by the second command and would ask the Placement API to reshape the needed allocations. The second command would be run in every compute host to get a new provider tree. The relationship between those two commands could be seen as very similar as the overall flow we have for `online reshapes`_ : * In the compute host, the operator would call ``nova-manage compute update_provider_tree``. If the return code is 1, then the related resource provider for the compute host would be needed to be reshaped. If it returns 0, no reshape is needed. * Then, the operator would run on a controller host ``nova-manage placement get_allocations <rp_uuid>`` to get all the allocations from the specific Resource Provider UUID that is actually the related compute host. * Then, back to the compute host, the operator would call ``nova-manage compute update_provider_tree <file>`` where <file> is the file provided by the previous call. It would then return the new provider tree. * Eventually, running on the controller host ``nova-manage placement reshape <file>`` where <file> would be what was returned would need call Placement API to ask to reshape. Some diagram could be better for understanding the workflow : .. seqdiag:: seqdiag { edge_length = 200; span_height = 15; activation = none; default_note_color = white; 'Compute host'; Controller; 'Compute host' -> 'Compute host' [label = ""nova-manage compute update_provider_tree""]; 'Controller' -> 'Controller' [label = ""nova-manage placement get_allocations <rp_uuid>""]; 'Controller' -> 'Compute host' [label = ""<file or stream>""]; 'Compute host' -> 'Compute host' [label = ""nova-manage compute update_provider_tree <file>""]; 'Compute host' -> 'Controller' [label = ""<file or stream>""]; 'Controller' -> 'Controller' [label = ""nova-manage placement reshape <file>""]; } Direct Interface to Placement ----------------------------- To make the ``nova-manage placement`` commands possible, we need to make placement accessible by importing Python code rather than as a standalone service. The quickest path forward is to use `wsgi-intercept`_ to allow HTTP interactions, using the `requests`_ library, to work with only database traffic going over the network. This allows client code to make changes to the placement data store using the same API, but without running a placement service. An implementation of this, as a context manager called `PlacementDirect`_, is merged. The context manager accepts an `oslo config`_, populated by the caller. This allows the calling code to control how it wishes to discover configuration settings, most importantly the database being used by placement. This implementation provides a quick solution to the immediate needs of offline use of `Placement POST /reshaper`_ while allowing options for prettier solutions in the future. Compute upgrade Script ---------------------- Since libvirt won't be running, the compute upgrade scripts are responsible for querying status of instances by directly looking up the domains. We may refer to https://review.openstack.org/#/c/501025/ for an example of an upgrade script that requires a virt driver. Alternatives ------------ Direct Placement ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Alternatives to the ``wsgi-intercept`` model for the `Direct Interface to Placement`_: * Directly access the object methods (with some refactoring/cleanup). Rejected because we lose things like schema validation and microversion logic. * Create cleaner, pythonic wrappers around those object methods. Rejected (in the short term) for the sake of expediency. We might take this approach longer-term as/when the demand for direct placement expands beyond FFU scripting. * Use ``wsgi-intercept`` but create the pythonic wrappers outside of the REST layer. This is also a long-term option. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None.

Anyone with a Gerrit account is able to provide a review. Two labels are available to everyone: * +1: Approve * -1: Changes requested It is also possible to leave comments without a label. In general, a review with comments is more valuable. Comments are especially important for a negative review. Prefer quality of reviews over quantity. You can watch specific patches in Gerrit via *Settings -> Watched Projects*. The volume of emails is not too large if you subscribe to *New Changes* only. If you do not have much time available for reviewing, consider reviewing patches in an area that is important to you or that you understand well. Core reviewers ============== Core reviewers have additional labels available to them. * +2: Approve * -2: Do not merge * Workflow +1: Approve and ready for merge Zuul requires one +2 and one workflow +1, as well as a passing check, in order for a patch to proceed to the gate. The Kolla team generally requires two +2s before a workflow +1 may be added. We also have some non-voting Zuul jobs which will not block a check, but should be investigated if they are failing. Core reviewers may still use +1 to indicate approval if they are not confident enough about a particular patch to use +2. The Kolla core reviewers have the same rights of access to stable branches, so always check the branch for a review, and use extra care with stable branches. Becoming a core reviewer ------------------------ There are no strict rules for becoming a core reviewer. Join the community, review some patches, and demonstrate responsibility, understanding & care. If you are interested in joining the core team, ask the PTL or another core reviewer how to get there.

A recent magnum bug (https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2008494)
when running with uwsgi has yielded an interesting question if Ironic
is orphaning rpc clients or not. Ironic's code is slightly different
but also very similar, and similar bugs have been observed in the past
where the python garbage collection never cleans up the old connection
objects and effectively orphans the connection.

So we should likely at least try to collect some of the information
so we can determine if this is the case in our CI jobs. Hence this
change and attempt to collect that data after running CI.

Problem description =================== Currently, cold migrate or resize instance could make the PMEM Namespaces different on host, which is a PMEM Device for the instance. But the instance's data in the PMEM Device will lose. So i want to copy the data of pmem devices for instance when cold migrating or resizing the instance. As following: 1.The instance use /dev/dax0.0 PMEM Namespace on host. 2.After cold migrate or resize instance, the PMEM Namespace is /dev/dax0.1 on host or other host. 3.Copy the data from /dev/dax0.0 to /dev/dax0.1 . Use Cases --------- * Users want to copy the data on PMEM Namespace when cold migrating or resizing instance. Otherwise, the data for instance on PMEM Namespace will lose. Proposed change =============== When migrating or resizing intance, we can get the old PMEM device and the new PMEM device from `instance.migration_context`. So we can copy the data from old PMEM device to new PMEM device. Workflow -------- When migrating or resizing intance, we can get the old PMEM device and the new PMEM device from `instance.migration_context`. So we can copy the data from old PMEM device on source_compute to new PMEM device on dest_compute. colde migrating or resizing instance workflow as following: 1.The resize_instance operation is on source_compute, free the network volume etc. resources. 2.The finish_resize operation is on dest_compute, launching a new instance with resources in step1. 3.The confirm_resize operation is on source_compute, cleaning the residual resources of the instance. In step3, the PMEM devices' data will cleanup. Before cleanup, we can copy the data from old PMEM device to new PMEM device. After copying operation, we can cleanup the data of old PMEM device.

Each shard is held on a separate database server/cluster, to spread load. Some data within a database remains present in all shards, but some appears only in a single shard. Each shard acts as the single source for this subset of data. Kolla supports sharding on service's database level, so every database can be hosted on different shard while accessible through ``kolla_internal_vip_address``. This documentation only explains the part where mariadb role installs that shards and how to configure it. Another part of implementation is defined in ProxySQL documentation HERE <TODO in followup patches>. This setup can be used also without ProxySQL, just to deploy MariaDB clusters simultaneously for whatever reason user want to do it (for example cells). Deployment ~~~~~~~~~~ In order to deploy several MariaDB cluster, you will need to edit inventory file in way described below: #. Add ``mariadb_shard_id`` hostvar to hosts which are members of common cluster (shard) as it is in example below: .. code-block:: ini [mariadb] server1ofcluster0 server2ofcluster0 server1ofcluster1 mariadb_shard_id=1 server2ofcluster1 mariadb_shard_id=1 server1ofcluster2 mariadb_shard_id=2 server2ofcluster2 mariadb_shard_id=2 .. note:: If ``mariadb_shard_id`` is not defined for host in inventory file it will be set automatically to ``mariadb_default_database_shard_id`` (default 0) from ``group_vars/all.yml`` and can be overwritten in ``/etc/kolla/globals.yml``. Shard which is marked as default is special in case of backup or loadbalance, as it is described below. Loadbalancer ------------ Kolla currently supports balancing only for default shard. This will be changed in future by replacement of HAProxy with ProxySQL. This results in certain limitations as described below. Backup and restore ------------------ Backup and restore is working only for default shard as kolla currently using HAProxy solution for MariaDB loadbalancer which is simple TCP and has configured only default shard hosts as backends, therefore backup script will reach only default shard on ``kolla_internal_vip_address``.

At start up of nova-compute service, the PCI stat pools are
populated based on information in pci_devices table in Nova
database. The pools are updated only when new device is added
or removed but not on any device changes like device type.

If an existing device is configured as SRIOV and nova-compute
is restarted, the pci_devices table gets updated but the device
is still listed under the old pool in pci_tracker.stats.pool
(in-memory object).

This patch looks for device type updates in existing devices
and updates the pools accordingly.

The functional test requires to skip the capabilities of pci

pci_dev_template [1] which is introduced by commit
b927748c257e705903c2aa0ffa47b19914e31ede. Not able to clean
backport the mentioned commit and so removed funtional test

NOTE: config-drive is always disabled for the
virtual barmetal intances. This is already hard
coded in virtual-baremetal-servers.yaml and
virtual-baremetal-servers-volume.yaml.

When uploading multiple files through the form upload middleware
it would take the first file's content type and encoding and wrongly
apply it to all the uploaded files.

This was because there was a shared 'attributes' dict for all body parts
which was (correctly) filled from all the non-file parts. The file parts
however would also set their 'Content-Type' and 'Content-Encoding'
header values in the attributes dict.

The content type/encoding handling made sure to not overwrite
existing values in the dict. Thus the first file to specify such a
header value would win.

Now the individual files get their own content types/encodings by
applying the file part content type/encoding headers only to a copy
of the dict.

The file parts' headers continue to be ignored if they are overridden
by explicit 'content-type'/'content-encoding' body parts.

was disabled we should still call update_nat_rules() which will then
remove the NAT entry from the OVN NB DB.

With this patch, Monasca no longer relies on automatic topic creation
in Kafka, and instead pre-creates all topics before bringing up the
containers. If the topic already exists then it will not be
changed, therefore existing users are not affected.

This patch allows per topic customisations, such as increasing the
number of partitions on particular topics and also works around
a race condition in automatic topic creation where multiple instances
of the same service could race to create a topic causing some of the
services to restart and throw an error before resuming normal
operation.

For large-scale openstack clusters, cell v2 architecture is used to
reduce the pressure on rabbitmq and mysql.

When one cell is expanded with new computing nodes, on the one hand,
the scheduler will attempt to discover new hosts that have been added
to the cell if we enabled discover_hosts_in_cells_interval periodic
task, on the other hand, devops have to discover hosts by manually if it
disabled. We recommend disable it for production environment in order to
avoid any overhead from constantly checking.

If new computing nodes are added to a cell, before the devops manually
execute discover, it will be failed if the newly instance is scheduled
to these computing nodes because of HostMappingNotFound exception.
At this time, the scheduler has already created allocations for the
failed instance, so the error instance will occupy the resources of the
computing node. This is inconsistent with the actual situation. The
instance does not occupy any resources theoretically due to the
scheduling failure, so allocations of the instance has to be deleted.

Change the swift-manage-shard-ranges default expansion-limit to equal
the sharder daemon default merge_size i.e 750000. The previous default
of 500000 had erroneously differed from the sharder default value.

Introduce a ContainerSharderConf class to encapsulate loading of
sharder conf and the definition of defaults. ContainerSharder inherits
this and swift-manage-shard-ranges instantiates it.

Rename ContainerSharder member vars to match the equivalent vars and
cli options in manage_shard_ranges:

  shrink_size -> shrink_threshold
  merge_size -> expansion_limit
  split_size -> rows_per_shard

(This direction of renaming is chosen so that the manage_shard_ranges
cli options are not changed.)

Rename ContainerSharder member vars to match the conf file option name:
  scanner_batch_size -> shard_scanner_batch_size

Remove some ContainerSharder member vars that were not used outside of
the __init__ method:

  shrink_merge_point
  shard_shrink_point

In different location we assume system_metadata.image_base_image_ref
exists, because it is set during instance creation in method
_populate_instance_for_create

But once instance is rebuild, all system_metadata image property a dropped
and replace by new image property and without setting back
image_base_image_ref.

This change propose to set image_base_image_ref during rebuild.

In specific case of shelve/unshelve in Qcow2 backend, image_base_image_ref is
used to rebase disk image, so we ensure this property is set as instance may
have been rebuild before the fix was apply.

During unshelve, instance is spawn with image created by shelve
and is deleted just after, instance.image_ref still point
to the original instance build image.

In qcow2 environment, this is an issue because instance backing file
don't match anymore instance.image_ref and during live-migration/resize,
target host will fetch image corresponding to instance.image_ref
involving instance corruption.

This change fetches original image and rebase instance disk on it.
This avoid image_ref mismatch and bring back storage benefit to keep common
image in cache.

If original image is no more available in glance, backing file is merged into
disk(flatten), ensuring instance integrity during next live-migration/resize
operation.

Instead of creating ceph_admin_extra_vars with
distribute_private_key always set to true, set
that variable to true only when appropriate based
on logic in the depends-on patch.

Also, it is not necessary to override the values of
tripleo_admin_generate_key or ssh_servers to create
the ceph-admin user for cephadm.

There was a traceback being included in the
error message body. This is unhelpful to
end users.

The error message that included the traceback
was for this corner case where the RBAC policy
isn't aligned with the internal ""context_is_admin""
policy - an unlikely combination of decisions
that a deployer would make - nevertheless,
this is an opportunity for us to fix this

Access rules added to CephFS shares can fail
at the driver, or by the ceph volume client library.
Since the share manager can supply rule changes to
the driver in batches, the driver has to gracefully
handle individual rule failures.

Further some of the causes of the access rule
failures can be remedied by end users, therefore
asynchronous user messages would be a good vehicle
to register user faults that can be examined and
corrected.

When a router set as HA mode, The keepalived process will take over
the route entry's generation. So, the codes that add static route
is redundant.

But, for DVR-HA router, in dvr_snat node the keepalived process run
in snat-namespace and don't take over qrouter-namespace, so the
manually add static route codes still need be called.

We removed calls to configure the libvirt-based firewall driver in
'_create_guest_with_network' as part of change
I5a9e5532c46a5f7064441ae644125d21efe5fda1. Since then, there only other
way we can successfully create a guest and still end up in an exception
handler is if the plugging of VIFs fails. Despite this, all three code
paths still contained references to a 'guest' attribute that would never
be set.

Clarify things by removing the use of the 'guest' attribute from the
other code paths. This means the '_cleanup_failed_start' helper only has
one caller and some unnecessary logic itself, so we can fold that into
its caller. We also take this opportunity to remove an unnecessary
error handler - 'nova.exception.VirtualInterfaceCreateException' is
derived from 'Exception' and doesn't need its own handler - and add the
type hints for the function. The heavy lifting for the latter was
already done in change I2489bf16dabc8a83b2044139247f4245ae29adb1 so this
is pretty easy to grok.

Next up, we really need to stop passing around dicts of block device
mapping info, but that's another change for another day.

In Cinder we always try to have sane defaults, but the current RBD
default for rbd_exclusive_cinder_pools may lead to issues on deployments
with a large number of volumes:

- Cinder taking a long time to start.
- Cinder becoming non-responsive.
- Cinder stats gathering taking longer than the gathering period.

This is cause by the driver making an independent request to get
detailed information on each image to accurately calculate the space
used by the Cinder volumes.

With this patch we change the default to make sure that these issues
don't happen in the most common deployment case (the exclusive Cinder
pool).

Pool sharing is strongly discouraged, and if we were to share the pool with other services, within OpenStack (Nova, Glance, another Cinder backend) or outside of OpenStack (oVirt), then the stats returned by the driver to the scheduler would not be entirely accurate. The inaccuracy would be that the actual size in use by the cinder volumes would be lower than the reported one, since it would be also including the used space by the other services. We can set the ``rbd_exclusive_cinder_pool`` configuration option to ``false`` to fix this inaccuracy, but this has a performance impact. .. warning:: Setting ``rbd_exclusive_cinder_pool`` to ``false`` will increase the burden on the Cinder driver and the Ceph cluster, since a request will be made for each existing image, to retrieve its size, during the stats gathering process. For deployments with large amount of volumes it is recommended to leave the default value of ``true``, and accept the inaccuracy, as it should not be particularly problematic. ",,54,3

Specifying specific nodes for these jobs was a holdover from
ussuri.  For wallaby and victoria, py36 and py38 should be
available on all nodes, so we can just use the default.

original commit message:
Run functional job on Ubuntu Focal

Devstack is planning to remove the Ubuntu
Bionic support.
- https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/devstack/+/788754

Before that we need to switch Bionic job to focal.
devstack-tox-functional define the latest nodeset which is
single node focal currently so removing nodeset setting from
python-cinderclient functional jobs.

The conditional used in the NetworkConfig block always
evaluates to conclude that network config should be
applied.

Use | int filter on the slurped os-net-config return

Ensure that there are no VMs running on the `nova-compute` unit that's about to be removed. Running juju action `disable` will ensure that `nova-scheduler` wont start any new VMs on this unit. Then either destroy or migrate any VMs that are running on this unit. 2. Run juju action `remove-from-cloud`. This will stop nova-compute service on this unit and it will unregister this unit from the nova-cloud-controller application, thereby effectively removing it from the OpenStack cloud. 3. Run the `juju remove-unit` command to remove this unit from the model. ### Undoing unit removal If the third step (`juju remove-unit`) was not executed, the whole process can be reverted by running juju actions `register-to-cloud` and `enable`. This will start `nova compute` services again and it will enable `nova-scheduler` to run new VMs on this unit.display action descriptions run `juju actions nova-compute`.

Ussuri & earlier only

After upgrading from Train to Ussuri, if the keepalived configuration is
unchanged, it is possible that the primary keepalived container will not
be upgraded. This happens because we do not import check-containers.yml
in upgrade.yml, meaning that the 'Restart keepalived container' handler
does not fire. This change fixes the issue.

When an allocation is created, the list of available nodes is searched a node with the given *resource class* and *traits*, similarly to how it is done in :doc:`OpenStack Compute flavors </install/configure-nova-flavors>`. Only the resource class is mandatory, for example: .. code-block:: console $ baremetal allocation create --resource-class baremetal --wait +-----------------+--------------------------------------+ | Field | Value | +-----------------+--------------------------------------+ | candidate_nodes | [] | | created_at | 2019-04-03T12:18:26+00:00 | | extra | {} | | last_error | None | | name | None | | node_uuid | 5d946337-b1d9-4b06-8eda-4fb77e994a0d | | resource_class | baremetal | | state | active | | traits | [] | | updated_at | 2019-04-03T12:18:26+00:00 | | uuid | e84f5d60-84f1-4701-a635-10ff90e2f3b0 | +-----------------+--------------------------------------+ .. note:: The allocation processing is fast but nonetheless asynchronous. Use the ``--wait`` argument to wait for the results. If an allocation is successful, it sets the node's ``instance_uuid`` to the allocation UUID. The node's UUID can be retrieved from the allocation's ``node_uuid`` field. An allocation is automatically deleted when the associated node is unprovisioned. If you don't provision the node, you're responsible for deleting the allocation. See the `allocation API reference <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/baremetal/?expanded=create-allocation-detail#create-allocation>`_ for more information on how to use allocations. Populating instance information ------------------------------- The node's ``instance_info`` field is a JSON object that contains all information required for deploying an instance on bare metal. It has to be populated before deployment and is automatically cleared on tear down. mandatory. The following schemes are supported: ``http://``, ``https://`` and ``file://``. Files have to be accessible by the conductor. If the scheme is missing, an Image Service (glance) image UUID is assumed. Other checksum algorithms are supported via the ``image_os_hash_algo`` and ``image_os_hash_value`` fields. They may be used instead of the ``image_checksum`` field. .. code-block:: console $ cd /path/to/http/root $ md5sum *.img > checksums Supports the same schemes as ``image_source``. An example for a partition image: --instance-info image_source=http://image.server/my-image.qcow2 \ --instance-info image_checksum=1f9c0e1bad977a954ba40928c1e11f33 \ --instance-info kernel=http://image.server/my-image.kernel \ --instance-info ramdisk=://image.server/my-image.initramfs \ --instance-info image_source=http://image.server/my-image.qcow2 \ --instance-info image_os_hash_value=a64dd95e0c48e61ed741ff026d8c89ca38a51f3799955097c5123b1705ef13d4 \ --instance-info kernel=http://image.server/my-image.kernel \ --instance-info ramdisk=://image.server/my-image.initramfs \With a whole disk image and a checksum URL: --instance-info image_source=http://image.server/my-image.qcow2 \ --instance-info image_checksum=http://image.server/my-image.qcow2.CHECKSUM Certain hardware types and interfaces may require additional or different fields to be provided. See specific guides under :doc:`/admin/drivers`.Attaching virtual interfaces ---------------------------- If using the OpenStack Networking service (neutron), you can attach its ports to a node before deployment as VIFs: .. code-block:: shell baremetal node vif attach $NODE_UUID $PORT_UUID .. warning:: These are **neutron** ports, not **ironic** ports! VIFs are automatically detached on deprovisioning. #. Starting with the Wallaby release you can also request custom deploy steps, see :ref:`standalone-deploy-steps` for details. .. _deploy-configdrive: Deploying with a config drive ----------------------------- The configuration drive is a small image used to store instance-specific metadata and is present to the instance as a disk partition labeled ``config-2``. See :doc:`/install/configdrive` for a detailed explanation. A configuration drive can be provided either as a whole ISO 9660 image or as JSON input for building an image. A first-boot service, such as cloud-init_, must be running on the instance image for the configuration to be applied. .. _cloud-init: https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Building a config drive on the client side ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ For the format of the configuration drive, Bare Metal service expects a ``gzipped`` and ``base64`` encoded ISO 9660 file with a ``config-2`` label. The :python-ironicclient-doc:`baremetal client <cli/osc_plugin_cli.html>` can generate a configuration drive in the `expected format`_. Pass a directory path containing the files that will be injected into it via the ``--config-drive`` parameter of the ``baremetal node deploy`` command, for example: .. code-block:: shell baremetal node deploy $NODE_UUID --config-drive /dir/configdrive_files .. note:: A configuration drive could also be a data block with a VFAT filesystem on it instead of ISO 9660. But it's unlikely that it would be needed since ISO 9660 is widely supported across operating systems. .. _expected format: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/metadata.html#config-drives Building a config drive on the conductor side ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Starting with the Stein release and `ironicclient` 2.7.0, you can request building a configdrive on the server side by providing a JSON with keys ``meta_data``, ``user_data`` and ``network_data`` (all optional), e.g.: .. code-block:: bash baremetal node deploy $node_identifier \ --config-drive '{""meta_data"": {""hostname"": ""server1.cluster""}}' .. note:: When this feature is used, host name defaults to the node's name or UUID. SSH public keys can be provided as a mapping: .. code-block:: shellIf using cloud-init_, its configuration can be supplied as ``user_data``, e.g.: .. code-block:: shell baremetal node deploy $NODE_UUID \ --config-drive '{""user_data"": ""#cloud-config\n{\""users\"": [{\""name\"": ...}]}""}' .. warning:: User data is a string, not a JSON! Also note that a prefix, such as ``#cloud-config``, is required, see `user data format <https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/format.html>`_. Some first-boot services support network configuration in the `OpenStack network data format <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/metadata.html#openstack-format-metadata>`_. It can be provided in the ``network_data`` field of the configuration drive.",".. _Metal3: http://metal3.io/ Populating instance_info ------------------------ mandatory. .. note:: Additional checksum support exists via the ``image_os_hash_algo`` and ``image_os_hash_value`` fields. They may be used instead of the ``image_checksum`` field. .. code-block:: shell cd /path/to/http/root md5sum *.img > checksums For example: --instance-info image_source=$IMG \ --instance-info image_checksum=$MD5HASH \ --instance-info kernel=$KERNEL \ --instance-info ramdisk=$RAMDISK \ --instance-info image_source=$IMG \ --instance-info image_os_hash_value=$SHA256HASH \ --instance-info kernel=$KERNEL \ --instance-info ramdisk=$RAMDISK \With a whole disk image: --instance-info image_source=$IMG \ --instance-info image_checksum=$MD5HASH For iLO drivers, fields that should be provided are: * ``ilo_deploy_iso`` under ``driver_info``; * ``ilo_boot_iso``, ``image_source``, ``root_gb`` under ``instance_info``.#. You can provide a configdrive as a JSON or as an ISO image, e.g.: .. code-block:: shell See :doc:`/install/configdrive` for details. #.

At present QEMU will raise an error to libvirt when a device_del request
is made for a device that has already partially detached through a
previous request. This is outlined in more detail in the following
downstream Red Hat QEMU bug report:

Get libvirtError ""Device XX is already in the process of unplug"" [..]
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1878659

Within Nova we can actually ignore this error and allow our existing
retry logic to attempt again after a short wait, hopefully allowing the
original request to complete removing the device from the domain.

This change does this and should result in one of the following
device_del requests raising a VIR_ERR_DEVICE_MISSING error from libvirt.
_try_detach_device should then translate that libvirt error into a
DeviceNotFound exception which is itself then ignored by all
detach_device_with_retry callers and taken to mean that the device has
detached successfully.

NOTE(lyarwood): For stable/victoria the conditional has been inlined
within some VIR_ERR_DEVICE_MISSING compat code removed in stable/wallaby
by I181b3bf433b0fcef92ef4d430e9858506f24153c. Additionally the
supports_device_missing_error_code kwarg is added to the
detach_device_with_retry call within the test to ensure the exception is
checked.

detached successfully.

When new dvr router is going to be created on the node, L3 agent
asks server for list of ports plugged to the subnets, to populate
arp entries for all fixed IPs from those ports.
There was missing info about allowed address pairs there, so those
IPs were not populated in the qrouter namespace.
Now it's added and L3 agent can add those arp entries to the qrouter
namespaces too.

Ussuri & earlier only

After upgrading from Train to Ussuri, if the keepalived configuration is
unchanged, it is possible that the primary keepalived container will not
be upgraded. This happens because we do not import check-containers.yml
in upgrade.yml, meaning that the 'Restart keepalived container' handler
does not fire. This change fixes the issue.

In order to retrieve shares with filters
pertaining to separate tables (shares, instances, metadata,
etc), we need to perform joined loads of those
respective database tables as necessary. After the
join, the query cannot select entities due to
Github issue #6253 - The following is an error when
the pattern is used:

sqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError: Query has only expression-based entities - can't find property named ""share_metadata"".

sqlalchemy 1.4 has a performance improvement that
delays query processing [2] and disallows this
pattern of usage; we can use a query.count() instead.

In another instance, we can perform joins selectively
only if asked for.

Store the 'name_upper' of the networks in the

Previously a commit[1] introduced a new way of doing backup, using
""snapshots"", that do not require to bring down the whole controller to
take the backup. On that commit, the old way was removed, which do not
follow the deprecation procedure.

This commits reintroduces the old way of performing backups via stopping
the controllers and move the snapshots feature to an optional,
user-selected feature.
