The main goal of this change is to add support for Xenial to
trove/integration and ensure the voting check jobs continue
to pass when switched to Xenial.

- It was decided that Trusty should continue to be supported
to aid in the developer transition to Xenial. Therefore,
the elements have been organized to accomplish this by making
""trusty"" and ""xenial"" specific elements extend the already
existing ""ubuntu"" elements.
- We tried to do the initial work without impacting the core
Trove code therefore some choices were made - for example,
cluster delete doesn't work for PXC on Xenial (see [1]) so
the test that does this is skipped for PXC.
- Only Mysql, PXC, Postgresql and Redis were fixed for
Xenial and tested as these are the only voting jobs
currently. Future work should sort out the elements for the
rest of the datastores. Note that all of the datastores should
continue to function on Trusty.
- Previously, the ""DISTRO"" variable was hardcoded to ""ubuntu"".
This is no longer the case; DISTRO and RELEASE variables will
be automatically set to whatever the base OS is (for example,
if you are running trovestack on Xenial, DISTRO will be set
to ""ubuntu"" and RELEASE will be set to ""xenial"". These can
be overriden if needed.

In the case that the ceph storage backing volumes is different
from the one backing ephemeral storage in nova, the auth values
in the rbd connection_info could be different and not work if

This change makes the volume connection config code for rbd

The backing disk currently created is 8GB. devstack-gate
sets that to 24GB when running Tempest. We're seeing ceph
job failures due to NoValidHost in the cinder scheduler
because 8GB isn't enough capacity for Tempest runs. So this
change uses the same backing disk size for the ceph jobs as
we get in the default devstack setup, which uses LVM.

There are two issues with setting this value in devstack-gate:

1. It's already hard-coded and set to the same value in the
   devstack-plugin-ceph repo which we are now using in all
   ceph jobs after I44c3a0c35e8dbcc49c0ac1800e9075cc3a169fdd.

2. The 8GB value is not large enough compared to non-ceph jobs

   set CEPH_LOOPBACK_DISK_SIZE in change
   I788eefa6c1d427bf51d2d3d40be4abe0336443e7.

We can remove this now before the devstack-plugin-ceph change is
merged because the plugin is already hard-coding the same value.

The LibvirtNetVolumeDriver is handling both rbd and
sheepdog (iscsi) connections. The auth config logic
is mingling both backends which is really confusing.

For example, the iscsi protocol only defines auth_method,
auth_username and auth_password. It does not set an
auth_enabled value in the connection_info['data'] dict.

This change simplifies the logic involved for setting
the auth config by decoupling the rbd/iscsi handlers.

A follow-up change will build on this to fix the
rbd auth config to prefer the cinder volume connection_info
auth data over the local config for nova in the case
that different cinder backends are used for ephemeral
and block storage.

This is a temporary patch until issue with multiple enables is fixed.

If plugin is enabled multiple times only register 1st time

When using the enable_plugin command and grenade jobs it can be
easy to enable the same plugin twice, as the grenade job has a
registration section and the configuration in project-config can also
enable it due to code-reuse in project-config.

This change makes it so if it sees the same plugin name is enabled
more than once only the first entry will be enabled and registered.

XenAPI requires two instances of L2Agent: the standard one manages OVS
bridges in DomU and the service name is called as q-agt in Devstack;
the other new L2Agent manages OVS bridges in Dom0 and the service name
is called as q-domuA. In order to support the new agent q-domuA, it
requires some XenAPI-specific configurations. But unfortunately those
XenAPI-specific configurations were configured in the standard agent

Commit 6f8667990cdb3cd662d51be2403cca5859559f04 removed the deprecated
""--policy"" switch, which caused the check for the missing parameter
to quietly stop working correctly.

Make ""policy"" a mandatory positional parameter and let argparse
figure it out; it has a much better/more helpful error message
anyways.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================================================ Enable deployment of alternative backends for oslo.messaging ============================================================ This spec describes adding two functional capabilities to the messaging services of an overcloud deployment. The first capability is to enable the selection and configuration of separate messaging backends for oslo.messaging RPC and Notification communications. The second capability is to introduce support for a brokerless messaging backend for oslo.messaging RPC communications via the AMQP 1.0 Apache qpid-dispatch-router. Problem Description =================== The oslo.messaging library supports the deployment of dual messaging system backends. This enables alternative backends to be deployed for RPC and Notification messaging communications. Users have identified the constraints of using a store and forward (broker based) messaging system for RPC communications and are seeking direct messaging (brokerless) approaches to optimize the RPC messaging pattern. In addition to operational challenges, emerging distributed cloud architectures define requirements around peer-to-peer relationships and geo-locality that can be addressed through intelligent messaging transport routing capabilities such as is provided by the AMQP 1.0 qpid-dispatch-router. Proposed Change =============== Overview -------- Provide the capability to select and configure alternative transport_url's for oslo.messaging RPCs and Notifications across overcloud OpenStack services. Retain the current default behavior to deploy the rabbitMQ server as the messaging backend for both RPC and Notification communications. Introduce an alternative deployment of the qpid-dispatch-router as the messaging backend for RPC communications. Utilize the oslo.messaging AMQP 1.0 driver for delivering RPC services via the dispatch-router messaging backend. Alternatives ------------ The configuration of dual backends for oslo.messaging could be performed post overcloud deployment. Security Impact --------------- The end result of using the AMQP 1.0 dispatch-router as an alternative messaging backend for oslo.messaging RPC communications should be the same from a security standpoint. The driver/router solution provides SSL and SASL support in parity to the current rabbitMQ server deployment. Other End User Impact --------------------- The configuration of the dual backends for RPC and Notification messaging communications should be transparent to the operation of the OpenStack services. Performance Impact ------------------ Using a dispatch-router mesh topology rather than broker clustering for messaging communications will have a positive impact on performance and scalability by: * Directly expanding connection capacity * Providing parallel communication flows across the mesh * Increasing aggregate message transfer capacity * Improving resource utilization of messaging infrastructure Other Deployer Impact --------------------- The deployment of the dispatch-router, however, will be new to OpenStack operators. Operators will need to learn the architectural differences as compared to a broker cluster deployment. This will include capacity planning, monitoring, troubleshooting and maintenance best practices. Developer Impact ---------------- Support for alternative oslo.messaging backends and deployment of qpid-dispatch-router in addition to rabbitMQ should be implemented for tripleo-quickstart. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: * John Eckersberg <jeckersb@redhat.com> * Andy Smith <ansmith@redhat.com> Work Items ---------- * Update overcloud templates for dual backends and dispatch-router role * Add dispatch-router packages to overcloud image elements * Add services template for dispatch-router * Update OpenStack services base templates to select and configure transport_urls for RPC and Notification * Deploy dispatch-router for controller and compute for topology * Test failure and recovery scenarios for dispatch router Transport Configuration ----------------------- The oslo.messaging configuration options define a default and additional notification transport_url. If the notification transport_url is not specified, oslo.messaging will use the default transport_url for both RPC and Notification messaging communications. The transport_url parameter is of the form:: transport://user:pass@host1:port[,hostN:porN]/virtual_host Where the transport scheme specifies the RPC or Notification backend as one of rabbit or amqp, etc. Oslo.messaging is deprecating the host, port and auth configuration options. All drivers will get these options via the transport_url. Dependencies ============ Support for dual backends in and AMQP 1.0 driver integration with the dispatch-router depends on oslo.messaging V5.10 or later. Testing ======= In order to test this in CI, an environment will be needed where dual messaging system backends (e.g. rabbitMQ server and dispatch-router server) are deployed. Any existing hardware configuration should be appropriate for the dual backend deployment. Documentation Impact ==================== The deployment documentation will need to be updated to cover the configuration of dual messaging system backends and the use of the dispatch-router. TripleO Heat template examples should also help with deployments using dual backends.

Adding a TaskManager aware wrapper around Adapter gets us a natural
interface for migrating one call at a time away from python-*client and
to direct REST calls. The Adapter shares the Session with the clients,
but it returns munches and throws exceptions that match the exceptions
we're expecting outside of shade.

Also, move compute_client calls out of their own tasks

Putting compute_client calls in a Task will cause them to be doubly
enqueued. This has to be combined with this patch because otherwise the
double-invocation fails functional tests.

Currently, the code does an initial detach from the persistent and
transient domains in one call, then follows up with a call of the
retryable function, which first checks the domain xml before retrying
the transient domain detach. If the transient domain detach (which is
asynchronous) completes after we checked the domain xml, trying to
detach it again will raise a LibvirtError exception. Then, our loop
code in `_do_wait_and_retry_detach` doesn't catch it and will respond
with error. We should be handling the `disk not found error` from
libvirt and consider the job complete.

Based on Block Storage API v2 reference guide, mountpoint
parameter of os-attach action is an optional argument.
But in fact, Cinder API v2 - os-attach fails without
mountpoint specified.

This changes current Cinder implementation to align with
the document.

During construction of an instance object from db info, a call to
_from_db_object() is made. In many situations this results in one or
more unnecessary db calls due to the way instance extras are handled.

This occurs when the following two conditions apply; (1) the
'expected_attrs' parameter contains one of the affected instance_extras
fields (see below) and (2) the corresponding value in the provided
db_instance data either does not exist or else contains None.

The affected instance extras fields are:
 - numa_topology
 - pci_requests
 - device_metadata
 - vcpu_model

This change works around this by making use of the already defined
_NO_DATA_SENTINEL object to differentiate between a None value and no
value at all so that only the latter results in calling out to the db.

Calling threading.Event.wait() when using eventlet results in a busy
loop calling epoll_wait, because the Python 2.x
threading.Condition.wait() implementation busy-waits by calling
sleep() with very small values (0.0005..0.05s).  Because sleep() is
monkey-patched by eventlet, this results in many very short timers
being added to the eventlet hub, and forces eventlet to constantly
epoll_wait looking for new data unecessarily.

This utilizes a new Event from eventletutils which conditionalizes the
event primitive depending on whether or not eventlet is being used.
If it is, eventlet.event.Event is used instead of threading.Event.
The eventlet.event.Event implementation does not suffer from the same
busy-wait sleep problem.  If eventlet is not used, the previous
behavior is retained.

For Newton backport, this bundles the Event from eventletutils
directly in oslo.messaging under the _utils module.  It is taken from:

Implement upgrade testing for os_cinder role.

This patch adds an upgrade testenv, which configures a previous version
of Cinder, and the test-vars from the previous stable branch to be used
by the previous version of Cinder.

We don't run functional tests after the initial stable/newton deploy
because a working stable/newton branch is already tested, and it's
assumed it worked if the upgrade works too - which is more
efficient.

This follows the pattern setup for Keystone in:

Some hardware doesn't support portgroup fallback to single interface
fashion. This imposes additional restrictions on ports, for example
such ports will not support booting by PXE.
This patch adds restrictions setting pxe_enabled=True on ports that
are members of portgroups with standalone_ports_supported=False. And
vice versa portgroup.standalone_ports_supported can't be set to False
until portgroup contains ports with pxe_enabled=True.

Setting 'vif_port_id' means that we are using this port in standalone

ports which are members of portgroups with
standalone_ports_supported=False. And vice versa updating portgroup

When registering a new test group we
give it a group name and a list of tests to run.

    register(['foo'], [t1, t2, t3])

creates group 'foo' running tests t1, t2 and t3.

This method has been extended to allow passing a dict
of tests with keys used as group name suffixes.

    register(['foo'], sub1=[t1, t2], sub2=[t3])

creates group 'foo' running all tests t1, t2 and t3
and groups 'foo_sub1' running t1, t2
and group 'foo_sub2' running t3

The plan is to split long-running datastore tests
into multiple sub-groups that can run as separate jobs.

Generally, we will want to run replication and
clustering in one job separate from everything else.
I have registered a 'single' (tests on a single instance)
and 'multi' (tests woring on a set of instances) sub-groups
for all datastores (for consistency).

This does not change how the tests run.
It just creates '*_single' and '*_multi' sub-groups in addition
to the existing '<datastore>_supported' groups.
We will need to update the project config to run sub-jobs
for datastores that require it.

The latest set of changes to devstack include one where enabling a
plugin more than once now causes a fatal error. Trovestack code
sources openrc, which sources other files that eventually call
enable_plugin on the trove module. Unfortunately since trovestack also

This addresses failures for neutronclient's functional job of
advanced services. VPNaaS is no longer maintained and thus it
makes sense to stop gating against it. Hook and tests are kept
for local development and in case things will resurrect back
to life.

This patch also makes extension functional tests conditional to
the presence of the extension under test.

Use of this feature requires the OpenStack client version 3.3 or newer. Before routed provider networks, the Networking service could not present a multi-segment layer-3 network as a single entity. Thus, each operator typically chose one of the following architectures: * Single large layer-2 network * Multiple smaller layer-2 networks Single large layer-2 networks become complex at scale and involve significant failure domains. Multiple smaller layer-2 networks scale better and shrink failure domains, but leave network selection to the user. Without additional information, users cannot easily differentiate these networks. A routed provider network enables a single provider network to represent multiple layer-2 networks (broadcast domains) or segments and enables the operator to present one network to users. However, the particular IP addresses available to an instance depend on the segment of the network available on the particular compute node. Similar to conventional networking, layer-2 (switching) handles transit of traffic between ports on the same segment and layer-3 (routing) handles transit of traffic between segments. Each segment requires at least one subnet that explicitly belongs to that segment. The association between a segment and a subnet distinguishes a routed provider network from other types of networks. The Networking service enforces that either zero or all subnets on a particular network associate with a segment. For example, attempting to create a subnet without a segment on a network containing subnets with segments generates an error. The Networking service does not provide layer-3 services between segments. Instead, it relies on physical network infrastructure to route subnets. Thus, both the Networking service and physical network infrastructure must contain configuration for routed provider networks, similar to conventional provider networks. In the future, implementation of dynamic routing protocols may ease configuration of routed networks. Limitations ~~~~~~~~~~~ The Newton implementation contains the following limitations: * The Compute scheduler lacks awareness of IP address resources on a routed network. Thus, the scheduler could exhaust the IP addresses in one segment before assigning IP addresses from another segment. The Ocata release of the Compute scheduler should provide the capability of scheduling around segments without available IP addresses. In Newton, the Compute scheduler selects any compute node on the provider network. If the segment on that compute node lacks available IP addresses, port binding fails and the Compute scheduler chooses another compute node without regard to segments. Rescheduling continues up to the maximum number of retries. Operators should monitor IP usage and add subnets to segments prior to exhaustion of IP addresses. For more information, see the `blueprint <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/routed-networks>`__. * A routed provider network cannot also function as a ``router:external`` networks which prevents compatibility with floating IPv4 addresses. Additional routing, possibly using :ref:`config-bgp-dynamic-routing`, could address this issue in the future. Prerequisites ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Routed provider networks require additional prerequisites over conventional provider networks. We recommend using the following procedure: #. Begin with segments. The Networking service defines a segment using the following components: * Unique physical network name * Segmentation type * Segmentation ID For example, ``provider1``, ``VLAN``, and ``2016``. See the `API reference <http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/networking/v2/#id57>`__ for more information. Within a network, use a unique physical network name for each segment which enables reuse of the same segmentation details between subnets. For example, using the same VLAN ID across all segments of a particular provider network. Similar to conventional provider networks, the operator must provision the layer-2 physical network infrastructure accordingly. #. Implement routing between segments. The Networking service does not provision routing among segments. The operator must implement routing among segments of a provider network. Each subnet on a segment must contain the gateway address of the router interface on that particular subnet. For example: =========== ======= ======================= ===================== Segment Version Addresses Gateway =========== ======= ======================= ===================== segment1 4 203.0.113.0/24 203.0.113.1 segment1 6 fd00:203:0:113::/64 fd00:203:0:113::1 segment2 4 198.51.100.0/24 198.51.100.1 segment2 6 fd00:198:51:100::/64 fd00:198:51:100::1 =========== ======= ======================= ===================== #. Map segments to compute nodes. Routed provider networks imply that compute nodes reside on different segments. The operator should maintain this mapping to assist with configuration of agents. =========== ====== ================ Host Rack Physical Network =========== ====== ================ compute0001 rack 1 segment 1 compute0002 rack 1 segment 1 ... ... ... compute0101 rack 2 segment 2 compute0102 rack 2 segment 2 compute0102 rack 2 segment 2 ... ... ... =========== ====== ================ #. Deploy DHCP agents. Unlike conventional provider networks, a DHCP agent cannot support more than one segment within a network. The operator must deploy at least one DHCP agent per segment. Consider deploying DHCP agents on compute nodes containing the segments rather than one or more network nodes to reduce node count. =========== ====== ================ Host Rack Physical Network =========== ====== ================ network0001 rack 1 segment 1 network0002 rack 2 segment 2 ... ... ... =========== ====== ================ Example configuration ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Controller node --------------- #. Enable the segments service plug-in by appending ``segments`` to the list of ``service_plugins`` in the ``neutron.conf`` file on all nodes running the ``neutron-server`` service: .. code-block:: ini [DEFAULT] ... service_plugins = ..., segments #. Restart the ``neutron-server`` service. Network or compute nodes ------------------------ * Configure the layer-2 agent on each node to map one or more segments to the appropriate physical network bridge or interface and restart the agent. Create a routed provider network ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The following steps create a routed provider network with two segments. Each segment contains one IPv4 subnet and one IPv6 subnet. #. Source the administrative project credentials. #. Create a VLAN provider network which includes a default segment. In this example, the network uses the ``provider1`` physical network with VLAN ID 2016. .. code-block:: console $ openstack network create --share --provider-physical-network provider1 \ --provider-network-type vlan --provider-segment 2016 multisegment1 +---------------------------+--------------------------------------+ | Field | Value | +---------------------------+--------------------------------------+ | admin_state_up | UP | | id | 6ab19caa-dda9-4b3d-abc4-5b8f435b98d9 | | ipv4_address_scope | None | | ipv6_address_scope | None | | l2_adjacency | True | | mtu | 1500 | | name | multisegment1 | | port_security_enabled | True | | provider:network_type | vlan | | provider:physical_network | provider1 | | provider:segmentation_id | 2016 | | router:external | Internal | | shared | True | | status | ACTIVE | | subnets | | | tags | [] | +---------------------------+--------------------------------------+ #.

This patch applies password quality rules and satisfies the following
controls:

 - RHEL-07-010090
 - RHEL-07-010100
 - RHEL-07-010110
 - RHEL-07-010120
 - RHEL-07-010130
 - RHEL-07-010140
 - RHEL-07-010150
 - RHEL-07-010160

Each password quality requirement can be turned on/off with variables
and there is one master switch variable that turns them all off. The
master switch is off by default because these rules can cause problems
with existing systems if users aren't aware of the new requirements.

This will be explained in detail in the docs in the follow-on patch.

Some accounts get repos automatically enabled when the system is
registered, which is a problem because some of these repos pull in
things we don't want like early beta versions of software.  Since
a full list of desired repos is supposed to be included as part of
the registration config, let's just disable all repos to start with

I'm not sure whether satellite has the same problem (I would think
not, since satellite should only be providing the desired repos),
so I'm only making this change for portal registration.

This patch ensures rabbitmq is configured to run on api
interface and  have short host names in /etc/hosts on each host.
Rabbit host names are generated and are not looked up in DNS
because of conflicting resolver results on different hosts.
This ensures consistency accross whole RabbitMQ cluster.

Requesting a Branch =================== The PTL or release liaison for a project may request a new branch by submitting a patch to this repository, adding the necessary branch metadata to the file describing the deliverable to be released. The release team will review the request and provide feedback about the branch point and possibly the name. Prepare the branch request by submitting a patch to this repository. * RC1 tags and stable branches should be submitted together for projects using the cycle-with-milestone release model. * Always add the new branch to the end of the list in the file being edited. * Branches should use one of the standard prefixes: stable/ -- for stable series feature/ -- for temporary feature branches driverfixes/ -- for long-term driver maintenance, beyond the end of the stable branch * stable/ and driverfixes/ branch names must match a valid series name. * If you are not the release liaison or PTL, have the PTL of the project acknowledge the request with a +1. * Do not used the ""Depends-On"" feature of zuul to make a branch request depend on merging another patch in your project. The dependency management does not work properly in the release check jobs, and the validator requires that the patch listed in your deliverable file actually be merged into a proper branch. Reviewing a Release or Branch Request ===================================== Care needs to be taken when reviewing a request such that the versionGeneral notes when reviewing a request:* Ensure that new branches are listed at the end of the branch list in the file. Deliverable repositories for projects using cycle_with_intermediatry or cycle_with_milestones should be placed in their respective releases within the deliverables directory. Deliverable repositories for projects using the indepedent release model should be placed in the ``deliverables/_independent`` directory.series to hold all of the metadata for all releases and branches of that deliverable. For each deliverable, we need to track: * the series (Kilo, Liberty, etc.) * the release model being used * for each repository * the name (such as ``openstack/oslo.config``) * the hash of the commit to be tagged * the version number to use * highlights for the release notes email (optional) * the starting points of all branches We track this metadata for the history of all releases of the deliverable, so we can render a set of release history documentation. The file should be named based on the deliverable to be tagged, so releases for ``liberty`` from the ``openstack/oslo.config`` repository will have a file in ``openstack/releases`` called ``deliverables/liberty/oslo.config.yaml``. Releases of the same deliverable from the ``stable/kilo`` branch will be described by ``deliverables/kilo/oslo.config.yaml``. Deliverables File Schema ======================== The top level of a deliverable file is a mapping with keys: ``team`` The name of the team that owns the deliverable, as listed in the governance repository data files.The slug name of the launchpad project, suitable for use in URLs.The URL or URLs to the published release notes for the deliverable for the series. Deliverables contained a single repository should simply include the URL to the notes for that repository. Deliverables made up of multiple repositories should use a hash to map each repository name to its notes URL.Either ``yes`` or ``no``, indicating whether the release announcement should include the link to the package on PyPI. Defaults to ``no``.Identify the release model used by the deliverable. See the reference section of the documentation for descriptions of the valid models.Categorize the deliverable based on what it does. See the reference section of the documentation for descriptions of the valid deliverable types.Describe how to link to artifacts produced by the project. The default is ``tarball`. Valid values are: tarball Automatically generates links to version-specific files on tarballs.openstack.org. none Do not link to anything, just show the version number.Mapping of special settings to control the behavior for each repository, keyed by the repository name. ``flags`` A list of flags attached to the repository. ``no-artifact-build-job`` This repository has no job for building an artifact, but should be tagged anyway. ``retired`` This repository is no longer used, but was present in old versions of a deliverable.This (optional) key sets the level of validation for the versions numbers. ``std`` Default: Enforces 3 digit semver version numbers in releases and allows for common alpha, beta and dev releases. This should be appropriate for most OpenStack release requirements. ``xstatic`` Allows a more flexible versioning in line with xstatic package guidelines and requirements. ``fuel`` The Fuel project manages its own packages.A list of the releases for the deliverable. ``branches`` A list of the branches for the deliverable.The version tag for that release, to be applied to all of the member projects.A list of all of the projects making up the deliverable for that release.An optional message to be included in the release note email announcing the release. (Use ``|`` to indicate a multi-line, pre-formatted message.)The name of the repository on git.openstack.org.The SHA1 hash for the commit to receive the version tag.An optional name for the base of the tarball created by the release. If no value is provided, it defaults to the repo base name. Each ``branch`` entry is a mapping with keys: ``name`` The name of the branch. ``location`` The location value depends on the name. If a branch name starts with stable/ then the location must be either an existing version tag or the most recently added version number under the releases list (allowing a tag and branch to be submitted together). All repositories associated with the version (as identified by the deliverable file) will be branched from that version using the name given. If a branch name starts with feature/ then the location must be a mapping between the target repository name and the SHA of a commit already in the target repository. If a branch name starts with driverfixes/ then the location must be a SHA of a commit already in the target repository on the associated stable branch. branches: - name: feature/random-feature-work location: openstack/oslo.config: 02a86d2eefeda5144ea8c39657aed24b8b0c9a39 branches: - name: feature/random-feature-work location: openstack/oslo.config: 02a86d2eefeda5144ea8c39657aed24b8b0c9a39 - name: stable/newton location: 1.12.1","Reviewing a Release Request --------------------------- Care needs to be taken when reviewing a release request such that the versionGeneral notes when reviewing a release request:Deliverable repositories for projects tagged with release:cycle_with_intermediatry or release:cycle_with_milestones should be placed in their respective releases within the deliverables directory.

For each release, we need to track:* the series (Kilo, Liberty, etc.) * the release model being used * for each repository * the name (such as ``openstack/oslo.config``) * the hash of the commit to be tagged * the version number to use * highlights for the release notes email (optional) We track this metadata for the history of all releases of the deliverable, so we can render a set of release history documentation. The file should be named based on the deliverable to be tagged, so releases for ``liberty`` from the ``openstack/oslo.config`` repository will have a file in ``openstack/releases`` called ``deliverables/liberty/oslo.config.yaml``. Releases of the same deliverable from the ``stable/kilo`` branch will be described by ``deliverables/kilo/oslo.config.yaml``. Deliverables File Schema ======================== The top level of a deliverable file is a mapping with keys: ``team`` The name of the team that owns the deliverable, as listed in the governance repository data files. The slug name of the launchpad project, suitable for use in URLs. The URL or URLs to the published release notes for the deliverable for the series. Deliverables contained a single repository should simply include the URL to the notes for that repository. Deliverables made up of multiple repositories should use a hash to map each repository name to its notes URL. Either ``yes`` or ``no``, indicating whether the release announcement should include the link to the package on PyPI. Defaults to ``no``. Identify the release model used by the deliverable. See the reference section of the documentation for descriptions of the valid models. Categorize the deliverable based on what it does. See the reference section of the documentation for descriptions of the valid deliverable types. Describe how to link to artifacts produced by the project. The default is ``tarball`. Valid values are: tarball Automatically generates links to version-specific files on tarballs.openstack.org. none Do not link to anything, just show the version number. Mapping of special settings to control the behavior for each repository, keyed by the repository name. ``flags`` A list of flags attached to the repository. ``no-artifact-build-job`` This repository has no job for building an artifact, but should be tagged anyway. ``retired`` This repository is no longer used, but was present in old versions of a deliverable. This (optional) key sets the level of validation for the versions numbers. ``std`` Default: Enforces 3 digit semver version numbers in releases and allows for common alpha, beta and dev releases. This should be appropriate for most OpenStack release requirements. ``xstatic`` Allows a more flexible versioning in line with xstatic package guidelines and requirements. ``fuel`` The Fuel project manages its own packages. A list of the releases for the deliverable. The version tag for that release, to be applied to all of the member projects. A list of all of the projects making up the deliverable for that release. An optional message to be included in the release note email announcing the release. (Use ``|`` to indicate a multi-line, pre-formatted message.) The name of the repository on git.openstack.org. The SHA1 hash for the commit to receive the version tag. An optional name for the base of the tarball created by the release. If no value is provided, it defaults to the repo base name.",169,89

The default introspection time for shade may be too short for some
environments. As such, extending the timeout to be longer to provide
nodes an opportunity to boot, check-in, and reply with results.

The library default, which I believe is 900 seconds, was also based

When running tasks in the scheduler, we used to simply start or step as many
tasks as we could before sleeping and then beginning again. When many
resources are in progress in parallel this can result in many API calls
executing in quick succession (i.e. without any intervening sleep), with
the result that we can hit quota limits. To prevent this, allow the
operator to configure a maximum number of resources that can be operated on
between sleeps.

Since creating resources is the most likely thing to cause problems, once
we hit the batch size limit on tasks to start, we prefer polling existing
tasks to starting new tasks. This will tend to limit the rate at which
resources get created in proportion to how long they take to create.

The current default is to maintain the existing behaviour; in future we
will likely want to tune this.

When a signal is received and processed by a Resource, there could be an
event generated automatically. For such an event, Heat is supposed to
provide some useful message (including status_reason).  But currently,
the resource code can only process ceilometer alarms and watch rules,
for signals sent for a SoftwareDeployment resource, the signal is only
providing an string 'Unknown' as the status change reason.  This is
confusing when a user performs 'heat event-list stack'.

This patch adds an additional check whether the signal comes
from a SoftwareDeployment.  In that case, fill show the status
reason as 'deployment succeeded', or 'deployment failed (n)', where n is
the deploy_status_code that comes with the signal.

Some particular integration tests can only succeed if the tests
are being run locally on the same node Heat is running,
but sometimes it might be useful to have ability to run these tests against
an already deployed remote Heat to validate its functionality.

This patch adds a new integration tests config option ""external_test_run""
(defaults to False) and gives ability skip particular tests
if it is set to True.

Notification, reload on SIGHUP and purge deleted stacks tests
are marked as such outright.

all exceptions to move stack to UPDATE_FAILED

If an exception occurs after a stack has been put into
CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, but not while actually
running the tasks that perform the actual resource changes,
then the operation can be aborted leaving the stack stuck
in the IN_PROGRESS state.

This patch will catch any exceptions that happen after the
stack goes into the UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS, to make sure to
move the stack to FAILED with the reason.

Recently the following problem raised: in order to deploy
a node, OneView driver strongly requires to power off the
node just before calling set_boot_device.
Therefore the method for now is lazily applying boot device
and power off the node only when it is needed, so that it is
supposed to be consistent with other user's behaviour.

Took into account removing 'vendor passthru' cleanup in
OneView deploy driver.

Currently nova_apigw in the Tricircle doesn't support server
group[1], so we can't enforce affinity or anti-affinity policy
when creating VMs.

This patch adds server group support to the Tricircle. A server
group controller handling CRUD operations is implemented in
nova_apigw.

Server group controller will not create bottom server group when
handling server group creation. Bottom server group is created
during VM creation, like how we handle network, subnet, port
resources. Bottom server group creation will be implemented
in next patch.

1. What is the problem?
In dynamic pod binding[1], the Tricircle needs to bind a tenant to a pod
which provisions a specific type of resources based on the  extra-spec.
Hence, each pod should be attached with a resource_affinity_tag, so that
the Tricircle can select all the pods whose resource_affinity_tag
matches the extra_spec tag.

2. What is the solution to the problem?
To facilitate selecting available pods which provision a type of
resources, we add a new column named “resource_affinity_tag” to the pod
table in this patch.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle to realize
the solution?
No extra features needs to be implemented in this patch.

Debootstrap only supports one apt repository to install packages from.
As a result, we do not consider the updates repo during debootstrap
causing us install a second kernel when we do an apt-get dist-upgrade
during build.

Lets use debootstrap to get us a minimal chroot, then add our repos and
install the correct packages from the start.

We also have to reorder the dpkg root.d scripts which configure apt so
they run before we perform our package installs.

Kolla supports adding plugin to horizon and neutron-server images now,
but it doesn't support adding plugin to keystone image.

As keystone itself supports adding authentication plugins, there is a
good chance that user may implement their own plugins for keystone
authentication and identity. It would be better that kolla supports
adding plugin for keystone image just the way like horizon and neutron-server.

After copy/pasting almost code from isa_l_rs_vand.c to isa_l_rs_cauchy.c,
I'm realizing to wonder why I didn't make the common functions as the base
funcitonalities.

This is my current answer, we can make isa_l_common.c file for common
fucntions like encode/decode/reconstruct. That is because the difference
between isa_l_rs_vand and isa_l_cauchy is just a function entry point for
matrix generation and it will be loaded by dlsym from .so file. Hence,
what we need is just *init* to define what function from isa_l library used
in the backend and attach it to the descriptor in the init function for
each backend.

On-disk, serialized ring files are byteorder dependent, which makes then
unportable between different endian architectures. Add a field to the
ring dictionary in the file indicating the byteorder used to generate
the file, and then byteswap if necessary when deserializing the file.

This patch only allows newly created ring files to be byteoder
agnostic. Previously generated ring files will still fail on different
endian architectures, and will need to be regenerated with this patch.
