osc-lib is a package of common support modules for writing

osc-lib.

So use osc-lib instead of openstackclient.

This step needs to be run after the major-upgrade-pacemaker-init.yaml
step and after the liberty->mitaka aodh upgrade step.
It is split in more parts:

1) Here we run a small puppet manifest that configures keystone to be
run under httpd. This part does not restart httpd at all because doing
so before turning off the openstack-keystone resource would fail
due to both services wanting to listen on the same ports.

2) In this step we add a dummy openstack-core resource, delete the
openstack-keystone resource and make sure that all the resources that
were previously depending on keystone now depend on the dummy resource.

3) We restart httpd to make sure the changes are taking place.

The rationale for doing the whole keystone migration in this single step
is that it will be verifiable on its own. We also need to add both
the aodh and the horizon apache configuration to make sure we do not
remove any services from httpd during the upgrade.

Recently OpenStack introduced a mechanism to specify a constrained
""working set"" of packages that are ""guaranteed"" to produce a working
OpenStack environment. This pinning of packages limits the more
broadly-defined requirements.txt which is managed by
global-requirements.

This patch modifies our tox test environment to use upper-constraints
and explictly removes those requirements from the ""venv"" tox
environment that is used by some commands in infra.

There are two timeouts that can cause migration to be aborted,
one looks to see if forward progress is being made, while the
other checks an overall time limit. Split out the code for
checking these limits into a separate method and add some
explicit unit testing for the scenarios they encounter.

When we see a job type of ""NONE"", we have code to convert that
to another more useful job type. Split this code out into its
own method to make it easier to test it in isolation. This new
testing exposed a bug in log debug messages where the 'ex'
parameter was not being correctly passed in a dict.

Refactoring of mocking in migration tests in test_driver.py is
left as a future exercise once this whole series is merged.

Instead of using the same logger for all the things
which makes it incredibly hard to figure out what the images
and there builds are doing; instead have it so that each
image gets its own logger which is then used by tasks that
process that image.

Each images logs now will (optionally) go to a logs directory
that can be more easily read and looked over and leaves
the main logger for informational/task kind of
output only.

Fedora 24 has split locales into separate packages.  Testing revealed
what is possibly a bug in the choosing of default packages, so add a
small work-around to ensure the minimal locale pack is installed.

This appears to be the only change required for fedora-minimal with
Fedora 24; at least to build with the project-config infra elements.

The resetting of in-progress stacks at startup is done using an admin
context. No user actions (e.g. ReST API calls) are performed, so there is
no need to load the user context that is stored with the stack. (Nor is
the
current context rewritten to the database in the process of resetting the
state.)

Since loading the user context from the DB may result in a call to the
keystone API, eliminating this ensures that stacks can be reset
successfully even if heat-engine starts before keystone is available.

Also there is no need to resolve outputs data while reset stacks, so set
resolve_data=False when load stack.

Currently, if ceilometer is enabled with glance then the
rabbitmq is non-functional, causing various glance failures
including image upload.

This is caused because:
The generated config fails to have a carriage return at the
end of the rabbit_host line, causing the following line to
be added to this entry.

rabbit_host is used rather than rabbit_hosts, where the
fromer expects a string, rather than the list that is
provided.

This also adds rabbit HA support, to be in-line with the
other services using rabbitmq.

This is resolved, by pushing the rabbit_hosts entry to be
last, meaning that a carriage return is not required.

This patch adds two new features:

  * Output is now in RST format
  * Ansible roles in OSA are diffed as well

The RST output makes it easier to copy/paste the output into release
notes, documentation, or other RST-formatted items.

The script also diffs the Ansible roles that are installed along with
OpenStack-Ansible. These were helper roles in Liberty and earlier,
but they include the IRR roles in Mitaka and beyond.

This commit fixes how we use the global configuration path as part of
the tempest init command. The concept behind the global config dir is
that is used as an initial preseed of the local etc/ dirs that get
used in each workspace. However, right now the init command relies on
python packaging to try and figure out where this dir lives. This is
because we implicitly are relying on the data_files construct in the
python packaging ecosystem to create this global configuration dir.
This however is a mistake and causes nondeterminism and lots of bugs
because python packaging is never consistent in how it handles these.

Instead of futily attempting to guess where python might put the data
files and hoping that we got it right, this commit switches to an
opinionated stance on where these directories live, it becomes a
documented set of places and the burden is switched to the installer
and or user to make sure these directories are correctly populated.
While this requires an extra step in some installation scenarios it's
a necessary extra step to ensure things actually work. As part of
this change it was also necessary to update certain functions to be
more resilient against the absence of any files in the global config
dir.

In current fullstack test cases of SG in test_apps.py,
the codes assumed that fixed IP addresses of VM ports
wound begin with the value of network prefix plus three.
That can't be guaranteed by the DHCP sever. Directly get
the IP address of a already created VM port may be the
right way.
Besides, this patch also fix errors in test_pub_sub by
creating the chassis with a format in accordance with
current implementation in codes.

I originally thought this was a good idea and long term I think it is.
The problem is that some tests need to use this fixture in the test
method itself and that will run after `load_backends()`, which also
tries to setup auth plugins.

This should come back after the tests are in good enough shapre to
support it.

Adds default values for policy rules in code and removes
them from etc/policy.json file. The change is validated
by the nova.tests.unit.test_policy unit tests.

Adds default policy rules in policy_fixture. The policy_fixture
is currently loading an incomplete set of policy rules (from

with an incomplete set of policy rules.

The precommit driver method should fail the creation of a flow classifier

In this case, we should expose the drivers exception to the user, so he/she

The general error does not help the user.

The network API will raise UnableToAutoAllocateNetwork if,
well, it's unable to automatically allocate a network for the
project (if one is not already available or requested).

For Neutron this most likely means something has gone wrong
in the deployment (since we checked a dry-run that we could do
this in the API) and rescheduling isn't going to fix it, so we
want to abort the server build and put it into ERROR state.

1. What is the problem:
Neutron removes _allocate_specific_ip function
(https://review.openstack.org/#/c/303638/), but stub function
_allocate_specific_ip function still exsits in PluginTest, this will
lead to the Tricircle unit test failed.

2. What's need to be fixed:
In tricircle/tests/unit/network/test_plugin.py
remove the stub function _allocate_specific_ip.

3. What is the purpose of this patch set:
To make the Tricircle adapt to the change of Neutron so that the unit
test of the Tricircle could be exceuted successfully.

This fix wasn't addressing the root cause of why
_restore_local_vlan_map was processing ports from different
networks that had the same VLAN tag. It was just making it so
the agent could start but led to a chance of breaking a set of

mask_password when given a value of:

 {'ipmi_password': 'foo'} will return {'ipmi_password': '****'}

But passing the same dict to mask_dict_password() would return the dict
unchanged.

This fixes it so that it works consistently on which keys will trigger a
masking of the password.

At present if the Trove plugin is enabled and Horizon is enabled,
the Trove dashboard still needs to be enabled (which is currently
done by redstack). This should be handled by the Trove plugin
itself.

With this fix, if Trove and Horizon are installed the dashboard
will be automatically set up.

Some variable names were modified slightly as well to bring
them in line with the rest.

The cleanup code was also moved to the 'stop' section, which is
where it probably belonged right from the beginning.

Commit 0a592b4 introduced a change where a hierarchy of projects
is created. Of course, the parent project is created before the
child project. The project cleanup code was deleting projects in
the order that they're created. Keystone doesn't allow deleting the
parent before the children so this was causing the project to be
left around (the DELETE operation was failing but cleanup failures
are ignored).

The fix here is to do the cleanups in reverse order so that the
child is deleted before the parent.

The replication scenario tests were broken into separate
parts to facilitate parallel runs in the gate.

The verify_data helper was also enhanced to retry so that
arbitrary sleeps are no longer necessary to ensure that
data has time to replicate.

Additional data was also added/verified once the replication

keystone.common.config is 1200+ lines of super dense, merge-conflict
prone, difficult to navigate, and finicky to maintain code. Let's follow
nova's lead and break it down into more manageable modules.

This patch creates a new Python package, keystone.conf, and moves all of
our configuration options into it, mirroring nova's nova.conf package.

There are a couple special modules in keystone.conf introduced here as
well:

- keystone.conf.__init__: This causes all of Keystone options to be
  registered on import, so consumers of keystone.conf don't have
  races with config initialization code while trying to use
  oslo_config.cfg.CONF directly (keystone.conf replaces all uses for
  oslo_config.cfg.CONF in keystone).

- keystone.conf.base: Keystone's [DEFAULT] group options. I'd prefer
  this to be called 'default.py', but I'm just copying nova's lead here.

- keystone.conf.opts: The entry point for oslo.config itself.

- keystone.conf.constants: There are a few constants (deprecation
  messages, default paths, etc) that are used by multiple configuration
  modules, so they need to live in a common place.

We have implemented cascade deleting volume in CLI now,
but there's still something that should be improved:

1. A parsing problem of cascade is existing that always
evaluate parameter to True.

So now change the cascade parameter to a flag that don't
accept value anymore.

If user want to delete volume with snapshot, just need to
use 'cinder delete --cascade [volume_id]'.

This patch adds registry-based drawer views to the searchlight table.  This
means that for each resource type, the registry sees if there is a registered
summary view; if there is then it is shown, and if it is not present the
default view is presented.

The patch breaks out the views and also uses sl-drawer to encapsulate the
view, to be in alignment with the expectation of drawers (that they have an
'item' on their scope, etc.).

In order to allow replication sets to be all on the same hypervisor
(affinity) or all on different hypervisors (anti-affinity) a new
argument (locality) needed to be added to the Trove create API.

This changeset addresses the Trove server part of this feature.
'locality' can now be added to the ReST payload for a create command
and it is passed along as a scheduler hint to Nova.

The replication scenario tests were enhanced to test that 'affinity'
works and 'anti-affinity' fails (since devstack sets up a single
hypervisor by default). A check for the existance (and
lack of) server-groups was added. This is to ensure that not only is
the server-group created properly, but also that it has been deleted
after all the related instances are gone.

Backup across availability_zones is a typical scenario for disaster recovery: say, backup driver located in AZ-1 is configured to backup data to backup backend located in AZ-2. When AZ-1 crashes, user tries to restore volume from the backup data located in AZ-2. It would be useful to provide parameters for user to specify the availability_zone and the volume type of the restore volume. The availability_zone parameter will enable user to create a restore volume to a specified availability_zone where the backup data actually locate in. The geographical locality will enhance the performance for restore copy. While with the volume_type parameter, the backup restore API can provide more options for user to create a restore volume, say, with rbd backup backend, compared with LVM, user could choose to restore to a rbd volume, where restore will do diff copy instead of full copy and thus enhance restore efficiency. Problem description =================== Currently, when user makes a request to restore a backup without volume_id, the backup-restore API will create a restore volume with default volume_type (none) to default availability_zone (none). As the availability_zone is none, cinder scheduler will randomly pick up one availability_zone to create this restore volume. In one typical disaster recovery scenario described above, restore volume with randomly selected availability_zone may locate in an availability_zone geographically far away from backup data. In this way, restore might fail if the restore side backup driver could not access backup data across availability_zones. Even if backup driver could access backup data remotely, cross-wan IO will cause a performance penalty. No matter for the sake of correctness or efficiency, user would like to have control of specifying the availability_zone of restore volume. Without volume type option, the restore volume will be created with default volume type and thus default volume backend. Since the default volume backend may not understand the backup data format, the backup driver may not be able to take the most efficient way to restore from the backup data but will do a full copy. It is better to give user more options to enhance restore performance. Proposed change =============== In order to solve this problem, we add two optional parameters to specify volume_type and availability_zone for the backup-restore API. The volume_type parameter is to specify the volume backend of the restore volume. The availability_zone parameter is to specify the availability_zone where the restore volume would locate in. Thus, user could choose restore volume type according to backup backend and choose restore volume location geographically close to the backup data location. This change will give user more options to ensure restore correctness and enhance restore performance.

When running in an AIO, we need to implement an iptables rule in any
neutron_agent containers to that ensure instances can communicate with
the neutron metadata service. This is necessary because in an AIO
environment there are no physical interfaces involved in instance ->
metadata requests, and this results in the checksums being incorrect.

This is a necessary patch in order to work towards getting rid of the

in place we will be able to set the AIO to activate this code path by
setting 'neutron_metadata_checksum_fix: True' in the AIO's
user_variables.yml, forgoing the needs to implement this in a bash
script.

Backport note:
This is being backported due to the numerous IRC conversations which
we have related to run-playbooks being used multiple times.
Implementing this backport will reduce the number of times we have to
field questions about lost container connectivity.

In order to allow replication sets to be all on the same hypervisor
(affinity) or all on different hypervisors (anti-affinity) a new
argument (locality) needed to be added to the Trove create API.

This changeset addresses the Trove client part of this feature.
A --locality flag is now available on the 'create' command and
is passed to the server for processing.

The --replica_count argument was also cleaned up in that it's not
passed on unless it is set. If --replica_of is specified, the
default is set to '1.'

Developers should use these tox tests to verify that their changes will work when the gate jobs run. Some systems may need additional packages for these tests to run properly. To install all of the prerequisites and run the functional tests, use the ``run_tests.sh`` script: .. code-block:: console ./run_tests.sh .. note:: This script will apply the default security hardening configurations to the local host. Avoid running this script on production servers which have not been properly tested with the security role. Writing documentation --------------------- Each security configuration has corresponding documentation found in ``docs/source/developer-notes``. The documentation should be brief, but it must answer a few critical questions: * What does the change do to a system? * What is the value of making this change? * How can a deployer opt out or opt in for a particular change? * Is there additional documentation available online that may help a deployer decide whether or not this change is valuable to them? Each developer note is stored with the configuration number as its filename. For example, the documentation for V-38476 is stored in ``doc/source/developer-notes/V-38476.rst``. If the developer notes for several security configurations are identical, symbolic links can be used to avoid repeating information. Release notes ------------- Adding release notes helps deployers and other developers discover the new additions to the role in a concise format. Release notes should be added to incoming patches if they would change something noticeable in the role, such as bug fixes, new functionality, or variable name changes. To add a release note, use ``reno``: .. code-block:: console reno new i-made-a-new-feature-that-does-something-awesome Once you run the ``reno new`` command with a release note slug, a new file appears in ``releasenotes/notes``.

There can be issues during database migrations when a column used as a
foreign key is using a different collation between the parent and
child table.

Update the my.cnf template to set the server default collation to
utf8_general_ci to ensure consistency between tables initially
created with and those later altered to use the utf8 character set.

This matches both the instruction from the OpenStack install guide[0],

It is increasingly finding applications in situations that manipulate very large data sets, and where you need ""random, realtime read/write access to your Big Data"". [1] Launchpad Blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/trove/+spec/hbase-support Problem Description =================== This project aims to add support for HBase in Trove. An important part of the Trove value proposition is that a common API, and a common set of abstractions are used to manage a number of different relational, and non-relational database technologies. HBase is a distributed scalable database based on the Hadoop (HDFS) technologies and is commonly used alongside other databases currently supported by Trove like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Cassandra. Therefore there is value in being able to support the deployment, management, and operation of a HBase database through OpenStack Trove. As Trove currently does not support HBase, this project aims to add that support and close this gap. Proposed Change =============== The proposed change aims to add support for HBase in Trove. In keeping with the way in which other database technologies have been added to Trove, support for HBase will be added in phases. The remainder of this section describes the proposed changes first, and describes the phased approach to implementing these changes in Trove. HBase can be operated in one of three modes. These are: - standalone mode - fully distributed mode - partially (or pseudo) distributed mode. Note: the term 'pseudo distributed mode' is the one used by HBase so I will use that. Standalone Mode --------------- In standalone mode, all of HBase runs on a single node and data is stored in a locally attached file system. This is analogous to running a database like MySQL or MongoDB in a single node configuration with data stored on an attached Cinder volume. Fully Distributed Mode ---------------------- In a fully distributed HBase installation, multiple HBase daemons run on multiple servers in a cluster. Data are stored in a fully distributed HDFS file system. The terminology is analogous to the fully distributed Hadoop Cluster. Pseudo Distributed Mode ----------------------- In pseudo distributed mode, all of HBase runs on a single node and data is stored on a Hadoop (HDFS) file system which also runs in pseudo (or partially) distributed mode. In other words, the entire HBase system runs on a single machine but in multiple java processes. For more details about HBase operating modes, refer to [2]. For more details about Hadoop operating modes, refer to [3]. Phased implementation in Trove ------------------------------ It is the stated objective that HBase be added to Trove in a phased manner as described below. +-----------------------------+------------+------------+------------+ | | Phase I | Phase II | Phase III | +-----------------------------+------------+------------+------------+ | Create (Standalone) | X | X | X | | Create (Pseudo Distributed) | X | X | X | | Create (Fully Distributed) | | | X | | Instance Resize | X | X | X | | Disk Resize | X | X | X | | Backup | ? | X | X | | Create (from Backup) | ? | X | X | | Configuration Groups | | X | X | | Cluster resize - Grow | | | X | | Cluster resize - Shrink | | | X | | Python Trove Client (CLI) | X | X | X | | Horizon Interface | | X | X | +-----------------------------+------------+------------+------------+ It is tentatively proposed that Phase 1 will be in the Mitaka release timeframe, Phase II will be in the 'N' release and Phase III will be in the 'O' release. Phase I deliverable ------------------- In the first phase the following will be submitted. 1. Elements to create a guest image for HBase Standalone mode 2. A guest agent for HBase Standalone mode 3. Changes required in the CLI and the controller 4. Unit tests Architecture Overview --------------------- We use the cluster_config parameter to prepare() to indicate the mode to the guest. This is consistent with the way in which other cluster implementations communicate cluster configuration information to the guest. Architecture Overview for Trove and Standalone HBase ---------------------------------------------------- In standalone mode, the architecture of Trove will be identical to a current single node Trove database of any other type (like MySQL). The guest agent and the HBase instance will be on the same VM and the user will have access to HBase but not to ssh on the instance. Architecture Overview for Trove and Pseudo Distributed HBase ------------------------------------------------------------ In pseudo distributed mode, the architecture of Trove will be identical to a current single node Trove database of any other type (like MySQL). The guest agent and the HBase instance will be on the same VM and the user will have access to HBase but not to ssh on the instance. Architecture Overview for trove and Fully Distributed HBase ----------------------------------------------------------- In fully distributed mode, the architecture of Trove will be similar to a current cluster implementation of any other type (like MySQL). The guest agent and the HBase instance will be on the same VM and the user will have access to HBase but not to ssh on the instance. However, should there be specific differences required for HBase in this area, independent specs will be submitted for that. Configuration ------------- There will no doubt be a HBase section in the configuration. It is likely that there will in fact be three sections, one for each operating mode; hbase-standalone, hbase-pseudo-distributed and hbase-fully-distributed. This makes sense because it will facilitate the phased development process but also because it will allow each phase to have configurations only germane to it. This will be analogous to the current situation where we have a [percona] section and a [pxc] section. Database -------- The first two phases; standalone and pseudo distributed should not require any new database constructs. It may be the case that the third phase with fully distributed would require some changes to the database. These are not fully specified at this time. Public API ---------- The expectation is that this implementation will conform to the Trove Public API. The fully distributed configuration may require some extensions to the API but I believe that those could be accomplished with constructs that are now part of the API, for the create() call. The current plan is to implement all hbase creations using the cluster-create method. An option that is still being explored is to use the create method for standalone and cluster-create for pseudo distributed and fully distributed. Public API Security ------------------- No changes. Python API ---------- See above for Public API. CLI (python-troveclient) ------------------------ There will be changes for the fully distributed configuration but those are not fully specified at this time. The standalone and pseudo distributed modes should not have material changes in the CLI. Internal API ------------ There may be additional changes for the fully distributed configuration but those are not fully specified at this time. The standalone and pseudo distributed modes should not have material changes to the internal API's. Guest Agent ----------- Yes, see description(s) above. Alternatives ------------ Several alternatives were considered. 1. Walk away from this and point people to Sahara. This could work for some but there is a serious interest in having a common API for all databases and HBase is a database. Therefore this alternative has been abandoned. An important aspect of the Trove value proposition is the fact that a single API can be used to manage a number of different database types and in the minds of a lot of end-users, HBase is a database. 2. Consider integration of Trove with Sahara. This approach, while attractive has some clear downsides. Considering the perspective of an end user who wishes to establish a single big data and database management abstraction, the value of a single API and a single mechanism for interacting with all datastores is a very attractive one. To a user looking to implement an end-to-end solution from operational databases through a big-data data-lake solution, a single abstraction of Trove is considered to be preferable to the approach of having different datastores using different abstractions. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: amrith Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: Phase-1: Mitaka-3 Phase-2: N release (tentatively) Phase-3: O release (tentatively) Work Items ---------- For Mitaka-1, the work items are as follows. 1. Build guest image elements 2. Build guest image 3. Write guest agent 4. Write unit tests 5. Test standalone and pseudo distributed modes For the subsequent releases, the complete list of work items includes (but this is an incomplete list which will be completed during the appropriate release cycle, along with additional specifications if required). Upgrade Implications ==================== There are no known upgrade implications beyond the normally understood ones. The guest agent has to be upgraded first, before the controller. The new guest agent won't genreate messages not understood by an old controller, and so on. Dependencies ============ None in the first phase of implementation. Testing ======= Will be consistent with the current testing regimen. For Phase 1 and 2, the testing will consist of unit tests and gate tests. Documentation Impact ==================== There will be minimal impact to the documentation in Phase 1 and 2. In Phase 3, the impact will be more significant including listing how the user describes a multi-node configuration that is to be orchestrated. References ========== ..

Both 'manila list --all-tenants' and 'manila list --public'
should show column Project ID. Project/Tenant ownership of
shares is vital information, e.g. when working with project
quota allocations.

'manila list' doesn't show public shares of other projects.
Without '--all-tenants' and without '--public' the result

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================================= Making manila share networks AZ (availability zone) aware ========================================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/manila/+spec/share-network-multiple-subnets Manila can be deployed with a driver that handles the creation and management of share servers. In such a deployment, tenants create share networks by specifying network information from either nova-network or neutron. If the share driver is configured accordingly, the share server will be created with network information from the specified share network. This network information includes the IP addresses for the share server creation which reflect in the export locations of shares created by such drivers. If the share driver is configured with a standalone network or with a ``single`` network configuration [1], the share server is created with the network details from the ``manila.conf`` file. Network information from the tenant specified share network are currently ignored in this case. There is future work envisioned to provide network tunneling and hence, connectivity between the configured and tenant specified networks in such cases. The tenant currently creates a single share network per share and then associates it with a security service. Problem description =================== When share replication [2] was designed in the mitaka release of OpenStack, we decided to make replication work within and across availability zones. However, this feature was limited only to drivers with pre-configured share servers (``DHSS = False`` mode). We realized that we could not support replication of shares created with drivers that support share server handling without making changes to the design of share networks. With share replication, we recommended the use of availability zones as **failure domains** within an OpenStack cloud. ``manila-share`` services would be run across different availability zones when share replication is used for disaster recovery workloads. Tenants would create their primary share in one availability zone and replicas in different availability zones. Therefore, share servers that are created to handle and export these shares need to be created within respective availability zones. Use Cases ========= Availability zones are used across other OpenStack services, such as nova and cinder as a way of logically partitioning resources within an OpenStack deployment. The partitioning can be motivated by the fact that these resources are meant for a particular task, or because they are co-located. However, the most common criteria is because these resources are connected to a common power source or associated with any common point of failure. In the mitaka release of OpenStack, neutron added support to availability zones [3][4]. With this, it is effectively possible for users to allocate network resources to availability zones for high availability. Share networks are an important resource that would need to support being brought up within availability zones. An important tenant driven use case is for share replication. However, this would be useful in further use cases of share networks. Proposed change =============== - Share networks will span multiple availability zones. - Users need to pick the share network (and optionally an AZ) during share creation. They only need to pick the AZ during share replica creation. - This ensures that a single share network is associated with a particular share. - Security service associations would also remain per share network. Allowing share networks to span AZs ----------------------------------- Changes to share network creation --------------------------------- Adding multiple AZs to share networks ------------------------------------- How share servers will be associated with share networks -------------------------------------------------------- Handling network mismatches between creation and driver configuration --------------------------------------------------------------------- Alternatives ------------ Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- - End users will have to specify an availability zone parameter during share network creation unless they would like to use the default availability zone from ``manila.conf``. - End users would have to add new subnets to an existing network iteratively to extend the share network across AZs. Performance impact ------------------ The share server creation will take longer since manila needs to wait for the neutron port to become active. This can be enhanced later, e.g. by introducing multi-processing and proceeding with share server creation like Nova is doing. Other deployer impact --------------------- * No new configuration options are expected to be added. However, neutron performs AZ validation when tenants create networks with availability_zone_hints. Deployers must ensure that neutron services are running in the desired availability_zones to allow for the network creation to succeed. * All existing share networks will be assigned the default availability zone during the database upgrade. Developer impact ---------------- None Driver impact ------------- None. Drivers must be agnostic to all these changes since they will affect the API and the share manager services. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: gouthamr Other contributors: * yogesh * bswartz Work Items ---------- * Introducing share network instances in the database and mapping availability zones. * Changes to share network APIs - create, list, modify * CLI implementation * manila-ui support Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= Unit test coverage will be added/maintained as per community standards. Tempest tests will be modified/added to cover new share network API changes. AZ awareness will be coded into the tests, with fall-backs like the share replication tempest tests. Setting up multiple AZs on the gate is not in the scope of this work. However, these tests will be run manually with multi-AZ configurations. Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation for new configuration switches and possible deployment types.

Without this patch, any errors that happen during the
'apt-get update' execution will cause the 'apt-get install'
execution to never happen.

This patch implements the following:

- It sets the cache prep script to exit on error to ensure
  that the task fails if there is an error.

- It splits the upgrade and install command on to different
  lines to ensure that each command's success can be
  determined individually.

- It removes the clearing of the archive metadata introduced
  in https://review.openstack.org/310091 as this also removes
  apt lock files and other things which should not be removed.
  Removing all this is unnecessary with the new cache prep
  process and the 'apt-get clean' execution later clears the
  cache before it is packaged.

- It removes the copy of /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ from the host
  to prevent a situation where a host apt source requires
  additional packages to be installed (for example curl) and
  those packages can't be installed due to the 'apt-get update'
  command failing because the package to update the index is
  missing.

This changes the run playbooks script so that its using our core CLI
tools and is no longer a special case script running bits outside of
simply running the deployment tools as they've been designed.

The script is still executing all of the playbooks using the
""scripts-library"" function ``install_bits`` so that we ensure gate
success by having a retry on a playbook execution in the case of transient
failure.

A notice has been added to the script whenever it exits notifying
the deployer that they should now work out of the playbooks directory
and never execute the run-playbooks.sh script ever again. Within the
notice links to our documentation have been added.

The ironic services were removed from the integrated gate because they're
not ready for general consumption and not being tested at this time because
no test configuration has been added into the tempest role or the
``run-tempest.sh`` script.

As per current arcitecture, we need to add a CLI wrapper each time
in order to encounter existance of that python client CLI.

As we can see that there is a large number of copy paste of code.

This patch adds a generic method 'command' which will be called same
as other CLI wrappers.

In this method we will pass ""CLI command as a first argument"" and
thus this will eliminate copy paster operations.

Other existing CLI wrappers (nova/neutron/cinder etc.) in same file
will continue to exist until functional CLI tests in python client
repo is modified accordingly.

Once individual client functional tests will be modified, these cli
wrappers will be treated as dead code and will be removed.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============== Static actions ============== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/murano/+spec/static-actions Currently Murano provides a way to invoke MuranoPL methods through the actions API. However it doesn't cover all the use cases where one may want to expose some MuranoPL code. This specification further improves the idea of actions. Problem description =================== Existing actions approach has a number of limitations: * Only instance methods can be exposed as actions. In other words you need to have a class instance in order to call a method on it. And instance means it has to be a part of object model. This makes impossible to expose MuranoPL code that doesn't operate on object model or even produces it like factory methods; * Actions are always asynchronous; * Actions bring large overhead and complexity for simple methods. For each action call a database record is created and never deleted then. All action results are persisted as well; * No two actions in the same environment can be called simultaneously. All of above is not a problem for regular application actions that usually involve deployment steps and can take long time to complete. However it makes actions be a bad choice in case when I just want to expose some application code to outside to keep all of my code in MuranoPL in single place. Proposed change =============== In order to overcome above issues it is proposed to add ability to expose and call static MuranoPL methods through new API and engine RPC calls. Because the methods are static they are not bound to any object model (environment) and thus can be called simultaneously. Also because static methods cannot deploy anything (because they don't have Environment instance which holds the Heat stack and required by most of IaaS resource representing classes) there is no need to make them asynchronous, create database records etc. Also because now there are two types of action methods (static and instance) the fact that method need to be exposed cannot be expressed with the Usage attribute of the method (static methods already have `Usage: Static`). We could introduce yet another usage (e.g. `StaticAction`). But because action means that regular MuranoPL method need to be exposed to outside and it has much more to do with a method visibility rather then its usage it is proposed to introduce another method keyword to declare its scope. Thus current syntax for the action declaration :: methodName: Usage: Action will become :: methodName: Scope: Public and static actions will be declared as :: methodName: Usage: Static Scope: Public `Scope` attribute must be one of the two possible values: * `Session` - regular method that is accessible from anywhere in the current execution session. This is the default if the attribute is omitted; * `Public` - accessible anywhere, both within the session and from outside through the API call (i.e. it is an action in current terminology). In the future new scopes might be added to further restrict the access to the method (e.g. `Package`, `Class`) For backward compatibility `Usage: Action` should remain valid and acceptable but be deprecated for future format versions. Alternatives ------------ * Use actions instead for cases where static methods will be more appropriate; * Declare static actions with yet another Usage value. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- **POST /actions** Execute static MuranoPL method.

Before when we filter out deployment tasks history all the difference
between tasks graph snapshot and filter result was returned as surrogate tasks
with no run name and node.
The deployment tasks history is saved for dry run as well.

There are no test changes as all new code is tested by the
extension_info functional tests, and should we want to eliminate the
extension_info portion of our API later, new tests would just make
this much harder to tear down.

This modifies default policy to drop os-disk-config as well as
modifying extension tests to pass even though we're injecting

1) Remove testr config file & requirments
2) Add pytest requirments
3) Change tox.ini to use pytest instead of testr

To add parameters to py.test you should add -- and than all args.

A command which prints failed resources in the stack to help debug
stack issues.

Failed resources are added by recursing from the top level stack into
failed nested stack resources. A failed nested stack resource is only
added to the failed list if it contains no failed resources so that the
user only sees root-cause failed resources.

As an added convenience to debugging deployment resources, deployment
outputs deploy_stdout and deploy_stderr are printed as well (the full
outputs are printed when --long is specified).

The output is a yamlish format where the key is a dot-delimited resource
name path and the value is a dict of resource information.

This reverts commit 592d034202c36b096251cf9f80ece75bbe551a7d.
We're unable to fix a failing migration by adding a new one later in the chain.
Also as I explained in change id  I15a864dd1ad18aa1b3e3ff7fe511405d62a119cc,
that change will not do harm because we have 0 Cinder deployments that
aren't having all the tables created as UTF-8.

VIFOpenVSwitch vifs will be booted by libvirt directly on the target
bridge. Don't create an extraneous linux bridge with a veth pair
connection to the target bridge.

VIFOpenVSwitch inherits from VIFBridge, so the following check causes
_plug_bridge() to be incorrectly executed for vifs of type
VIFOpenVSwitch:

    if isinstance(vif, objects.vif.VIFBridge):
        self._plug_bridge(vif, instance_info)

Fix this to check for instances of VIFOpenVSwitch first and do nothing
in that case.

This was mostly only an artifact of tempest being the only proven pattern for doing this, not an artifact of a design decision. However, moving forward as functional testing is being spun up in each individual project we really only want tempest to be the integration test suite it was intended to be; testing the high level interactions between projects through REST API requests. In this model there are probably existing tests that aren't the best fit living in tempest. However, since tempest is largely still the only gating test suite in this space we can't carelessly rip out everything from the tree. This document outlines the procedure which was developed to ensure we minimize the risk for removing something of value from the tempest tree. This procedure might seem overly conservative and slow paced, but this is by design to try and ensure we don't remove something that is actually providing value. Having potential duplication between testing is not a big deal especially compared to the alternative of removing something which is actually providing value and is actively catching bugs, or blocking incorrect patches from landing. Proposing a test removal ------------------------ 3 prong rule for removal ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ In the proposal etherpad we'll be looking for answers to 3 questions #. The tests proposed for removal must have equiv. coverage in a different project's test suite (whether this is another gating test project, or an in tree funcitonal test suite) For API tests preferably the other project will have a similar source of friction in place to prevent breaking api changes so that we don't regress and let breaking api changes slip through the gate. #. The test proposed for removal has a failure rate < 0.50% in the gate over the past release (the value and interval will likely be adjusted in the future) #. There must not be an external user/consumer of tempest that depends on the test proposed for removal The answers to 1 and 2 are easy to verify. For 1 just provide a link to the new test location. If you are linking to the tempest removal patch please also put a Depends-On in the commit message for the commit which moved the test into another repo. For prong 2 you can use OpenStack-Health: Using OpenStack-Health """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Go to: http://status.openstack.org/openstack-health and then navigate to a per test page for six months. You'll end up with a page that will graph the success and failure rates on the bottom graph. For example, something like: http://status.openstack.org/openstack-health/#/test/tempest.scenario.test_volume_boot_pattern.TestVolumeBootPatternV2.test_volume_boot_pattern?groupKey=project&resolutionKey=day&duration=P6M The Old Way using subunit2sql directly """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" SELECT * from tests where test_id like ""%test_id%""; (where $test_id is the full test_id, but truncated to the class because of setupclass or teardownclass failures) You can access the infra mysql subunit2sql db w/ read-only permissions with: * hostname: logstash.openstack.org * username: query * password: query * db_name: subunit2sql For example if you were trying to remove the test with the id: tempest.api.compute.admin.test_flavors_negative.FlavorsAdminNegativeTestJSON.test_get_flavor_details_for_deleted_flavor you would run the following: #. run: ""mysql -u query -p -h logstash.openstack.org subunit2sql"" to connect to the subunit2sql db #. run the query: MySQL [subunit2sql]> select * from tests where test_id like ""tempest.api.compute.admin.test_flavors_negative.FlavorsAdminNegativeTestJSON%""; which will return a table of all the tests in the class (but it will also catch failures in setupClass and tearDownClass) #. paste the output table with numbers and the mysql command you ran to generate it into the etherpad. Eventually a cli interface will be created to make that a bit more friendly. Also a dashboard is in the works so we don't need to manually run the command. The intent of the 2nd prong is to verify that moving the test into a project specific testing is preventing bugs (assuming the tempest tests were catching issues) from bubbling up a layer into tempest jobs. If we're seeing failure rates above a certain threshold in the gate checks that means the functional testing isn't really being effective in catching that bug (and therefore blocking it from landing) and having the testing run in tempest still has value. However for the 3rd prong verification is a bit more subjective. The original intent of this prong was mostly for refstack/defcore and also for things that running on the stable branches. We don't want to remove any tests if that would break our api consistency checking between releases, or something that defcore/refstack is depending on being in tempest. It's worth pointing out that if a test is used in defcore as part of interop testing then it will probably have continuing value being in tempest as part of the integration/integrated tests in general. This is one area where some overlap is expected between testing in projects and tempest, which is not a bad thing. Discussing the 3rd prong """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" There are 2 approaches to addressing the 3rd prong. Either it can be raised during a qa meeting during the tempest discussion. Please put it on the agenda well ahead of the scheduled meeting. Since the meeting time will be well known ahead of time anyone who depends on the tests will have ample time beforehand to outline any concerns on the before the meeting. To give ample time for people to respond to removal proposals please add things to the agend by the Monday before the meeting. The other option is to raise the removal on the openstack-dev mailing list. (for example see: http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-February/086218.html ) This will raise the issue to the wider community and attract at least the same (most likely more) attention than discussing it during the irc meeting. The only downside is that it might take more time to get a response, given the nature of ML. Exceptions to this procedure ---------------------------- For the most part all tempest test removals have to go through this procedure there are a couple of exceptions though: #. The class of testing has been decided to be outside the scope of tempest. #. A revert for a patch which added a broken test, or testing which didn't actually run in the gate (basically any revert for something which shouldn't have been added) For the first exception type the only types of testing in tree which have been declared out of scope at this point are: * The CLI tests (which should be completely removed at this point) * Neutron Adv. Services testing (which should be completely removed at this point) * XML API Tests (which should be completely removed at this point) * EC2 API/boto tests (which should be completely removed at this point) For tests that fit into this category the only criteria for removal is that there is equivalent testing elsewhere. Tempest Scope ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Also starting in the liberty cycle tempest has defined a set of projects which are defined as in scope for direct testing in tempest. As of today that list is: * Keystone * Nova * Glance * Cinder * Neutron * Swift anything that lives in tempest which doesn't test one of these projects can be removed assuming there is equivalent testing elsewhere. Preferably using the `tempest plugin mechanism`_ to mantain continuity after migrating the tests out of tempest .. _tempest plugin mechanism: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tempest/plugin.html ",,169,0

It will create a tag for the last release mentioned in the file(s). You can point it to specific YAML files, or to a local git repository (in which case it will look at the files modified in the most recent commit). Examples: :: ./release_from_yaml.sh ../openstack-releases deliverables/mitaka/nova.yaml Call release.sh for all repositories mentioned in the last release added to ../openstack-releases/deliverables/mitaka/nova.yaml :: ./release_from_yaml.sh ../openstack-releases Look into the git repository at ../openstack-releases for deliverable YAML files modified at the last commit, and call release.sh for all repositories mentioned on the last release in each such file. release.sh ========== This script creates a tag on a given repository SHA and pushes it to Gerrit. Additionally it will add a message on Launchpad bugs that are mentioned as ""closed"" in git commit messages since the last tag on the same series. Example: :: ./release.sh openstack/oslo.rootwrap mitaka 3.0.3 gerrit/master Apply a 3.0.3 tag (associated to the mitaka series) to the gerrit master HEAD of the openstack/oslo.rootwrap reporitory, and add a comment for each closed bug mentioned in commit messages since the previous mitaka tag (3.0.2). branch_from_yaml.sh =================== This script looks at the deliverable files to decide how to create stable branches. :: $ branch_from_yaml.sh ~/repos/openstack/releases mitaka $ branch_from_yaml.sh ~/repos/openstack/releases mitaka $ branch_from_yaml.sh ~/repos/openstack/releases mitaka deliverables/_independent/openstack-ansible.yaml ",,60,0

In common the first step to debugging a OpenStack bug always be reproduction.
But many times, logs doesn't contains enougth information, like what local
variables is, what the exception type and value is. Which make reproduction
more difficult. This blueprint introduces the first step to address this issue.

Compared with log_handler, this handler reports more detail informations
about exceptions which includes context local variables, and all frame
details.

The `publisher_id` of notification is the hostname of the real publisher,
to make notifications consumers easy to find out which host is in danger.

The `event_type` of notification is set to 'exception_notification' to
distinguish from another log_handler.

The schema of notification's payload looks like below:

Logging notification handlers will calling notifier to emit notifications.
when combines with log notifier, which on the contrary calls this logging
handler to do logging logic, then logging handler want to notify ......
so results in infinite looping.

To make publish_errors work with log notifier, introduce a decoration
to restrict the maximum recursion of a method. Achieve this by looking
up target method through the whole calling stack, if too much calling
happend, stop it. Also includes tests to make sure the decoration work.

The decoration also prevent bug like #1346466 resulting in infinite
error looping.

Now cinder can update user metadata by updating
volume_metadata API and updateing volume API.

But updating volume API misses the checking of
metadata properites, that will cause 500 error
if metadata value is larger than 255 characters.

Fix this bug by adding _check_metadata_properties.

osc-lib is a package of common support modules for writing
OSC plugins. All common functions, classes such as exceptions,

The change I04d1c99df9983733b6d2579ba71097b2cebc6a54 has got
rid of the last global leaked mocks in the test code.
We can now run the mock detector only once after each test class.

Aside from reducing the job runtime this also has an additional
benefit of being able to detect global mock references that
could not be caught before because they exist both before and after
the test run and hence do not show up in the difference.

Several places were doing things between when a cached resource was
changed and when the cache was invalidated, which could lead to
problems, e.g. if the code in between the two raised an exception,
or if an audit event resulted in the resource being requeried before
the cache was invalidated. Review comments on the original patch also
pointed out that audit events would not be sent in some exeption cases.

This change does cache invalidation as quickly as possible after a
change and uses try/finally logic to ensure that audit events will
be sent even in exception cases.

It also removes a stale TODO and an unnecessary duplicate assignment
removal in the affected code.
