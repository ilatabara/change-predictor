tox4 even when running specific env with -e option tries
to find python version for all envs defined in envlist[1]
when running with --skip-missing-interpreters=false and
fails if interpreter missing for any of the env.

With py38 in envlist it tries to find python3.8

to handle it.

Even though [1] is fixed we are still seeing this failure.

On a recent change [1], some additional checks was added to avoid
ports overlapping cidrs on a router. On this change was also added
a check to do not attach more than one port IPv6 from same network,
but this check need to allow multiple ports when a deployment is
done using ml2/ovs+xvlan+dvr and the router has an external gateway
configured, because two ports are added:

- one with device_owner as network:router_interface_distributed
- another one with device_owner as network:router_centralized_snat

Also an small improvement is done for just run this check over the
existing ports on the router for the same network_id.

If the event is called before the ""OVNMechanismDriver""'s ""OVNClient""

Bulk port create without mac address fails as when Neutron calls
oslo_utils.netutils.get_ipv6_addr_by_EUI64, as the mac field of the port
is an ATTR_NOT_SPECIFIED Sentinel() object.
With some reshuffling of the code to fill the mac field this can be
fixed.

When running in check mode, some prechecks previously failed because
they use the command module which is silently not run in check mode.
Other prechecks were not running correctly in check mode due to e.g.
looking for a string in empty command output or not querying which
containers are running.

This change fixes these issues.

Most other configuration entries are optional, see below. ======== These example device configuration snippets are assumed to be part to a specific file ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_genericswitch.ini``, but they could also be added directly to ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini``. Here is an example for the Cisco 300 series device::General configuration ===================== Physical networks need to be declared in the ML2 config as well, with a range of VLANs that can be allocated to tenant networks. Several physical networks can coexist, possibly with overlapping VLAN ranges: in that case, each switch configuration needs to include its physical network, see :ref:`physicalnetworks`. Example of ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini`` with two physical networks:: [ml2_type_vlan] network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:700:799,physnet2:600:850 For a given physical network, it is possible to specify several disjoint ranges of VLANs by simply repeating the physical network name multiple times:: [ml2_type_vlan] network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:700:720,physnet1:750:760 (Re)start ``neutron-server`` specifying the additional configuration file containing switch configuration::To stop networking generic switch trying to add or remove VLANs on the switch, administrator are expected to pre-add all enabled VLANs as well as tagging these VLANs on trunk ports. Once those VLANs and trunk ports are preconfigured on the switch, you can use the following configuration to stop networking generic switch adding or removing any VLANs:: Trunk ports =========== When VLANs are created on the switches, it is common to want to tag these VLANS on one or more trunk ports. To do this, you need to declare a comma-separated list of trunk ports that can be managed by Networking Generic Switch. It will then dynamically tag and untag VLANs on these ports whenever it creates and deletes VLANs. For example:: [genericswitch:device-hostname] ngs_trunk_ports = Ethernet1/48, Port-channel1 This is useful when managing several switches in the same physical network, because they are likely to be interconnected with trunk links. Another important use-case is to connect the DHCP agent with a trunk port, because the agent needs access to all active VLANs. Note that this option is only used if ``ngs_manage_vlans = True``. .. _physicalnetworks: Multiple physical networks ========================== It is possible to use Networking Generic Switch to manage several physical networks. The desired physical network is selected by the Neutron API client when it creates the network object. In this case, you may want to only create VLANs on switches that belong to the requested physical network, especially because VLAN ranges from separate physical networks may overlap. This also improves reconfiguration performance because fewer switches will need to be configured whenever a network is created/deleted. To this end, each switch can be configured with a list of physical networks it belongs to:: [genericswitch:device-hostname] ngs_physical_networks = physnet1, physnet2 Physical network names should match the names defined in the ML2 configuration. If no physical network is declared in a switch configuration, then VLANs for all physical networks will be created on this switch. Note that this option is only used if ``ngs_manage_vlans = True``. ","-------- Here is an example of ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_genericswitch.ini`` for the Cisco 300 series device:: ...

is affecting this conditional evaluation.

As this conditional way was used in several places, this
patch aims also to change those places to look alike.

For example, the server may have NVMe devices attached to a RAID controller which could be in pass-through or single disk volume mode. The same scenario exists basically regardless of the disk/storage medium/type. The basic reason why is that RAID controllers essentially act as command translators with a buffer cache. They tend to offer a simplified protocol to the Operating System, and interact with the storage device in whatever protocol is native to the device. This is the root of the underlying problem. Protocols such as SCSI are rooted in quite a bit of computing history, but never evolved to include primitives like Secure Erase which evolved in the `ATA protocol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA#HDD_passwords_and_security>`_. The closest primitives in SCSI to ATA Secure Erase is the ``FORMAT UNIT`` and ``UNMAP`` commands. ``FORMAT UNIT`` might be a viable solution, and a tool named `sg_format <https://linux.die.net/man/8/sg_format>`_ exists, but there has not been a sufficient call upstream to implement this and test it sufficiently that the Ironic community would be comfortable shipping such a capability. The possibility also exists that a RAID controller might not translate this command through to an end device, just as some RAID controllers know how to handle and pass through ATA commands to disk devices which support them. It is entirely dependent upon the hardware configuration scenario. The ``UNMAP`` command is similar to the ATA ``TRIM`` command. Unfortunately the SCSI protocol requires this be performed at block level, and similar to ``FORMAT UNIT``, it may not be supported or just passed through. If your interested in working on this area, or are willing to help test, please feel free to contact the `Ironic development community </ironic/latest/contributor/community>`_. One last item of note, depending on the RAID controller, the BMC, and a number of other variables, you may be able to leverage the `RAID <raid>`_ configuration interface to delete volumes/disks, and recreate them. This may have the same effect as a clean disk, however that too is RAID controller dependent behavior.",,47,0

For autoscaling granularity is set to 60 and the heat
stack is expected to scale out after instance reaches
CPU utilization higher than 10%.

According to this configuration the cpu time must be
10**9*60*(10/100) which is 6000000000 ns.

The default threshold for aodh alarms is ""10000000""

This patch [1] introduced checking whether the CONF.dns.nameservers
is empty. If the CONF.dns.nameservers value is empty then the
initialization of the QueryClient fails. This change makes the majority
of designate-tempest-plugin tests fail even tests that do not use the
QueryClient.

This patch introduces three changes:

1) ValueError is raised only when the query() function is called so
   that only tests that actually use the query() function fail.

2) wait_for_query() function is fixed so that it never succeeds when the
   CONF.dns.nameservers value is empty.

3) Skip tests that rely upon [dns].nameserver value.

Verbose logging is desirable to ensure INFO level logging is fed back to

Improve logic for making systemd mount dependent on
network-online.target when network filesystem is being used.

This change improves feature implemented in commit [1].

Currently when device is specified by UUID or LABEL, dependency for
network-online.target is added even it's not a network filesystem.
We should be careful with this as it may create circular dependency.
In my case, circular dependency looked like this:

network.target ->
  network-pre.target ->
    netfilter-persistent.service ->
      local-fs.target ->
        var-lib-nova.mount ->
          network-online.target ->
            network.target

Additionally, this commit was originally supposed to add dependency also
for CIFS mounts(these ones starting from '//') but it never worked in my
opinion. It was also fixed by this change.

In this release cycle, a few services are enabling the
enforce scope and new defaults by default. Example Nova:
- https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/nova/+/866218)

Until the new defaults enalbing by default is not released we
should keep testing the old defaults in existing jobs and we can
add new jobs testing new defautls. To do that we can provide the
way in devstack to keep scope/new defaults disable by default which
can be enabled by setting enforce_scope variable to true.

Once any service release the new defaults enabled by default then
we can switch the bhavior, enable the scope/new defaults by default
and a single job can disbale them to keep testing the old defaults
until service does not remove those.

A combination of durable queues and classic queue mirroring can be used
to provide high availability of RabbitMQ. However, these options should
only be used together, otherwise the system will become unstable. Using
the flag ``om_enable_rabbitmq_high_availability`` will either enable
both options at once, or neither of them.

There are some queues that should not be mirrored:
* ``reply`` queues (these have a single consumer and TTL policy)
* ``fanout`` queues (these have a TTL policy)
* ``amq`` queues (these are auto-delete queues, with a single consumer)
An exclusionary pattern is used in the classic mirroring policy. This
pattern is ``^(?!(amq\\.)|(.*_fanout_)|(reply_)).*``

When a user is prevented from listing a non-public
share, the API service would return a 403 Forbidden.
This isn't consistent with the API SIG's guidance
on resources restricted by virtue of RBAC policy since
users with malicious intent may use the signal to
mean that the resource exists.

Improve logic for making systemd mount dependent on
network-online.target when network filesystem is being used.

This change improves feature implemented in commit [1].

Currently when device is specified by UUID or LABEL, dependency for
network-online.target is added even it's not a network filesystem.
We should be careful with this as it may create circular dependency.
In my case, circular dependency looked like this:

network.target ->
  network-pre.target ->
    netfilter-persistent.service ->
      local-fs.target ->
        var-lib-nova.mount ->
          network-online.target ->
            network.target

Additionally, this commit was originally supposed to add dependency also
for CIFS mounts(these ones starting from '//') but it never worked in my
opinion. It was also fixed by this change.

The qos_policy_id attribute was not applied to the new VRRP ports
created after the failover of a load balancer.

This commit adds 2 things:
- The qos_policy_id is applied to the VIP port: this adds consistency
  with the VRRP ports, it doesn't do anything on this port because it is
  not used but the attributes of this port are used to create the VRRP
  port in the failover flow.
- The allocate_vip function of the allowed_address_pairs driver sets the
  qos_policy_id when creating a port if it is set for the VIP object.

Improve logic for making systemd mount dependent on
network-online.target when network filesystem is being used.

This change improves feature implemented in commit [1].

Currently when device is specified by UUID or LABEL, dependency for
network-online.target is added even it's not a network filesystem.
We should be careful with this as it may create circular dependency.
In my case, circular dependency looked like this:

network.target ->
  network-pre.target ->
    netfilter-persistent.service ->
      local-fs.target ->
        var-lib-nova.mount ->
          network-online.target ->
            network.target

Additionally, this commit was originally supposed to add dependency also
for CIFS mounts(these ones starting from '//') but it never worked in my
opinion. It was also fixed by this change.

This patch looks huge, so let's split things in the following listing:

- rename role to match the naming convention
  - role name shouldn't get hyphen, so let's use underscores instead.
    Playbooks don't need to follow this rule.

This should make the role more portable in the future.

- modify role
  - ""disable"" the main.yml - we must call specific task file.
  - no more condioned deploy based on variables. Makes it easier to
    follow and maintain.
  - update how the edpm inventory is edited
    - use plain YAML
    - output plain YAML
    - this format is consistent with latest changes in tripleo-ansible[1]

These changes make the overall role easier to understand and maintain,
while ensuring the playbook is also easier to read. It may also make the
deploy a bit faster with the new way to run the various tasks.

- update playbook
  - boostrap both nodes in a 2-stages way (check comment as to why).
  - deploy compute from the undercloud (mimic what an operator would do)
  - validate the compute from the undercloud (no actual change here)
  - target specific task_file during the different stages. It's easier
    to understand what's going on in there

These changes should allow a better understanding of the overall playbook.

- update edpm deploy script to use an environment file instead of CLI
  params
  - this makes the script lighter and easier to understand
  - adding new parameters in the env file is easier
  - reading the env file for debugging is better

Problem description =================== For guests with more than one NUMA node, a NIC connected as a PCIe device is tied to one NUMA node. However, the current nova implementation does not provide this information to the guest. Therefore, as shown below, sysfs returns -1 [1]_ to indicate unknown:: root@guest:~# cat /sys/class/net/enp2s0/device/numa_node -1 Use Cases --------- This information is very important in tuning [2]_ for NICs with 100 Gbps or higher bandwidth to avoid interconnect communications between NUMA nodes such as QPI (Quick Path Interconnect) and UPI (Ultra Path Interconnect). Proposed change =============== The NUMA information for a PCIe device is determined by the bus to which the device is connected, not by the device itself. In the current nova implementation, all devices are connected to the Root Bus, which has no NUMA information, so NUMA information is omitted. This blueprint solves this by adding a PXB (PCIe Expander Bus) for each NUMA node as a bus with NUMA information [3]_ [4]_. For example, the PXB for node 0 is as follows:: <controller type='pci' index='4' model='pcie-expander-bus'> <model name='pxb-pcie'/> <target busNr='254'> <node>0</node> </target> <alias name='pci.4'/> <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x03' function='0x0'/> PCIe devices are connected to PXB via the PCIe Root Port. This means that when adding a new PCIe device, a paired PCIe Root Port must be generated and mediate between the device and the PXB. The association between a PCIe device and a PCIe Root Port is done by the index and bus number in the Libvirt Guest Config. The same mechanism is used to link a PCIe Root Port to a PXB. For example, in an environment with two NUMA nodes, each with two NICs connected to it, it can be illustrated as follows:: ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │pcie-root (index=0) │ │ │ │ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ ▲ │ │pcie-expander-bus (index=1, numa node=0) │ │ │ │ │ ┌───────────────────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │pcie-root-port (index=2, bus=1)│ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌───────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │pcie-device (bus=2)│ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └───────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ NUMA node 0 │ │ └───────────────────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ ┌───────────────────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │pcie-root-port (index=3, bus=1)│ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌───────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │pcie-device (bus=3)│ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └───────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ └───────────────────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ ▼ │ │ │ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ ▲ │ │pcie-expander-bus (index=4, numa node=1) │ │ │ │ │ ┌───────────────────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │pcie-root-port (index=5, bus=4)│ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌───────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │pcie-device (bus=5)│ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └───────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ └───────────────────────────────┘ │ │ │ NUMA node 1 │ │ ┌───────────────────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │pcie-root-port (index=6, bus=4)│ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌───────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │pcie-device (bus=6)│ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └───────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ └───────────────────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ ▼ │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘ As a result, NUMA information can be obtained from the guest. Other devices that do not have NUMA information are not covered by this mechanism:: root@guest:~# lspci -tv # pass-through NIC linked to PXB -+-[0000:fe]---00.0-[ff]----00.0 Intel Corporation Ethernet Virtual ... # other devices \-[0000:00]-+-00.0 Intel Corporation 82G33/G31/P35/P31 Express DRAM ... +-01.0 Red Hat, Inc.

For general PCIe devices, we will address this in the future. .. note:: Since PXB is only supported on ``x86_64/q35``, this proposal has similar limitations. .. note:: PCI-NUMA affinity policies in scheduling has already been implemented in Nova [6]_. This proposal does not affect scheduling but is intended to give additional information to guests. Index Numbering --------------- The index used in the Libvirt Guest Config has the following characteristics: #. The index must be unique in the Libvirt Guest Config #. The index must satisfy 1. not only when creating a new guest, but also when performing hot-plug or hot-unplug operations on PCIe devices #. The index 0 is reserved for Root Bus Since Nova already has a parser for Libvirt Guest Config, it can satisfy these by obtaining the largest index in use.

Problem description =================== When booting a guest with 1TB+ RAM, the default physical address bits are too small and the boot fails [1]_. So a knob is needed to specify the appropriate physical address bits. Use Cases --------- Booting a guest with large RAM. Proposed change =============== In Libvirt v8.7.0 and later, physical address bits can be specified with following XML elements [2]_ [3]_. The former means to adopt any physical address bits, the latter means to adopt the physical address bits of the host CPU. - ``<maxphysaddr mode='emulate' bits='42'/>`` - ``<maxphysaddr mode='passthrough'/>`` Here I suggest the following two flavor extra_specs. Of course, if these are omitted, the behavior is the same as before. - ``hw:maxphysaddr_mode`` can be either ``emulate`` or ``passthrough``. - ``hw:maxphysaddr_bits`` takes a positive integer value. Only meaningful and must be specified if ``hw:maxphysaddr_mode=emulate``. Also I suggest the two equivalent options as image properties, as shown below: - ``hw_maxphysaddr_mode`` - ``hw_maxphysaddr_bits`` Alternatives ------------ Before the ``maxphysaddr`` option was introduced into Libvirt, it was specified as a workaround with the QEMU comanndline parameter. There is no particular reason to use this method currently. For adopting any value for physical address bits:: <qemu:commandline> <qemu:arg value='-cpu'/> <qemu:arg value='qemu64,phys-bits=42'/> </qemu:commandline> For adopting physical address bits of host CPU:: <qemu:commandline> <qemu:arg value='-cpu'/> <qemu:arg value='host,host-phys-bits=on'/> </qemu:commandline> Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- Operators should specify appropriate image properties and/or flavor extra_specs as needed. Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: nmiki Other contributors: None Feature Liaison --------------- Feature liaison: Liaison Needed Work Items ---------- * Add new guest configs * Add new fileds in nova/api/validation/extra_specs/hw.py * Add new fields in ImageMetaProps * Add docs and release notes for new flavor extra_specs and image properties Dependencies ============ Libivrt v8.7.0+. Testing ======= Add the following unit tests: - check that flavor extra_specs and image properties are properly validated - check that intended XML elements are output Documentation Impact ==================== For operators, the documentation describes what these flavor extra_specs and image properties mean and how they should be set.

are used or not, so item['interface'] is always accessed.

This patch aims to check for the key's presence before performing
ternary operations, or use Ansible variables to postpone evaluation

Previously Nova was unable to remove deleted projects from flavor's
access lists. This patch lifts described limitation and improves
logic of nova/api/openstack/identity.py library by introducing two
separate kinds of exceptions:

- webob.exc.HTTPInternalServerError is raised when Keystone identity
  service version 3.0 was not found.
- webob.exc.HTTPBadRequest is raised when specified project is not
  found.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================================= VNC console support for Ironic driver ========================================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/ironic-vnc-console The feature aims at providing a vnc console from Ironic. Problem description =================== End users often have to troubleshoot their instances because they might have broken their boot configuration or locked themselves out with a firewall. Keyboard-Video-Mouse (KVM) access is often required for troubleshooting these types of issues as serial access is not always available or correctly configured. Also, KVM provides a better user experience as compared to serial console. Currently, ironic does not expose a node's KVM capabilities. As such, admin users and deployers have to find alternatives to provide KVM access to their users. Also, Horizon's VNC console is not supported for the ironic nodes provisioned by Nova. Use Cases --------- The end user will be able to get workable vnc console url from baremetal server by command ""openstack console url show --novnc"" Proposed change =============== * the Ironic virt driver will have to implement ``get_vnc_console`` and return a ``ctype.ConsoleVNC`` with the required connection information. Will raise ConsoleTypeUnavailable if vnc console is unavailable for the instance * One new field will be added to the ``console_auth_tokens`` table: ``password`` - password for vnc console. it is stored on ironic side ``driver_info`` -> ``drac_vnc_password``. Nova uses this password for handshake. ``get_vnc_console`` method will provide it to Nova. End user will not see this password. * Changes will be proposed to nova-novncproxy: auth scheme ``rfb.VNC`` will be added. ``RFBAuthSchemeVNC`` class will be emplemented. Alternatives ------------ Accept this limitation and only offer a serial console. Use out-of-band KVM access provided by administrator without Ironic support. Data model impact ----------------- New field ``password`` will be added to the ``console_auth_tokens`` table REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- The VNC connection to the nodes are secured by a token generated while creating the console in Nova. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- New option ``vnc`` is added to auth_schemes list in ``vnc`` segment in ``nova.conf``. This allows nova-novncproxy to detect and load ``rfb.authvnc`` auth scheme. .. code-block:: ini [vnc] auth_schemes = none,vencrypt,vnc Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: kirillgermanov Other contributors: None Feature Liaison --------------- None Work Items ---------- * nova-novncproxy: implement rfb auth schemes authvnc.RFBAuthSchemeVNC according to rfb protocol. Some codes suporting this new auth scheme. * nova-compute-ironic: add new method ``get_vnc_console`` to Ironic virt driver * db: add new field to ConsoleAuthToken table: ``password``.

This commit adds a new parameter called MysqlGaleraSSLCipher to
easily override the default value 'AES128-SHA256' if required.

This is the last change of the series of changes to implements partial
support for overriding the ContainerImaePrepare parameter for
individual roles, so that users can use different set of images for
each role.

example:
parameter_defaults:
  ContainerImagePrepare:
    - push_destination: true
      set:
        name_prefix: openstack-
        name_suffix: ''
        namespace: quay.io/repository/tripleowallabycentos9

  ComputeEl8ContainerImagePrepare:
    - push_destination: true

        name_prefix: openstack-
        name_suffix: ''
        namespace: quay.io/repository/tripleowallabycentos8
        ...

This change makes the deployment command to generate the image
parameters in tht according to these layered definitions.

Libvirt needs to be able to plug ports into openvswitch bridges.
It does this using the ovs-vsctl command, which it searches for
in $PATH[1, 2]. This change will optionally install a wrapper
script that executes the ovs-vsctl commands in the context of the
openvswitchd container. This is useful when running libvirt on the
host whilst still running openvswitch in a container. The advantage
of this method over install the packages on the host is that it
ensures client compatability with the daemon. The default is set
to false as the wrapper could overwrite ovs-vsctl installed on the
host.

tox4 even when running specific env with -e option tries
to find python version for all envs defined in envlist[1]
when running with --skip-missing-interpreters=false and
fails if interpreter missing for any of the env.

With py38 in envlist it tries to find python3.8
which is not available in ubuntu-jammy by default
and fails, hence use generic version instead i.e py3
to handle it.

Once [1] is fixed we can update the list as per

So far, the Octavia `openstack loadbalancer status show <lb>` API did
not show non attached / non default pools and nested pool resources
(like pool members, healthmonitors, etc) in its output when created
with LB single-create-calls.

The pools were missing from the LoadBalancerStatusResponse class.

This patch adds the pools to its output.

(https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre) This was used by the BBC to create environmental dashboards: https://superuser.openstack.org/articles/environmental-reporting-dashboards-for-openstack-from-bbc-rd/ Problem description =================== Currently, this is not possible to get consumption per VM as scaphandre requires a directory on the compute node accessible into running VMs. This directory contains data required by the scaphandre instance (guest agent) running on the VM to correctly reports VM and VM associated processes consumption. Scaphandre proposed solution to get these data is to mount the directory using virtiofs in the VM. However, the user can not do that, as it requires a VM XML definition file to be modified, and this is managed can only be done by nova. Use Cases --------- - As a user, I want to know the consumption of my compute node and drill down to VM and VM processes individual consumption. - As an administrator, I want to allow this usage but make sure the user can mount only the configured required directory. down to VM and VM processes individual consumption. Proposed change =============== This change relies on https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/yoga/approved/libvirt-virtiofs-attach-manila-shares.html specification. Proposed solution requires to slightly modify the shares API and compute configuration: - Add an allow list maintained by administrator to define the scaphandre directory as a filesystem that is allowed to be mounted in the VM. - Change the shares rest API to allow user to pass the scaphandre directory location that needs to be mounted from the compute to the VM. - If a directory is passed, skip the mount / umount part from manilla in that case. Alternatives ------------ TBD REST API impact --------------- * ``POST /servers/{server_id}/shares`` Attach a share to an instance. Add a mutually exclusive ``export_location`` field to ``shareId`` that will allow for mounting that directory as a ""local"" share on the VM. Return Code(s): 202,400,401,403,404,409 .. note:: In that case shareId will be reported as local.

When iDRAC is still loading, some of the components is not available
for short period of time and returns HTTP 500 error with SYS518 error
code and message ""iDRAC is currently unable to display any information
because data sources are unavailable."". There is already retry on GET
errors with Server side error, but this can happen also for other
requests, for example, DELETE.
This patch adds retry for all SYS518 failures disregarding request
method. This helps to fix a known intermittent issue when deleting
set of volumes one after another and iDRAC is reloading after
deleting each volume.

If a HTTPS termination listener exists, set the tune.ssl.cachesize
setting to use about half of the available
memory (free + buffers + cached) on the amphora minus the memory needed
for network sockets based on the global max connections setting.
A larger SSL cache allows for more resumed SSL sessions and
therefore less computationally expensive SSL handshakes.

The new ""cpu-pinning"" element optimizes the amphora image for better
vertical scaling. When an amphora flavor with multiple vCPUs is
configured it will configure the kernel to isolate (isolcpus)
all vCPUs except the first one.
Furthermore, it uninstalls irqbalance and sets the IRQ affinity to the
first CPU. That way the other CPUs are free to be used by HAProxy
exclusively. A new customized TuneD profile applies some more tweaks
for improving network latency.

This spec proposes to use the os-extend_volume_completion volume action
that has been proposed for Cinder to provide feedback on success or
failure when handling volume-extended external server events.

A previous version of this spec proposed a new API in Nova, but is has
since been rewritten completely.
The old version can be found in Patchset 6 and earlier.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================== Add API for assisted volume extend ================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/assisted-volume-extend This blueprint proposes a new top-level API for extending attached volumes. This is necessary to allow Cinder to resize attached file-based volumes (such as the ones managed by the NFS driver), which has to be done by the QEMU process holding the lock on the file. Problem description =================== File-based volume drivers in Cinder use the ``qemu-img`` tool to extend volumes. However, when the volume is attached to a guest, QEMU will lock the file and ``qemu-img`` will be unable to resize it. In this case, only the QEMU process holding the lock can resize the volume, which can be triggered through the monitor. Libvirt supports this with the ``virsh blockresize`` command. The Nova API already has support for this mechanism through the ``volume-extended`` external server event. Unfortunately, this is not suitable for resizing attached volumes because the external server event API does not provide any feedback on whether an event was handled successfully. The instance action API does provide some feedback with ``extend_volume`` action entries, but does not provide any information on which volume a specific entry refers to. Also, the handler of the ``volume-extended`` event assumes that the size of the volume has already been updated in the database. If we rely on Nova to perform the actual resize, Cinder should not update the size (or commit the quota reservation) until it knows that the operation was successful. External server events, however, have only a single text field for arguments, which, in this case, is already used for the ID of the extended volume. So there is currently no clean way to communicate the new volume size to Nova, appart from updating it in the database. Extending attached volumes is currently disabled for the file-based NFS, NetApp ONTAP NFS, and Quobyte drivers. Previous discussion of the issue can be found in [1]_ and [2]_. Use Cases --------- As a user, I want to extend a NFS/NetApp ONTAP NFS/Quobyte volume while it is attached to an active instance. Proposed change =============== Introduce a new API microversion that adds the new ``POST /os-assisted-volume-extend`` API. The new API is intended to be used exclusively by Cinder when extending attached volumes, and it will require admin access to the Nova. Just like the ``volume-extended`` external server event, it will cause nova-compute to call the ``extend_volume`` method of the virt driver. Unlike the external server event, it will work synchronously, providing information on the success of the operation back to the caller, and the new volume size will be provided as an argument instead of being read from Cinder. Cinder will be updated to use the new API, if available. Alternatives ------------ One possible alternative would be to just ignore the lock and use a tool such as ``truncate`` to extend the volume file. This would allow Cinder to perform the resize, making any API changes unnecessary. Extending an in-use volume file should be safe as long as only the size is increased, however, it is hard to make any guarantees about this, and the QEMU documentation explicitely warns against externally modifying in-use disk image files [3]_. So the safer option is probably to have Nova perform the resize through Libvirt. In this case, Cinder needs to know whether the operation was successful or not. One option for this would be the introduction of a new callback in the Cinder API that could be used by the ``volume-extended`` handler to notify cinder of a success or failure to extend, somewhat similar to the ``os-migrate_volume_completion`` volume action in the Cinder API. However this would still be lacking a mechanism to communicate the new volume size to Nova, beyond changing it in Cinder's database, which we should avoid when the volume has not actually been extended yet. We might be able to abuse the volume metadata for this purpose, or even introduce a new field to the volume object. Both of these options have the problem of introducing additional state to the volume object, that we need to manage and clean up if anything goes wrong. A cleaner solution might be to extend the external server event API to take additional data per event, because this information is only required during the extend operation. We could also try to update the external event API to allow synchronous handling of events, so Cinder wouldn't need a separate callback. This would probably go beyond the scope of the external server event API, however, turning it into something like a second server action API. Modifying this API might also impact other services using it. Previous discussions of different alternatives can be found in [2]_ and the etherpad [4]_, which was created in the context of [1]_. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- Starting with the new microversion, there will be a ``POST /os-assisted-volume-extend`` API, that can be called with a body of the following form:: { ""volume-extend"": { ""server_id"": ""c90ba9ca-3026-46d9-a485-138538a6694f"", ""volume_id"": ""8ef7c423-e67e-454c-aaad-88da8b1a6b63"", ""new_size"": 10 } } with ``volume_id`` being the UUID of the attached volume, ``server_id`` being the UUID of the server it is attached to, and ``new_size`` being the target size of the extend operation. * If successful, it will return HTTP 200 OK. * If the server or the volume does not exist, or if the volume is not attached to the server, or if the new size is smaller than the old size, it will return HTTP 400 Bad Request. * A version of nova-compute that does not support this feature yet should result in HTTP 500 Internal Server Error Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- If nova-compute does not yet support the new API (like during a rolling upgrade), the call will fail with ``500 Internal Server Error``. Cinder will catch this and roll back the extend operation. This is unlikely to happen in practice though, because it only affects volumes for which attached resize was previously unsupported. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: kgube Feature Liaison --------------- Feature liaison: None yet Work Items ---------- * extend the ``ComputeManager.extend_volume`` method with an optional new_size parameter to be used instead of the volumes current size. * make the method individually callable through the rpcapi. * create the new ``/os-assisted-volume-extend`` API to call the method. * adapt and extend the unit tests for the ``volume-extended`` event for the new API. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= The implementation builds on existing code (``ComputeManager.extend_volume``), so any tests for this code should be extended appropriately. Apart from this, we should test a successful call, as well as all the conditions leading to HTTP 400 and the case of nova-compute not yet supporting the feature. Documentation Impact ==================== Updating the API reference should be sufficient. References ========== .. [1] https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1870367 ..

Before this patch, the metadata agent would provision network namespace
for all subnets under a network(datapath) as soon as the first
VM(vif port) was mounted on the chassis. This operation can take very
long time for networks with lots of subnets. See the linked bug for
more details.
This patch changes this mechanism to ""lazy load"" where metadata agent
provisions metadata namespace with only the subnets belonging to the
active ports on the chassis. This results in virtually constant
throughput not effected by the number of subnets.

Nova's usage of the privsep library is too broad. A single global permission
profile with all needed capabilities is defined for all functions that interact
with privsep to use. While this works, it is not the best usage of the library
as functions are getting a set of rights they do not need and thus should not

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Review usage of oslo-privsep library on Nova ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/privsep-usage-review Nova's usage of the privsep library is too broad. A single global permission profile with all needed capabilities is defined for all functions that interact with privsep to use. While this works, it is not the best usage of the library as functions are getting a set of rights they do not need and thus should not receive. This spec seeks to fix this situation by defining a more specialized usage of the library. Problem description =================== Nova compute services use the oslo-privsep library to obtain some root privileges on the host system with the intention of invoking commands on it. Thing is, current usage of the library by Nova does not follow good practices. A single permission profile is shared by all functions that make use of the library, and this one aggregates all capabilities required by the entirety of them. This means that because of a function that operates over files, another one that does nothing over them will get rights over the filesystem as their profile is shared. This may lead to unexpected behaviors on the system that can be avoided if just enough capabilities are used on each case. Use Cases --------- As a developer, I want to have a fined tuned method for acquiring root rights. As an admin, I want Nova to use root as little as possible. Proposed change =============== Considering that all functions that use the privsep library are found under ``nova.privsep``. First step is to study and map each with the capabilities they require. Next, a set of profiles can be defined for common use cases, such as network or system rights, and cover with them as much as possible. For the rest, a custom per case profile will need to be defined. If possible, profiles could be defined within each of the modules that use them, instead of in ``__init__.py`` like now, in order to reduce their scope. Alternatives ------------ None that I can think of. Please, provide any feedback on the scope of this spec and its approach. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- Requires the use of elevated privileges. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ Incorrect mapping of elevated capabilities may result on failing system commands. Other deployer impact --------------------- The change has immediate effect once merged. Developer impact ---------------- Developers will need to analyze which capabilities are required for any new functions under ``nova.privsep`` and apply the correct profile accordingly. Upgrade impact -------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: jsanemet Feature Liaison --------------- Feature liaison: sylvainb Work Items ---------- * Study functions that already use oslo-privsep to determine which capabilities each need. * Define profiles for functions that share a common context, i.e.: run a system command, modify network settings... * Define by-case profiles for functions that were not covered by the general ones. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Tempest tests could be defined targeting functionality that interacts with the host system, testing through that the functions affected by this spec.

Project and user names would be first fetched from cache, if not found,
they will be requested from keystone and then cached. Using cache will
significanlty reduce the number of calls made to keystone.

If ceilometer is configured with no caching backend, the results
will always be fetched by querying request to keystone.

A new config option, `tenant_name_discovery` is introduced
to operate this feature. This feature is optional and is disabled by default.

No attempts to identify names will be made if uuids are found to be `None`.

Because current TripleO no longer supports baremetal services and

The RsyslogExtraLoggingSource parameter, which was added by [1], has
had no effect because of the missing top-level service name under
the service_config_settings key.

Also the parameter is used by the rsyslog service so it's not really
required to use the service_config_settings, which is used to pass
puppet parameters to a different service.
