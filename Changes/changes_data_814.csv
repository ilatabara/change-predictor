Since Ice367b73303d74c529351d7bd4d9a4e9b1348e07 , the check has been
added when nova-volume(not cinder) was enabled. At the time, we didn't

However that skip might hide configration issues and we have removed

There is still the same skip code in Tempest, and this patch removes

This patch reverts the two commits listed below. There was a problem
with CephClusterFSID generation as it was created by the password
generation code in Mistral in Newton. However, this password generation
didn't work for upgrades as it didn't take into account upgrades and
passwords that were in use in an existing Heat stack.

This issue was resolved in I3ea6bbd0d9c5dd345b8a4a26a1788326e09d4209.
Now when a deployment plan is created, if there is an existing Heat
stack it takes the parameters from the Heat stack and uses those, rather
than regenerating. This change should also resolve the issue where the
CephClusterFSID was regenerated.

Revert ""Generate CephClusterFSID for new stacks""
This reverts commit 20167e850a6bcb1fbb1bfa8cb030000600c3dc27.

Revert ""Revert ""Add CephClusterFSID to generated passwords""""

(tripleo-quickstart-extras) consisting of the merged history of all
previously used roles.

Further changes to these roles are to be submitted to this
tripleo-quickstart-extras repo through review.openstack.org instead of

Several role name changes occured during this transition, which this
change also corrects in playbooks hosted within this repository.

It looks like mcollective is restarted two times duting boot
process. First, it simply restarted by nailgun-agent to change
node's ID. And then it gets restarted by fix-configs-on-startup
after it fixes mcollective's configuration file.

It turns out that such sequence of restarts may cause node's
provisioning problems when node's boot process is delayed. The
simpe workaround is to run fix-configs-on-startup by nailgun-agent
instead of simply restarting mcollective.

Implement upgrade testing for os_glance role.

This patch adds an upgrade testenv, which configures a previous version
of glance, and the test-vars from the stable/newton branch to be used by
the previous version of glance.

We don't run functional tests after the initial stable/newton deploy
because a working stable/newton branch is already tested, and it's
assumed it worked if the upgrade works too - which is more efficient.

This change enables the hacking extensions ability in trove. That
includes bumping the version of hacking that we use, and also adding
the enable-extensions like in the [flake8] section. I've enabled two
of the hacking extensions here.

There are some limitations to the hacking rules that I've enabled so
I'm also going to enter two bugs that others can fix (if they so
desire).

When multiple resources in a stack have identical definitions, there is no
purpose in re-running validation on every single one. This is a common
occurrence in, for example, autoscaling groups.

By eliminating the need to validate every identical resource, this patch
should help prevent timeouts on create/update with large autoscaling groups
of the kind created by e.g. Magnum.

Add -S option to support subgraph execution. This would allow a user
to pick which tasks to stop on.

Example:

fuel2 graph execute -S keystone-db:openstack-controller/1

will start with all keystone-db tasks and end at openstack-controller at
node-1

The live one and a half day class is focusing on hands-on practice like the students can use a prepared development environment to learn how to test, prepare and upload new code snippets or documentation for review. The attendees are also given the opportunity to join a mentoring program to get further help and guidance on their journey to become an active and successful member of the OpenStack community.","We've designed a training program to help professional developers negotiate this hurdle. It shows them how to ensure their bug fix or feature is accepted in the OpenStack project in a minimum amount of time.

It also translates Neutron data structures into\n'os-vif' VIF objects which are then stored in Kubernetes pod\nannotations for use by Kuryr-Kubernetes CNI driver.\n\nFuture patches will extend VIFHandler to use various modular plugins\nto perform OpenStack-related operations (e.g. PortOperationsPlugin for\nport operations, NetworkOperationsPlugin for network & subnet\noperations, SecurityGroupOperationsPlugin for handling security groups\nand ProjectOperationsPlugin to support multiple OpenStack\nprojects/tenants) to allow flexible configurations without duplicating\nthe event-handling functionality provided by VIFHandler.\n\nNote that some of the VIFHandler methods are not covered by unit\ntests. That is because those methods are intended to use the plugins\ninstead. Once the plugin framework and the corresponding plugins are\nintroduced the unit tests will be updated accordingly.\n\nNote that this patch also introduces Neutron<->os-vif translation in\nform of the 'kuryr_kubernetes.os_vif_util' module.

All it does is install the python-heat-agent package and enable the

The intention is for this element to be merged unused, then a change

expected.

This is part of the effort to deprecate the entire

In the patch I9abc0878612b97795c68c8d773e7a29e891d1a6f, I introduced
the configuration of CNI settings. However, that was not supported on
1.3.x, so a bump was necessary. This highlights the need for devstack
fullstack tests.

This commit switching tasks resolution approach to the tags based one.
Tag - minimal unit what's necessary only for task resolution and can be
mapped to the node through the role interface only. Each role provides set
of tags in its 'tags' field and may be modified via role API. Tag may be
created separately via tag API, but, this tag can not be used unless it's
stuck to the role.

This change also removes most of the logic from ironic's
RequestContext to reuse the oslo_context as much as possible.
Usage of domain_id and domain_name in policy files is deprecated
and their support will be removed in the Pike release. domain_id
field was removed from the context class completely, domain_name
value now mathces the oslo_context expectations.

ContextHook is changed too so as not to duplicate from_environ
functional from oslo_context.

to_dict method left as is, so that we don't break an older service
receiving the context over RPC. It will be changed in Pike release
to reuse the base oslo_context class' to_dict.

Panicking and returning non-success on stop often leads to resource
becoming unmanaged on that node.

Before we called get_status to verify that RabbitMQ is dead. But
sometimes it returns error even though RabbitMQ is not running. There
is no reason to call it - we will just verify that there is no beam

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =========================== Composable Service Upgrades =========================== TODO: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tripleo In the Newton release tripleo delivered composable service deployments (IS there a spec? Can't find one at newton_specs_ ) which means that deployers can now specify a roles_data.yaml_ that determines which services are deployed on a given (now arbitrarily named) node. That is, there can no longer be any assumptions made about the node 'type' in reference to an expected or known list of services previously deployed on that given node or others of the same type. The current upgrades workflow_ is organised around the node *type* determining the order in which that given node and services provided therein are upgraded. The workflow dictates ""swifts"", before ""controllers"", before ""cinders"", before ""computes"", before ""cephs"". The reasons for this ordering are beyond the scope here and ultimately inconsequential since the important point to note is that for Newton to Ocata, we can no longer drive a node-type based workflow for upgrades. Consensus after the initial discussion during the Ocata design summit session_ was that: * Re-engineering the upgrades workflow for Newton to Ocata is necessary because 'composable roles' * We should start by moving the upgrades logic into the composable service manifests in the tripleo-heat-templates (i.e. into each service) * There is still a need for an over-arching workflow - albeit service rather than node oriented. * It is TBD what will drive that workflow. We will use whatever will be 'easier' for a first iteration, especially given the Ocata development time contraints. Problem Description =================== As explained in the introduction above, the current upgrades workflow_ can no longer work for composable service deployments. Right now the upgrade scripts are organised around and indeed targetted at specific nodes: the upgrade script for swifts_ is different to that for computes_ or for controllers (split across a number_ of_ steps_) cinders_ or cephs_. These scripts are invoked as part of a worfklow where each step is either a heat stack update or invocation of the upgrade-non-controller.sh_ script to execute the node specific upgrade script (delivered as one of the earlier steps in the workflow) on non controllers. One way to handle this problem is to decompose the upgrades logic from those monolithic per-node upgrade scripts into per-service upgrades logic. This should live in the tripleo-heat-templates puppet services_ manifests for each service. For the upgrade of a give service we need to express: * any pre-upgrade requirements (run a migration, stop a service, pin RPC) * any post upgrade (migrations, service starts/reload config) * any dependencies on other services (upgrade foo only after bar) If we organise the upgrade logic in this manner the idea is to gain the flexibility to combine this dynamically into the new upgrades workflow. Besides the per-service upgrades logic the worklow will also need to handle and provide for any deployment wide upgrades related operations such as unpin of the RPC version once all services are successfully running Ocata, or upgrading of services that aren't directly managed or configured by the tripleo deployment (like openvswitch as just one example), or even the delivery of a new kernel which will require a reboot on the given service node after all services have been upgraded. Proposed Change =============== The first step is to work out where to add upgrades related configuration to each service in the tripleo-heat-templates services_ manifests. The exact format will depend on what we end up using to drive the workflow. We could include them in the *outputs* as 'upgrade_config', like:: outputs: role_data: description: Role data for the Nova Compute service. value: service_name: nova_compute ... pre_upgrade_config: list_join: - '' - - ""#!/bin/bash\n\n"" - ""crudini --set /etc/nova/nova.conf upgrade_levels compute $upgrade_level_nova_compute"" - ""nova-manage db sync"" - ""yum install python-zaqarclient"" post_upgrade_config: ... We would then need to combine the upgrades config from each service making sure we can enforce service ordering where this is needed (keystone before nova, for example). The details of the workflow itself, and in particular whether this will be driven by a mistral worfklow for example are still TBD. Hopefully this spec is a first step at facilitating that discussion. One other point of note that was brought up in the Ocata design summit session_ and which should factor into the design here is that operators may wish to run the upgrade in stages rather than all at once. It could still be the case that the new workflow can differentiate between 'controlplane' vs 'non-controlplane' services. The operator could then upgrade controlplance services as one stand-alone upgrade step and then later start to roll out the upgrade of non-controlplane services. Even then the operator may wish to only upgrade some number of nodes running non-controlplane service. For example upgrade 10 nova-compute nodes at a time. Alternatives ------------ One alternative is to have a stand-alone upgrades workflow driven by ansible. Some early work and prototyping was done as well as a (linked from the Ocata design summit session_). Ultimately there was resistance to adopting another external tool for the workflow.

For Kolla old-timers, many know that Kolla in its present form may not have existed without this general consensus of ideas set by ansible-multi. All specifications in this repository are subject to abandonment in the future if the development team finds it necessary to change course.

This shouldn't be happening in a transaction. It creates
port resources in ML2 that need to have correct commit

This refactors it to leverage the callback framework and
unifies the codepath for creating these DVR ports after
a router creation and after a router update with a migration.

Currently ipaddress is being set from nova instance port and thus
making vm ip and container ip same. Fix this by using container port
dict for getting container IP.

Another change is renaming 'nested_port', which is actually Nova
instance port, to 'vm_port', for the sake of avoiding ambiguity.

Changes:

- remove report from task engine;
- remove old logic for hangs and 'idling' statuses;
- increase code redability;
- add code docs;
- support retries in case of MClient errors for status
  and run actions;
- replace timeout raise on usual code;
- descrease waiting time for puppet run (from 120 to 10) and
  time between try (from 30 to 2);
- mcollective retry descrease from 5 to 1. Now it will use
  puppet retries if failed during network/mcollective problem

This commit changes override_resources type allowing to
- specify any puppet resource
- pass any number of resources

It also introduces the logic to decide whether override_resources
should create a new resource, if it hasn't been found in the catalog.

The resource overrides as well as additional settings are taken from
Hiera.

This logic essentially allows to create any Puppet resource via
passing the right hash to the Hiera. It replaces/extends the old
'Advanced configuration' feature.

In a future patch we should also remove the enable_loadbalancer boolean

This moves the floating IP port creation outside of the transaction
that creates the floating IP record. This eliminates the use of one
of the GUARD_TRANSACTION flags to prepare us for the enginefacade
switch and correct event notification semantics for push
notifications.

Note that this introduces a small window where the server can die
mid-process and leave an orphaned port without a floating IP. This
is similar to what can happen for router gateway ports. The intention
is to address these in a follow-up patch with a periodic garbage
collection task that will look for floating IP ports with a device
ID of 'PENDING' since the tenant cannot delete them on their own.

When downstream want to use local translations, all they want to do is
update their .po files with their added strings and then add in their
matching translations. Because this is handled in zanata, there is no
straightforward way of doing this within Horizon currently, without
having some in depth knowledge of babel (or even knowing that we use
babel, which isnt standard in django). Previously this would have been
handled by manage.py makemessages, so this patch just adds some tox envs
for convenience.

A normal workflow for these envs would be:
1. Add new strings to horizon or some other downstream customisation
2. Use tox -e extractmessages to create the .pot file
3. Use tox -e update_catalog -- <locale> to update the .po files for
your chosen locale.

This patch introduces identity service. It is first step of unifying usage of
identity service and it bases on keystone wrapper.

Changes:
 - New service Identity is added with two version implementation(
   KeystoneServiceV2 and KeystoneServiceV3)
 - KeystoneWrapper is deprecated. It's impelemention is replaced by
   identity service
 - To reduce number of imports of eystoneclient around rally code,
   `_get_domain_id` method of KeystoneServiceV3 raises rally specific
   exception for 404 instead of keystone native exception
 - To avoid code duplication, `create_user` implementation of
   KeystoneServiceV3 starts using `list_roles` and `add_role` of Identity
   service instead of direct calls to keystoneclient.
 - Port several keystone scenarios related to roles to use IdentityService

TODO for further patches:
- move code from rally.plugins.openstack.scenarios.keystone.utils to Identity
  service
- add more support for Keystone V3

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================== Composable HA architecture ========================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tripleo/+spec/composable-ha Since Newton, we have the following services managed by pacemaker: * Cloned and master/slave resources: galera, redis, haproxy, rabbitmq * Active/Passive resources: VIPs, cinder-volume, cinder-backup, manila-share It is currently not possible to compose the above service in the same way like we do today via composable roles for the non-pacemaker services This spec aims to address this limitation and let the operator be more flexible in the composition of the control plane. Problem Description =================== Currently tripleo has implemented no logic whatsoever to assign specific pacemaker managed services to roles/nodes. * Since we do not have a lot in terms of hard performance data, we typically recommend three controller nodes. This is perceived as a scalability limiting factor and there is a general desire to be able to assign specific nodes to specific pacemaker-managed services (e.g. three nodes only for galera, five nodes only for rabbitmq) * Right now if the operator deploys on N controllers he will get N cloned instances of the non-A/P pacemaker services on the same N nodes. We want to be able to be much more flexible. E.g. deploy galera on the first 3 nodes, rabbitmq on the remaining 5 nodes, etc. * It is also desirable for the operator to be able to choose on which nodes the A/P resources will run. * We also currently have a scalability limit of 16 nodes for the pacemaker cluster. Proposed Change =============== Overview -------- The proposal here is to keep the existing cluster in its current form, but to extend it in two ways: 1) Allow the operator to include a specific service in a custom node and have pacemaker run that resource only on that node. E.g. the operator can define the following custom nodes: - Node A pacemaker galera - Node B pacemaker rabbitmq - Node C pacemaker VIPs, cinder-volume, cinder-backup, manila-share, redis, haproxy With the above definition the operator can instantiate any number of A, B or C nodes and scale up to a total of 16 nodes. Pacemaker will place the resources only on the appropriate nodes. 2) Allow the operator to extend the cluster beyond 16 nodes via pacemaker remote. For example an operator could define the following: - Node A pacemaker galera rabbitmq - Node B pacemaker-remote redis - Node C pacemaker-remote VIPs, cinder-volume, cinder-backup, manila-share, redis, haproxy This second scenario would allow an operator to extend beyond the 16 nodes limit. The only difference to scenario 1) is the fact that the quorum of the cluster is obtained only by the nodes from Node A. The way this would work is that the placement on nodes would be controllerd by location rules that would work based on node properties matching. Alternatives ------------ A bunch of alternative designs was discussed and evaluated: A) A cluster per service: One possible architecture would be to create a separate pacemaker cluster for each HA service. This has been ruled out mainly for the following reasons: - It cannot be done outside of containers - It would create a lot of network traffic - It would increase the management/monitoring of the pacemaker resources and clusters exponentially - Each service would still be limited to 16 nodes - A new container fencing agent would have to be written B) A single cluster where only the clone-max property is set for the non A/P services This would be still a single cluster, but unlike today where the cloned and master/slave resources run on every controller we would introduce variables to control the maximum number of nodes a resource could run on. E.g. GaleraResourceCount would set clone-max to a value different than the number of controllers. Example: 10 controllers, galera has clone-max set to 3, rabbit to 5 and redis to 3. While this would be rather simple to implement and would change very little in the current semantics, this design was ruled out: - We'd still have the 16 nodes limit - It would not provide fine grained control over which services live on which nodes Security Impact --------------- No changes regarding security aspects compared to the existing status quo. Other End User Impact --------------------- No particular impact except added flexibility in placing pacemaker-managed resources. Performance Impact ------------------ The performance impact here is that with the added scalability it will be possible for an operator to dedicate specific nodes for certain pacemaker-managed services. There are no changes in terms of code, only a more flexible and scalable way to deploy services on the control plane. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- This proposal aims to use the same method that the custom roles introduced in Newton use to tailor the services running on a node. With the very same method it will be possible to do that for the HA services managed by pacemaker today. Developer Impact ---------------- No impact Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: michele Other contributors: cmsj Work Items ---------- We need to work on the following: 1) Add location rule constraints support in puppet 2) Make puppet-tripleo set node properties on the nodes where a service is included and create corresponding location rules 3) Add a puppet-tripleo pacemaker-remote profile Dependencies ============ No additional dependencies are required. Testing ======= We will need to test the flexible placement of the pacemaker-managed services within the CI. This can be done within today's CI limitations (i.e. in the three controller HA job we can make sure that the placement is customized and working) Documentation Impact ==================== No impact References ========== Mostly internal discussions within the HA team at Red Hat ",,195,0

Improve asynchronous push mode of HeatStack:
- Use spawn_after instead of spawn_after_local. Otherwise the data is never
   pushed if the initiated thread were to exit
- Cancel background thread instead of killing it. Cancel cancels the thread
   only if it hasn't started yet instead of killing it somewhere in the middle.
- Add post-execution cleanup to guarantee that async data push happens
   before the execution session end
- Make Instance destruction use async push to speed up the destruction
   in case when there are many servers and to test the HeatStack async mode

Cinder tests were deleting all the Heat stacks in their teardown.
This caused strange deployments errors when the tests were executed
cocurrently because stacks from other tests were deleted and partially
recreated in concurrent deployments which caused different consistency
errors.

that leads to 'Internal Server Error 500' while trying
to get/update/delete non-existing roles. This patch adds
check role procedure and returns 404 not found responce
instead Internal Server Error.

Adds in the implementation of objects.ResourceClass.create() with checks
that the custom resource class being added doesn't overlap with any
standard (or previously-added custom) resource classes. The
implementation uses a hard-coded number 10000 to mark the start of
custom resource class integer identifiers to make it easy to
differentiate custom resource classes. Note that we do NOT increment the
object version here because nothing as-yet calls the ResourceClass
object.

Also note that this patch adds a required ""CUSTOM_"" namespace prefix to
all custom resource classes. Followup patches will also place this
constraint into the JSONSchema for POST /resource_classes. The CUSTOM_
namespace is required in order to ensure that custom resource class
names never conflict with future standard resource class additions.

Currenlty passing the parameter --floating-ip-enabled while

By default cluster is created with floating ip enabled, so user
should have a way to disable it.
This patch renames the parameter --floating-ip-enabled to
--floating-ip-disabled.
User can now pass --floating-ip-disabled while creating cluster
template to disable floating ip.

This patch removes deprecated methods from Neutron DHCP provider:

 * create_cleaning_ports
 * delete_cleaning_ports

Also drop related methods from deploy_utils in ironic.drivers.modules

 * prepare_cleaning_ports
 * tear_down_cleaning_ports

If you have your own custom ironic DHCP provider that implements
cleaning methods, you may need to update your code to use the
add_cleaning_network() and remove_cleaning_network() network interface
methods.

They were deprecated in I0c26582b6b6e9d32650ff3e2b9a3269c3c2d5454

During spawn, the Hyper-V driver should wait for the Neutron
VIF plug events before starting the instance, in order to ensure
that the VIFs are already bound and the guest will be able to
send DHCP requests.

The configuration option ""vif_plugging_timeout"" will determine
the maximum amount of time to wait for the Neutron events.

Setting the configuration option ""vif_plugging_is_fatal"" to True
will cause an exception to be raised during spawn, if the Hyper-V
driver did not receive needed Neutron port bound events.

for fresh Ubuntu Xenial

Since Ubuntu 15.04 the file 'pxelinux.0' is provided by different
package ('pxelinux') which is not being installed by DevStack.
Extra problem is that this package does not exsit for earlier Ubuntu
versions at all.

More over, while in Trusty 'syslinux' package depends on
'syslinux-common', it only recommends it in Xenial, but we need it
installed as it provides *.c32 modules required for syslinux.

This patch adds 'syslinux-common' and 'pxelinux' to required deb packages
list when distro is 'xenial' or 'jessie' (as this packaging change has
its origin in Debian) by using the distro pinning in the package lists
as supported by DevStack.

We extend the resource-providers series to modify the
scheduler to filter compute nodes by calling the placement API
instead of retrieving all compute nodes in the deployment and
filtering on the Python side.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================================ Resource Providers - Scheduler Filters in DB ============================================ https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/resource-providers-scheduler-db-filters This blueprint extends the `resource-providers` series of blueprints by having the scheduler make use of the `inventories` and `allocations` table to pre-filter compute nodes from evaluation during `select_destinations()`. Problem description =================== Currently, on each call to the scheduler's `select_destinations()` RPC method, the scheduler retrieves a list of `ComputeNode` objects, one object for *every* compute node in the entire deployment. The scheduler constructs a set of `nova.scheduler.host_manager.HostState` objects, one for each compute node. Once the host state objects are constructed, the scheduler loops through them, passing the host state object to the collection of `nova.scheduler.filters.Filter` objects that are enabled for the deployment. Many of these scheduler filters do nothing more than calculate the amount of a particular resource that a compute node has available to it and return `False` if the amount requested is greater than the available amount of that type of resource. Having to return all compute node records in the entire deployment is extremely wasteful and this inefficiency gets worse the larger the deployment is. The filter loop is essentially implementing a `SQL` `WHERE` clause, but in Python instead of a more efficient database query. Use Cases ---------- None. Proposed change =============== We propose to winnow the set of compute nodes the scheduler evaluates by only returning the compute node resource providers that meet requested resource constraints. This will dramatically reduce the amount of compute node records that need to be pulled from the database on every call to `select_destinations()`. Alternatives ------------ We could create an entirely new scheduler driver instead of modifying the `FilterScheduler`. I'm not really in favor of this approach because it introduces more complexity to the system than simply replacing *some* of the Python filters with `WHERE` expressions on the `SELECT` against the `compute_nodes` table. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ I built a benchmarking harness_ that demonstrates that the more compute nodes in the deployment, the greater the gains are from doing filtering on the database side versus doing the filtering on the Python side and returning a record for each compute node in the system. .. _harness: http://github.com/jaypipes/placement-bench Other deployer impact --------------------- For deployers who disable the resource/inventory scheduler filters (RAMFilter, DiskFilter, CoreFilter), this change would be non-backwards-compatible. Personally, I don't think this use case or deployment scenario is worth even catering to. A scheduler that doesn't make any decisions based on inventory is no scheduler IMHO. Developer impact ---------------- Nova developers will need to learn how to translate Python filters against resource amounts to their corresponding SQL equivalents. I already have the example code for this in both SQL and SQLAlchemy constructs in the benchmarking harness to this should hopefully be a pretty minimal learning curve. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: dstepanenko jaypipes Other contributors: cdent Work Items ---------- * Add a new `nova.objects.ComputeNodeList.get_all_matching_request_spec()` method that accepts a `nova.objects.RequestSpec` object and appends WHERE conditions on the SQL returned by `nova.db.sqlalchemy.api.compute_node_get_all()` * Separate patches for winnowing by RAM, vCPU, and local disk, with each patch successively adding WHERE conditions on the DB side and removing the scheduler filter that does the same work on the Python side * Leave NUMA and PCI device filters on the Python side of the scheduler for now until the `pci-generate-stats` blueprint is completed. We can have separate blueprints for handling NUMA and PCI resources via filters on the DB side Dependencies ============ The following blueprints are dependencies for this work: * `resource-classes` * `resource-providers` * `compute-node-inventory-newton` * `resource-providers-allocations` Testing ======= Existing functional tests should adequately validate that swapping out DB-side filtering for Python-side filtering of RAM, vCPU and local disk produces no different scheduling results from `select_destinations()` calls. Documentation Impact ==================== Developer reference material is needed that explains the evolution towards DB-side filtering. References ========== None.

Documents the syntax and meaning of container ACLs. Account ACLs
were already pretty well documented. However the account
ACL text was moved as part of this change.

TempAuth and keystoneauth have diffent ACLs. However, I decided
to describe both in one section/table because there are many
""examples"" of ACLs in other documents, and it's better that
someone coming here from those sources become aware that the
specific ACL might not apply to them. In addition, the
referrer and .rlistings is common to both.

Some changes were also made to the api-ref document. The doc
and api-ref documents are published as seperate documents, so
the cross references from the api-ref section will not work
until this patch merges and the documents are rebuilt.

TempAuth supports two types of ACL: - Per container based on the container's ``X-Container-Read`` and ``X-Container-Write`` ACLs. Container ACLs use the ""V1"" ACL syntax, which looks like this:: mary, bob, .r:example.com, .r:-hacker.site, .rlistings For more information see :ref:`container_acls`. - Per account ACLs based on the accounts ``X-Account-Access-Control`` metadata.

In this environment, Keystone is responsible for creating and validating tokens. The :ref:`keystoneauth` middleware is responsible for implementing the auth system within Swift as described here.

Swift will cache the token up to the expirationThe included TempAuth also has the concept of admin and non-admin usersNon-admin users can only perform operations per container based on the container's X-Container-Read and X-Container-Write ACLs. Container ACLs use the ""V1"" ACL syntax, which looks like this: ``name1, name2, .r:referrer1.com, .r:-bad.referrer1.com, .rlistings`` For more information on ACLs, see :mod:`swift.common.middleware.acl`. Additionally, if the auth system sets the request environ's swift_owner key to True, the proxy will return additional header information in some requests, such as the X-Container-Sync-Key for a container GET or HEAD. In addition to container ACLs, TempAuth allows account-level ACLs. Any auth system may use the special header ``X-Account-Access-Control`` to specify account-level ACLs in a format specific to that auth system. (Following the TempAuth format is strongly recommended.) These headers are visible and settable only by account owners (those for whom ``swift_owner`` is true). Behavior of account ACLs is auth-system-dependent. In the case of TempAuth, if an authenticated user has membership in a group which is listed in the ACL, then the user is allowed the access level of that ACL. Account ACLs use the ""V2"" ACL syntax, which is a JSON dictionary with keys named ""admin"", ""read-write"", and ""read-only"". (Note the case sensitivity.) An example value for the ``X-Account-Access-Control`` header looks like this: ``{""admin"":[""a"",""b""],""read-only"":[""c""]}`` Keys may be absent (as shown). The recommended way to generate ACL strings is as follows:: from swift.common.middleware.acl import format_acl acl_data = { 'admin': ['alice'], 'read-write': ['bob', 'carol'] } acl_string = format_acl(version=2, acl_dict=acl_data) Using the :func:`format_acl` method will ensure that JSON is encoded as ASCII (using e.g. '\u1234' for Unicode). While it's permissible to manually send ``curl`` commands containing ``X-Account-Access-Control`` headers, you should exercise caution when doing so, due to the potential for human error. Within the JSON dictionary stored in ``X-Account-Access-Control``, the keys have the following meanings: ============ ============================================================== Access Level Description ============ ============================================================== read-only These identities can read *everything* (except privileged headers) in the account. Specifically, a user with read-only account access can get a list of containers in the account, list the contents of any container, retrieve any object, and see the (non-privileged) headers of the account, any container, or any object. read-write These identities can read or write (or create) any container. A user with read-write account access can create new containers, set any unprivileged container headers, overwrite objects, delete containers, etc. A read-write user can NOT set account headers (or perform any PUT/POST/DELETE requests on the account). admin These identities have ""swift_owner"" privileges. A user with admin account access can do anything the account owner can, including setting account headers and any privileged headers -- and thus granting read-only, read-write, or admin access to other users. ============ ============================================================== For more details, see :mod:`swift.common.middleware.tempauth`. For details on the ACL format, see :mod:`swift.common.middleware.acl`.Swift is able to authenticate against OpenStack Keystone_ via the :ref:`keystoneauth` middleware.The Keystone project and the Swauth project are examples of additional auth services.

Graduation Process ================== By default, major new functionality that is proposed to be in-tree will start off in `experimental` status. Typically it would take at minimum of one cycle to transition from `experimental` to `stable`, although in special cases this might happened within a cycle.

A user itself must be owned by a specific domain, and hence all user names are **not** globally unique, but only unique to their domain. Groups ^^^^^^ ``Groups`` are a container representing a collection of users. A group itself must be owned by a specific domain, and hence all group names are **not** globally unique, but only unique to their domain.The Resource service provides data about `projects` and `domains`. Projects (Tenants) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ``Projects`` (known as Tenants in v2.0) represent the base unit of ``ownership`` in OpenStack, in that all resources in OpenStack should be owned by a specific project. A project itself must be owned by a specific domain, and hence all project names are **not** globally unique, but unique to their domain. If the domain for a project is not specified, then it is added to the default domain. Domains ^^^^^^^ ``Domains`` are a high-level container for projects, users and groups. Each is owned by exactly one domain. Each domain defines a namespace where an API-visible name attribute exists. keystone provides a default domain, aptly named 'Default'. In the Identity v3 API, the uniqueness of attributes is as follows: - Domain Name. Globally unique across all domains. - Role Name. Globally unique across all domains. - User Name. Unique within the owning domain. - Project Name. Unique within the owning domain. - Group Name. Unique within the owning domain. Due to their container architecture, domains may be used as a way to delegate management of OpenStack resources. A user in a domain may still access resources in another domain, if an appropriate assignment is granted.The Assignment service provides data about `roles` and `role assignments`. Roles ^^^^^ ``Roles`` dictate the level of authorization the end user can obtain. Roles can be granted at either the domain or project level. Role can be assigned to the individual user or at the group level. Role names are globally unique. Role Assignments ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ A 3-tuple that has a ``Role``, a ``Resource`` and an ``Identity``.======================== pipeline = healthcheck cors sizelimit http_proxy_to_wsgi osprofiler url_normalize request_id admin_token_auth build_auth_context token_auth json_body ec2_extension_v3 s3_extension service_v3 ============================================================================ Approach to Authentication? =========================== Two pieces of information are required to authenticate with keystone, a bit of ``Resource`` information and a bit of ``Identity``. Take the following call POST data for instance: .. code-block:: javascript { ""auth"": { ""identity"": { ""methods"": [ ""password"" ], ""password"": { ""user"": { ""id"": ""0ca8f6"", ""password"": ""secretsecret"" } } }, ""scope"": { ""project"": { ""id"": ""263fd9"" } } } } The user (ID of 0ca8f6) is attempting to retrieve a token that is scoped to project (ID of 263fd9). To perform the same call with names instead of IDs, we now need to supply information about the domain. This is because usernames are only unique within a given domain, but user IDs are supposed to be unique across the deployment. Thus, the auth request looks like the following: .. code-block:: javascript { ""auth"": { ""identity"": { ""methods"": [ ""password"" ], ""password"": { ""user"": { ""domain"": { ""name"": ""acme"" } ""name"": ""userA"", ""password"": ""secretsecret"" } } }, ""scope"": { ""project"": { ""domain"": { ""id"": ""1789d1"" }, ""name"": ""project-x"" } } } } For both the user and the project portion, we must supply either a domain ID or a domain name, in order to properly determine the correct user and project. Alternatively, if we wanted to represent this as environment variables for a command line, it would be: .. code-block:: bash $ export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID=1789d1 $ export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=acme $ export OS_USERNAME=userA $ export OS_PASSWORD=secretsecret $ export OS_PROJECT_NAME=project-x Note that the project the user it attempting to access must be in the same domain as the user. What is Scope? -------------- Scope is an overloaded term. In reference to authenticating, as seen above, scope refers to the portion of the POST data that dictates what ``Resource`` (project or domain) the user wants to access. In reference to tokens, scope refers to the effectiveness of a token, i.e.: a `project-scoped` token is only useful on the project it was initially granted for. A `domain-scoped` token may be used to perform domain-related function. In reference to users, groups, and projects, scope often refers to the domain that the entity is owned by. i.e.: a user in domain X is scoped to domain X.","------------ The Services ------------The Identity service provides auth credential validation and data about users and groups.The Resource service provides data about projects and domains. Like the Identity service, this data may either be managed directly by the service or be pulled from a custom authoritative backend service.The Assignment service provides data about roles and role assignments to the entities managed by the Identity and Resource services. Again, like these two services, this data may either be managed directly by the Assignment service or be pulled from a custom authoritative backend service. ------------------------------------------------ pipeline = sizelimit url_normalize build_auth_context token_auth admin_token_auth json_body ec2_extension_v3 s3_extension service_v3--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",177,211

Create the glance-fs Pacemaker resource on one node (pacemaker master)
instead of all nodes, and set verify_on_create to True.

* It will avoid a race condition if Puppet is applied on 2 nodes on the
  same time, so the filesystem is attempted to be created once.
* Verify with psc that the resource has been correctly created.

It should also be used by maintainers as a reference for proper driver behavior. This document will describe the driver interface and prescribe the expected behavior of any driver implemented to this interface. **Note well:** The API described in this document is internal to the oslo.messaging library and therefore **private**. Under no circumstances should this API be referenced by code external to the olso.messaging library. ================ Driver Interface ================ The driver interface is defined by a set of abstract base classes. The developer creates a driver by defining concrete classes from these bases. The derived classes embody the logic that is specific for the messaging back-end that is to be supported. These base classes are defined in the *base.py* file in the *_drivers* subdirectory. =============== IncomingMessage =============== .. autoclass:: IncomingMessage :members: ================== RpcIncomingMessage ================== .. autoclass:: RpcIncomingMessage :members: ======== Listener ======== .. autoclass:: Listener :members: ================= PollStyleListener ================= .. autoclass:: PollStyleListener :members: ========== BaseDriver ========== .. autoclass:: BaseDriver :members: ,,446,60

See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License. ========================================== Configuring Services to work with Keystone ========================================== .. toctree:: :maxdepth: 1 Once Keystone is installed and running (see :doc:`configuration`), services need to be configured to work with it. To do this, we primarily install and configure middleware for the OpenStack service to handle authentication tasks or otherwise interact with Keystone. In general: * Clients making calls to the service will pass in an authentication token. * The Keystone middleware will look for and validate that token, taking the appropriate action. * It will also retrieve additional information from the token such as user name, user id, project name, project id, roles, etc... The middleware will pass those data down to the service as headers. More details on the architecture of that setup is described in the `authentication middleware documentation`_. Setting up credentials with ``keystone-manage bootstrap`` ========================================================= Setting up projects, users, and roles ------------------------------------- The ``keystone-manage bootstrap`` command will create a user, project and role, and will assign the newly created role to the newly created user on the newly created project. By default, the names of these new resources will be called ``admin``. The defaults may be overridden by calling ``--bootstrap-username``, ``--bootstrap-project-name`` and ``--bootstrap-role-name``. Each of these have an environment variable equivalent: ``OS_BOOTSTRAP_USERNAME``, ``OS_BOOTSTRAP_PROJECT_NAME`` and ``OS_BOOTSTRAP_ROLE_NAME``. A user password must also be supplied. This can be passed in as either ``--bootstrap-password``, or set as an environment variable using ``OS_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD``. Optionally, if specified by ``--bootstrap-public-url``, ``--bootstrap-admin-url`` and/or ``--bootstrap-internal-url`` or the equivalent environment variables, the command will create an identity service with the specified endpoint information. You may also configure the ``--bootstrap-region-id`` and ``--bootstrap-service-name`` for the endpoints to your deployment's requirements. .. NOTE:: It is strongly encouraged to configure the identity service and its endpoints while bootstrapping keystone. Minimally, keystone can be bootstrapped with: .. code-block:: bash $ keystone-manage bootstrap --bootstrap-password s3cr3t Verbosely, keystone can be bootstrapped with: .. code-block:: bash $ keystone-manage bootstrap \ --bootstrap-password s3cr3t \ --bootstrap-username admin \ --bootstrap-project-name admin \ --bootstrap-role-name admin \ --bootstrap-service-name keystone \ --bootstrap-region-id RegionOne \ --bootstrap-admin-url http://localhost:35357 \ --bootstrap-public-url http://localhost:5000 \ --bootstrap-internal-url http://localhost:5000 This will create an ``admin`` user with the ``admin`` role on the ``admin`` project. The user will have the password specified in the command. Note that both the user and the project will be created in the ``default`` domain. By not creating an endpoint in the catalog users will need to provide endpoint overrides to perform additional identity operations. By creating an ``admin`` user and an identity endpoint deployers may authenticate to keystone and perform identity operations like creating additional services and endpoints using that ``admin`` user. This will preclude the need to ever use or configure the ``admin_token`` (described below). To test a proper configuration, a user can use OpenStackClient CLI: .. code-block:: bash $ openstack project list --os-username admin --os-project-name admin \ --os-user-domain-id default --os-project-domain-id default \ --os-identity-api-version 3 --os-auth-url http://localhost:5000 \ --os-password s3cr3t Setting up credentials with Admin Token ======================================= Admin Token ----------- For a default installation of Keystone, before you can use the REST API, you need to define an authorization token. This is configured in ``keystone.conf`` file under the section ``[DEFAULT]``. In the sample file provided with the Keystone project, the line defining this token is:: [DEFAULT] admin_token = ADMIN A ""shared secret"" that can be used to bootstrap Keystone. This token does not represent a user, and carries no explicit authorization. To disable in production (highly recommended), remove AdminTokenAuthMiddleware from your paste application pipelines (for example, in keystone-paste.ini) Setting up projects, users, and roles ------------------------------------- You need to minimally define a project, user, and role to link the project and user as the most basic set of details to get other services authenticating and authorizing with Keystone. You will also want to create service users for nova, glance, swift, etc. to be able to use to authenticate users against Keystone. The ``auth_token`` middleware supports using either the shared secret described above as `admin_token` or users for each service. See :doc:`configuration` for a walk through on how to create projects, users, and roles. Setting up services =================== Creating Service Users ---------------------- To configure the OpenStack services with service users, we need to create a project for all the services, and then users for each of the services. We then assign those service users an ``admin`` role on the service project. This allows them to validate tokens - and to authenticate and authorize other user requests. Create a project for the services, typically named ``service`` (however, the name can be whatever you choose): .. code-block:: bash $ openstack project create service Create service users for ``nova``, ``glance``, ``swift``, and ``neutron`` (or whatever subset is relevant to your deployment): .. code-block:: bash $ openstack user create nova --password Sekr3tPass --project service Repeat this for each service you want to enable. Create an administrative role for the service accounts, typically named ``admin`` (however the name can be whatever you choose). For adding the administrative role to the service accounts, you'll need to know the name of the role you want to add. If you don't have it handy, you can look it up quickly with: .. code-block:: bash $ openstack role list Once you have it, grant the administrative role to the service users. This is all assuming that you've already created the basic roles and settings as described in :doc:`configuration`: .. code-block:: bash $ openstack role add admin --project service --user nova Defining Services ----------------- Keystone also acts as a service catalog to let other OpenStack systems know where relevant API endpoints exist for OpenStack Services. The OpenStack Dashboard, in particular, uses this heavily - and this **must** be configured for the OpenStack Dashboard to properly function. The endpoints for these services are defined in a template, an example of which is in the project as the file ``etc/default_catalog.templates``. Keystone supports two means of defining the services, one is the catalog template, as described above - in which case everything is detailed in that template. The other is a SQL backend for the catalog service, in which case after Keystone is online, you need to add the services to the catalog: .. code-block:: bash $ openstack service create compute --name nova \ --description ""Nova Compute Service"" $ openstack service create ec2 --name ec2 \ --description ""EC2 Compatibility Layer"" $ openstack service create image --name glance \ --description ""Glance Image Service"" $ openstack service create identity --name keystone \ --description ""Keystone Identity Service"" $ openstack service create object-store --name swift \ --description ""Swift Service"" Setting Up Auth-Token Middleware ================================ The Keystone project provides the auth-token middleware which validates that the request is valid before passing it on to the application. This must be installed and configured in the applications (such as Nova, Glance, Swift, etc.). The `authentication middleware documentation`_ describes how to install and configure this middleware. .. _`authentication middleware documentation`: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystonemiddleware/middlewarearchitecture.html ",185,236

OpenStack-Ansible is removing support for ubuntu-trusty in master
(Ocata) moving forward. We still need the gate jobs to run against
previous branches (stable/newton, stable/mitaka, liberty).

This patch adjusts the conditional that selects hosts for ubuntu-trusty
jobs, and ensures it only runs against stable/newton and earlier
branches.

Additionally, this patch promotes the xenial AIO job to be voting and
part of the gate for Ocata. This is required for the gate to have a
voting job.

Finally, the xenial non-voting job is skipped by Ocata, in favour of the
voting job. This is to ensure the non-voting job is still run by
stable/newton (which skips the voting job).

The ``message`` should be json-schematized. 2. Each ``message`` should have a specific ``message_type`` corresponding to a specific JSON schema definition. 3. Each message should have the following required fields: * ``message_type`` - the message type. * ``created_at`` - datetime of message creation * ``text`` - human-readable free-form text message 4. It should be possible to filter the image-list by ``message_type``. 5. The image owner should be able to clear the ``message`` field by setting it to ``null`` using a PATCH call. 6. The schema for each ``message_type`` will be defined as part of the ``image`` schema, as illustrated below. .. literalinclude:: extended-image-schema.json :linenos: :language: json Alternatives ^^^^^^^^^^^^ 1. Use an unstructured free text field. This would make parsing difficult and seriously limit the usefulness of the field. 2. As each message overwrites the previous one, thereby causing information loss, the ``message`` field could be a list of messages instead of a unitary message. 3. A message may persist past its usefulness. For example, suppose that a user requests some image operation that fails with an error message, and then does other operations that complete normally. The error message will still be there, which may be confusing to the end user. Maybe a message should also have an ``expires_at`` field that indicates a datetime that the message is subject to automatic deletion. 4. Don't use an image property for this purpose. Instead, do something analogous to the Nova 'os-instance-actions' API, which would make a list of recent actions available at ``GET v2/images/{image_id}/image-actions``. The response for an imported image, for example, could be an image-action object with some wrapping information and then a list of ""events"" (which would basically be the list of messages associated with that import call).

This stops the DVR mixin from overriding the '_update_fip_assoc'
function in order to create its agent floating IP gateway ports.
It instead now subscribes to the floating IP AFTER_UPDATE event
to create these ports.

Additionally, it fixes the semantics of the floating IP AFTER_UPDATE
event so it's emitted after the update is committed to the DB
so it's safe to call core plugin mutation methods and external systems.

In addition to fixing the callback semantics, this is part of the
effort to eliminate GUARD_TRANSACTION in-tree, which
should pave the way for ML2 to adopt the new engine facade and for
push notifications to safely transmit the latest DB state.

Currently when range requests are given as a part of the
HTTP requests for partial downloads of Glance images,
a call to the method ``get_content_range()``
in glance/common/wsgi.py is made. If the request range is
not satisfiable, (For example a bad range like 2-4/3 or 2-/3),
the ``get_content_range()`` method raises a 400 instead of a 416.

Since this method deals only with parsing and returning the
content range header, it is more appropriate for it to raise
a HTTPRequestRangeNotSatisfiable with a status code of 416
instead of a 400.

NOTE: This patch is a break down of tasks of [1] which is
an attempt to ensure that partial downloads are handled
correctly unlike full image downloads.

Changes:

- remove report from task engine;
- remove old logic for hangs and 'idling' statuses;
- increase code redability;
- add code docs;
- support retries in case of MClient errors for status
  and run actions;
- replace timeout raise on usual code;
- descrease waiting time for puppet run (from 120 to 10) and
  time between try (from 30 to 2);
- mcollective retry descrease from 5 to 1. Now it will use
  puppet retries if failed during network/mcollective problem
  after 1 try.

Closes-Bug: #1613396

... by storing SLO Etag and size in sysmeta.

Previously, we had to GET the manifest for every HEAD or conditional
request to an SLO. Worse, since SLO PUTs require that we HEAD every
segment, we'd GET all included sub-SLO manifests. This was necessary so
we could recompute the large object's Etag and content-length.

Since we already know both of those during PUT, we'll now store it in
object sysmeta. This allows us to:

 * satisfy HEAD requests based purely off of the manifest's HEAD
   response, and
 * perform the If-(None-)Match comparison on the object server, without
   any additional subrequests.

Note that the large object content-length can't just be parsed from
content-type -- with fast-POST enabled, the content-type coming out of
the object-server won't necessarily include swift_bytes.

Also note that we must still fall back to GETting the manifest if the
sysmeta headers were not found. Otherwise, we'd break existing large
objects.

When we observe the 'stop timeout' values of pacemaker resources:
rabbitmq and redis, they are set to 90s. But for all other services, it
is set to 200s.
The overcloud deployment sometimes fails due to this with the error:
Error: Could not complete shutdown of rabbitmq-clone, 1 resources remaining
Error performing operation: Timer expired

This patch updates the timeout for Redis and RabbitMQ to avoid this
error.

Note: We already fixed this in puppet-tripleo in master and newton.
This commit aims at making the timeouts the same on all our releases.

With the following two changes we increased the timeout for redis and
rabbit for both starting and stopping to 200s:
https://review.openstack.org/386618 newton (merged)
https://review.openstack.org/385555 master (merged)

We want to also fix that on minor updates on all our supported
releases upstream and downstream (newton, mitaka, liberty, kilo).
This way we can guarantee that we have a uniform timeout for
sart and stop for rabbit and redis across all our releases.

Create the glance-fs Pacemaker resource on one node (pacemaker master)
instead of all nodes, and set verify_on_create to True.

* It will avoid a race condition if Puppet is applied on 2 nodes on the
  same time, so the filesystem is attempted to be created once.

This patch add Mellanox Manager to support Mellanox
InfiniBand NICs.

It adds client_id to the NetworkInterface for the
InfiniBand network interface.

The Mellanox Manager provides it own implementation of
get_interface_info. The mlnx get_interface_info generate
InfiniBand MAC and client-id from the InfiniBand network
interface address.

We previously used body_file_raw, then switch to body_file_seekable
to make it works with wsgiref. But body_file_seekable changes the request
content length. Making the Gnocchi 'content length' different from the
one previously read by the WSGI Server. If the Gnocchi one is smaller
than the WSGI server one. They Gnocchi will read the wsgi.input only
partially. While the WSGI server will not close or reuse the connection
until the wsgi.input have been entirely read. In case of uwsgi, it will
not return the status line neither.

Also these two methods are undocumented, the public API for a file-like
wsgi.input is body_file and it does a ton of crap to read the
wsgi.input correctly.

So just uses body_file.

When a floating ip is associated to a fixed ip, a row in NAT table
is created for the gateway router. When the port with the fixed ip
is deleted without disassociating the fip, the row still remains.
When the same floating ip is associated to a different fixed ip,
a new row is created in the NAT table. This causes the floating ip
unreachable.

In this patch, we first check for the presence of the NAT rule
for the floating ip and if present update the same to the new
fixed ip value.

We also have to explicitly disable the image cache in

nova/* were copied from nova-docker with minor\nmodification (mainly for fixing bugs and removing unused codes).\nIn particular, nova/virt/docker/driver.py contains a DockerDriver\nfor Nova. It implements the Nova virt driver interface using docker.\nThis custom virt driver is used to create/delete/manage sandbox\ncontainers.\n\nThe devstack plugin will install the custom virt driver in Nova,\nand configure nova to use it. In particular, in\ndevstack/override-defaults, the variable VIRT_DRIVER is overrided\nto ""docker"" so that the devstack will pick up the script\ndevstack/lib/nova_plugins/hypervisor-docker to install, configure,\nand uninstall the virt driver.\n\nAfter this commit, creating a container will (i) create a Nova\ninstance (with custom virt driver) as a sandbox, and (ii) create\nanother container by using the sandbox. Each driver must implement\nadditional methods to create/delete/manage sandboxes. The driver\ninterface is declared in zun/container/driver.py .\n\nIn file zun/container/docker/driver.py, the DockerDriver implements\nthe sandboxes operations by using Nova. In particular, the method\ncreate_sandbox will call nova api to boot an instance and wait until\nthe instance is created.

The files under nova/* were copied from nova-docker with minor
modification (mainly for fixing bugs and removing unused codes).
In particular, nova/virt/docker/driver.py contains a DockerDriver
for Nova. It implements the Nova virt driver interface using docker.
This custom virt driver is used to create/delete/manage sandbox
containers.

The devstack plugin will install the custom virt driver in Nova,
and configure nova to use it. In particular, in
devstack/override-defaults, the variable VIRT_DRIVER is overrided
to ""docker"" so that the devstack will pick up the script
devstack/lib/nova_plugins/hypervisor-docker to install, configure,
and uninstall the virt driver.

After this commit, creating a container will (i) create a Nova
instance (with custom virt driver) as a sandbox, and (ii) create
another container by using the sandbox. Each driver must implement
additional methods to create/delete/manage sandboxes. The driver
interface is declared in zun/container/driver.py .

In file zun/container/docker/driver.py, the DockerDriver implements
the sandboxes operations by using Nova. In particular, the method
create_sandbox will call nova api to boot an instance and wait until
the instance is created. The method delete_sandbox will call nova
to delete the instance and wait until the instance is deleted.

In file zun/compute/manager.py, in _do_container_create, it invokes
the driver API to create a sandbox first, then it invokes the driver
API again to create a container inside the sandbox. The sandbox_id
is set to container metadata and persisted to db, so that later we
can retrieve the sandbox from container object. For example, when
deleting the contaner, the sandbox_id is needed for cleanup.

At this commit, we hardcoded the flavor to m1.small and nics to
'auto' when creating sandbox instances. We might make them as
parameters and specified by end-users. The flavor will decide the
resource constraints of the container and nics will decide how the
networking of the container being configured. The docker image
kubernetes/pause is chosen to be the image of the sandbox container,
since its size is small and statisfies what we want (an empty
container that keeps running).

When creating the sandbox, we haven't specify the security group yet
so the default security group is used. Users need to open ports in
that security groups to access container from outside. Later, we
could create a custom security group for each container, and
automatically open ports that are exposed by the container.
