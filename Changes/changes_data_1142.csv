Problem description =================== Currently in Nova, what kind of cpu model exposed for guest vcpu is depended the host configuration. There are two options cpu_mode and cpu_model which defined cpu model of guest running on specific host. This ways isn't flexible and didn't utilize the resource effective. For example, there is new host with new cpu model add to the cluster. But for support live migration between the new host and old host, the operator have to set the cpu model to the old one which compatible with other host by CONF.libvirt.cpu_model. This lose the chance to expose new cpu feature to the user. But if the operator enable the host expose its new cpu model, some instances schedule to the new host, but they needn't the new features, and at same time they lose the chance of live migration. Although nova scheduler support ComputeCapabilitiesFilter which allow to schedule instance based on cpu capabilities. But that filter only ensure the host cpu capabilites match the requirement, can't ensure what cpu capabilities expose to the guest, because the cpu model expose to the guest controled by CONF.libvirt.cpu_mode and CONF.libvirt.cpu_model. Another proble is resource utilization. The new host with new cpu model didn't means only the new cpu model instance can be scheduled on. The instance with old cpu model also can be scheduled on new host also. Use Cases ---------- * When the new host add to the cluster, the operator can ensure the instance will boot up with compatible cpu model between most of hosts. * When the new host add to the cluster, the operator can create flavor or image which enable some user get chance to utilize the new cpu capabilities. * Operator can control which host can passthrough the cpu to the guess, and control only the instance have such requirement can scheduled on host with CONFIG.libvirt.cpu_mode=host-passthrough Project Priority ----------------- Does this blueprint fit under one of the :ref:`kilo-priorities`? If so which one and how? Proposed change =============== The flavor extra specs will be enhanced to support several new parameters: * hw:cpu_mode=none|custom|host-model|host-passthrough * 'none': This is the default value. Nova will keep the behavor as before. * 'host-model': This means the instance can be schedule on the host which CONF.libvirt.cpu_mode is 'custom' or 'host-model'. * 'custom': This totally is equal 'host-model'. Support this just for consistent. * 'host-passthrough': This means the instance can be scheduled on the host which CONF.libvirt.cpu_mode is 'host-passthrough'. * hw:cpu_model=<cpu model, for example: Haswell> This specific the instance required cpu model. * hw:cpu_model_match=minimum|exact * 'minimum': This is the default option. The guest cpu model at least was the model specified by 'hw:cpu_model'. If the host cpu model level higher than that, the higher level cpu will be exposed to the guest also. * 'exact': The guest cpu model will be exactly equals the 'hw:cpu_model'. The host must at least support this model, and if there is any features more than that will be hided. Alternativee ------------ What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one. Data model impact ----------------- This blueprint propose add new fields to the guest cpu model object: :: class VirtCPUModel: fields = { 'mode' = fields.EnumField(nullable=True, valid_values=cpumodel.ALL_CPUMODES), 'match' = fields.EnumField(nullable=True, valid_values=cpumodel.ALL_MATCHES), 'model' = fields.ObjectField('CPUModel') } * mode: This is means which cpu mode enable for this instance. * match: This means how to match cpu model. * model: When boot new instance, this field store the which cpu_model is requested. REST API impact --------------- No Impact Security impact --------------- No Impact Notifications impact -------------------- No Impact Other end user impact --------------------- No Impact Performance Impact ------------------ No Impact Other deployer impact --------------------- TODO Developer impact ---------------- No Impact Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Alex Xu <hejie.xu@intel.com> Other contributors: Jiang, Yunhong<hejie.xu@intel.com> Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Dependencies ============ * Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in nova, or in other projects, that this one either depends on or is related to. * If this requires functionality of another project that is not currently used by Nova (such as the glance v2 API when we previously only required v1), document that fact. * Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not included in OpenStack? Or does it depend on a specific version of library? Testing ======= Please discuss the important scenarios needed to test here, as well as specific edge cases we should be ensuring work correctly. For each scenario please specify if this requires specialized hardware, a full openstack environment, or can be simulated inside the Nova tree. Please discuss how the change will be tested. We especially want to know what tempest tests will be added. It is assumed that unit test coverage will be added so that doesn't need to be mentioned explicitly, but discussion of why you think unit tests are sufficient and we don't need to add more tempest tests would need to be included. Is this untestable in gate given current limitations (specific hardware / software configurations available)? If so, are there mitigation plans (3rd party testing, gate enhancements, etc). Documentation Impact ==================== What is the impact on the docs team of this change? Some changes might require donating resources to the docs team to have the documentation updated. Don't repeat details discussed above, but please reference them here. References ========== Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any reference. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are: * Links to mailing list or IRC discussions * Links to notes from a summit session * Links to relevant research, if appropriate * Related specifications as appropriate (e.g. if it's an EC2 thing, link the EC2 docs) * Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to ",,222,0

See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License. Policies ======== A policy is a wrapper of a collection of rules that will be checked/enforced when Senlin performs some operations on the objects it manages. The design goals of policy support in Senlin are flexibility and customizability. We strive to make the policies flexible so that we can accommodate diverse types of policies for various usage scenarios. We also want to make policy type developement an easier task for developers to introduce new policies and/or customize existing ones for their needs. ----------------- Policy Properties ----------------- A policy object has the following properties: - ``id``: a string containing the globally unique ID for the object; - ``name``: a string containing the name of the policy object; - ``type``: a string containing the name of the policy type; - ``spec``: a map containing the validated specification for the object; - ``cooldown``: an integer representing the default policy cooldown in seconds. - ``level``: an integer that specifies default enforcement level of the policy when it is checked/enforced; - ``created_time``: timestamp of the object creation; - ``updated_time``: timestamp of last update to the object; - ``deleted_time``: timestamp of the object deletion; a non-empty value indicates that the object has been deleted; - ``data``: a map containing some private data for the policy object; The policy enforcement levels are defined as an integer. Some predefined values for the levels are: - ``MUST`` (50): the policy must be enforced. A violation may render the cluster not functional and Senlin has no known way of recovery. - ``SHOULD`` (40): the policy should be enforced. A violation of a policy at this level will render the cluster into an ``ERROR`` status. Manual intervention to recover the cluster might be possible. - ``WOULD`` (30): the policy would be enforced, but a violation of this policy may or may not cause negative impact on the cluster. A cluster will be put into a ``WARNING`` status so that operators will notice this. - ``MIGHT`` (20): the policy might be enforced but it is not a requirement. A violation of a policy at this level will not cause any negative impact to the related cluster. There would be some ``INFO`` or ``DEBUG`` level events generated when this policy is enforced. ----------------- Creating A Policy ----------------- When the Senlin API receives a request to create a policy object, it first checks if the JSON body contains a map named ``policy`` that has the ``name``, ``type`` and ``spec`` keys and values associated with them. If any of these keys are missing, the request will be treated as an invalid one and rejected. After the preliminary request validation done at the Senlin API layer, Senlin engine will further check whether the specified policy type does exists and whether the specified ``spec`` can pass the validation logic in the policy type implementation. If this phase of validation is successful, a policy object will be created and saved into the database, then a map containing the details of the object will be returned to the requester. If any of these validations fail, an error message will be returned to the requester instead. ---------------- Listing Policies ---------------- Policy objects can be listed using the Senlin API. When querying the policy objects, a user can specify the following query parameters, individually or combined: - ``filters``: a map containing key-value pairs that will be used for matching policy records. Records that fail to match this criteria will be filtered out. The following strings are valid keys: * ``name``: name of policies to list, can be a string or a list of strings; * ``type``: type name of policies, can be a string or a list of strings; * ``level``: enforcement level of policies, can be an integer of a list of integers; * ``cooldown``: cooldown value of policies, can be an integer of a list of integers; * ``created_time``: timestamp when the object was created; * ``updated_time``: timestamp when the policy object was last updated; * ``deleted_time``: timestamp when the policy object was deleted; - ``limit``: a number that restricts the maximum number of records to be returned from the query. It is useful for displaying the records in pages where the page size can be specified as the limit. - ``marker``: A string that represents the last seen UUID of policies in previous queries. This query will only return results appearing after the specified UUID. This is useful for displaying records in pages. - ``sort_dir``: A string to enforce sorting of the results. It can accept either ``asc`` or ``desc`` as its value. - ``sort_keys``: A string or a list of strings where each string gives a policy property name used for sorting. - ``show_deleted``: A boolean indicating whether deleted policies should be included in the results. The default is False. The Senlin API performs some basic checks on the data type and values of the provided parameters and then passes the request to Senlin engine. When there are policy objects matching the query criteria, a list of policy objects is returned to the requester. If there is no matching record, the result will be an empty list. ---------------- Getting A Policy ---------------- A user can provide one of the UUID, the name or the short ID of policy object to the Senlin API ``policy_show`` to retrieve the details about a policy. If a policy object matching the criteria is found, Senlin API returns the object details in a map; if more than one object is found, Senlin API returns an error message telling users that there are multiple choices; if no object is found matching the criteria, a different error message will be returned to the requester. ----------------- Updating A Policy ----------------- After a policy is created, a user can send requests to the Senlin API for changing some of its properties. To avoid potential state conflicts inside the Senlin engine, we currently don't allow changes to the ``type`` or the ``spec`` property of a policy. However, changing the ``name``, ``cooldown`` or ``level`` property is permitted. When validating the requester provided parameters, Senlin API will check if the values are of valid data types and whether the values fall in allowed ranges. After this validation, the request is forwarded to Senlin engine for processing. Senlin engine will try to find the policy using the specified policy identity as the UUID, the name or a short ID of the policy object. When no matching object is found or more than one object is found, an error message is returned to the user. Otherwise, the engine updates the object property and returns the object details in a map. ----------------- Deleting A Policy ----------------- A user can specify the UUID, the name or the short ID of a policy object when sending a ``policy_delete`` request to the Senlin API. Senlin engine will try to find the matching policy object using the specified identity as the UUID, the name or a short ID of the policy object. When no matching object is found or more than one object is found, an error message is returned. Otherwise, the API returns a 204 status to the requester indicating that the deletion was successful. To prevent deletion of policies that are still in use by any clusters, the Senlin engine will try find if any bindings exist between the specified policy and a cluster. An error message will be returned to the requester if such a binding is found. ",,175,0

Currently, rbd driver in cinder does not manage properly glance images with
multiple locations when creating a volume from image.

With multi-location feature in glance, a image can have multiple rbd URIs
associated, even in different ceph clusters. When rbd driver tries to create a
volume as a CoW clone from the image, it only check the direct_url URI instead
of all available locations for the image.

This patch iterates over both direct_url and locations URIs looking for a
clonable one.

When I implemented the new target driver code the
methods used for LVM were copy pasted:
 commit 9651f547147188645942466602c92cce06666483

I screwed this up because the block_device driver
doesn't use LVM at all.

This patch sets it back the way it should be and just
uses the local dev file of the whole disk.

This patch provides policy cooldown support. The following works
were done in this patch:

1. Cooldown check and reset methods were implemented in policy base
   module;
2. Add policy cooldown examination with the following logic:
    - cooldown check will be done before invoking policy.pre_op() if
      policy targets on 'BEFORE' stage of current action;
    - cooldown check will be done before invoking policy.post_op() if
      policy targets on 'AFTER' stage of current action;
    - cooldown check will be skipped if policy doesn't target to any
      stage of current action;
3. Add policy cooldown reset with the following logic:
    - cooldown timestamp will be reset when action execution finished
      if policy targets on 'BEFORE' or 'AFTER' stage of current action;
    - cooldown timestamp will not be updated if policy doesn't target
      to any stage of current action;

This has been broken for a while, but made more obvious by
recent changes to parallelize tests.

Also remove all the extra reset calls we added to work around
this problem over time.

Changes [1,2] introduced test hooks and minimized dependencies
on the openstack-infra job configuration for ODL.

This change follows up to ensure that what used to be configured
and run thanks to the yaml configuration is still effective, but
driven differently.

In particular this change does:

* Ensure that certain services are enabled.
* Remove the pre-test hook script as it's not in use yet.
* Introduce the post-test hook script to run tests as we see fit.

This commit moves the L2 agents (Linuxbridge and OVS) into the
ML2 directory, while at the same time also moving the ML2 server
bits into toplevel directories. It also moves the configuration
files and unit tests. We also move the l2pop RPC mixin while
here as well.

The minimal nodes count is 5 for the current implementation and HA mode (1 master, 3 controllers, 1 compute/storage). The requirement is a 2 node cluster should be supported with possibility to migrate Fuel master node to VM. Problem description =================== In some cases user want to deploy OpenStack with Fuel in small environment. This will not deliver production ready setup, but allow to play and test OpenStack and Fuel itself. This require to support 2 baremetal server deployments. All reduced deployments should be capable to be migrated to proper HA setup. After deployment, user should have possibility to migrate Fuel to VM, and use Mirantis OpenStack on single physical machine. Proposed change =============== Allow user to create additional virtual machines (KVM) on single physical machine. This should be possible by assigning compute role to physical server, after that user should have possibility to click ""create N virtual machines"". These machines will be treated by Fuel as standard bare metal servers. We should also prepare procedure/documentation how to move running Fuel to virtual machine running on our bare metal. Deployment flow: - Install Fuel on baremetal/virtual machine (#1) - Boot another bare metal (#2) server via Fuel PXE - Create new environment in Fuel - Assign compute role to bare metal (#2) - Create new virtual machines on compute (#2) - Provision new virtual machines (#3) - Assign controller roles to virtual machines (#3) - Deploy environment - Migrate Fuel server (#1) as additional virtual machine located on physical server (#2) Alternatives ------------ Allow to assign compute and controller role to single machine. Cons: - No possibility to deploy environment in full HA on single node. Pros: - Better performance. - Easy implementation. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- None Security impact --------------- In this scenario controller is located in KVM on computes where tenants VMs are running. This can lead to unknown security vulnerabilities. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- When user want to use virtual machines as controller, he should run additional steps before deployment: - Create virtual machines. - Provision environment. - Deploy environment. Performance Impact ------------------ Running all OpenStack components on single physical machine in KVM will lead to bad performance. But we should remember that solution is not production ready. This is only testbed/playground for real workloads. Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Bartosz Kupidura (zynzel) Work Items ---------- Implement new task in nailgun to create virtual machines on compute when choosen. Add new action in webUI which allows to provision servers before deployment. Add new action in webUI which allows to add new virtual servers on given compute node. Create procedure/documentation how to move installed Fuel node to virtual machine located on compute. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= ??? Documentation Impact ==================== We need to prepare new section in documentation describing new feature and proper flow of deployment.

Currently the rbd class configures Nova so that it uses the
rbd driver for both the ephemeral and the persistent storage.
One might want to use it to attach Cinder volumes (persistent)
but not for the ephemeral storage instead, which be on local
disks or even backed by a different driver.

This change adds a parameter to control use of rbd driver for
the ephemeral storage, setting it to true by default to
preserve the old behavior.

Currently get_gateway() of IpRouteCommand class always assumes
the presence of gateway_ip when default_route is seen.
Since we can also have interface routes without the gw_ip,
this patch fixes the issue by parsing the output accordingly.

SubnetRequestFactory incorporates logic for preparing arguments and
building right request.
Subnet dict, context and subnetpool are used to make decision on
what kind of reqest should be created.
SubnetRequestFactory can be overriden on ipam driver level,
it allows to easily extend existent Request model.

The feature will enhance debugging capabilities of all Ceilometer services, by providing an easy and convenient way to collect debug data about current threads and configuration, among other things, to developers, operators, and tech support in production deployments. Problem description =================== Currently, Ceilometer doesn't provide a way to collect state data from active service processes. The only information that is available to deployers, developers, and tech support is what was actually logged by the service. Additional data could be usefully used to debug and solve problems that occur during Ceilometer operation. We could be interested in stack traces of green and real threads, pid/ppid info, package version, configuration as seen by the service, etc. Oslo Guru Meditation Reports provide an easy way to add support for collecting the live state info from any service. Report generation is triggered by sending a special(USR1) signal to a service. Reports are generated on stderr, and can be piped into system log based on need. Nova has supported Oslo Guru Meditation Reports. Proposed change =============== First, a new oslo-incubator module (reports.*) should be synchronized into neutron tree. Then, each service process needs to initialize the error report system before the process executes launch method in the main function. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- This feature could expose service internals to someone who is able to send the needed signal to a service. That said, we can probably assume that the operator is already authorized to achieve a lot more than just having an access to stack traces and configuration used. Of course, if deployers are afraid of the information leak for some reason, they could also make sure their stderr output is channeled into safe place. Pipeline impact --------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance/Scalability Impacts ------------------------------- The feature does not require any additional resources until it's triggered by the user and reports are not expected to be generated too often, so it has little impact on performance and scalability. Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: zhangtralon Work Items ---------- * sync reports.* module from oslo-incubator * adopt it in all heat services under ceilometer/cmd/ Future lifecycle ================ None Dependencies ============ Currently, the reports.* module from oslo-incubator is graduating into oslo.reports in Library. In case it's graduated into oslo.reports before Ceilometer switches to it, we will not need to synchronize the reports.* module. Testing ======= The Oslo Guru Meditation Reports has been tested in the oslo-incubator. Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation should be extended to describe the new feature.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================================== Track DBaaS(Trove) Notifications ==================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/track-dbaas-notifications The goal of this blueprint is to capture the notification events emitted by Trove (DBaaS) during create, modify volume, resize, delete operations and periodic exist events. Problem description =================== Trove is Database as a Service for OpenStack. It automates the creation, configuration and management of relational or non-relational database without the burden of handling complex administrative tasks. The trove-taskmanager service dispatches tasks such as provisioning database instances, managing the lifecycle of database instances, and performing operations on the database instance and emits notification event for each such task. These notifications are CRUD events, that notify the creation, update or modification of a trove instance and its underlying volume, and also have measurement values such as instance size and volume size. Ceilometer needs to be updated to consume and record these notifications as samples and events (traits). From Trove perspective they are running instances of a database, not compute instances. Metering and billing will be based on hours that the database has been running, not necessarily how long the hosting instance has been run. This requires a unique set of metering records(samples) to be generated and stored to enable usage tracking and billing of the individual database instances. If Ceilometer processes and record these notifications, other services will be able to use this for aggregation and billing purpose. Proposed change =============== To represent as events, define event definitions and field mappings (trait definitions) for Trove resource type - instance in the /etc/ceilometer/event_definitions.yaml file. The trait field syntax in trait definitions follow a variant of the JSONPath. Example of the event definition and field mappings for the domain notifications that need to go in event_definitions.yaml, - event_type: trove.instance.* - traits: &trove_traits - instance_size: - fields: payload.instance_size - resource_id: - fields: payload.instance_id - instance_name: - fields: payload.instance_name - nova_instance_id: - fields: payload.nova_instance_id - created_at: - fields: payload.created_at - launched_at: - fields: payload.launched_at - volume_size: - fields: payload.volume_size - volume_id: - fields: payload.nova.volume_id - modify_at: - fields: payload.modify_at - deleted_at: - fields: payload.deleted_at To enable event processing in Ceilometer, configuration is needed in ceilometer.conf, * Configure store_events as True under the notification section, eg - [notification] store_events = True * Specify the event_definitions file name under the event section, eg - [event] definitions_cfg_file = event_definitions.yaml Using events provides better querying of metadata and avoids the effort to aggregate samples with a fixed measurement value of 1. To represent as samples, a notification plugin is required in Ceilometer, to hear notifications at an exchange and topic and transform them into samples. This is needed to account for the database uptime hours, which is based on the trove.instance.exists event. Specifically, the audit_period_beginning and audit_period_ending for each exists event will be used to compute the uptime hours A counter type - database can be used to associate the trove samples Add a new listener class - TroveMetricsNotificationBase that extends plugin.NotificationBase for DBaaS service to transform Trove event data into samples A sub-class of TroveMetricsNotificationBase that emits samples for the trove.instance.create and trove.instance.exists events and another for the trove.instance.modify* and trove.instance.delete events The Trove event types have the following pattern, * trove.<resource>.create * trove.<resource>.modify_volume * trove.<resource>.modify_flavor * trove.<resource>.delete * trove.<resource>.exists , where resource is instance. Alternatives ------------ Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Pipeline impact --------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance/Scalability Impacts ------------------------------- No new impacts. Pre-existing concerns with capacity at the notification and storage handling layers remain. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: rjaiswal Ongoing maintainer: rjaiswal Work Items ---------- * Event definitions and field mappings for all supported Trove resource types. * Event validation. * Trove Notifications Listener class to process create/update/delete/exists events for trove instance. * Test coverage for the above listener class and sample validation. Future lifecycle ================ There could be new types of notifications when new resource types are added or new features are supported like backup/restore, patching, monitoring etc. When Trove confirms with the PaaS event format, the field mappings for integrated events will need to be refactored to adjust to the new event format. With the impending move towards declarative metering in Ceilometer, the proposed notification plugin for Trove will become redundant/deprecated and replaced with declarative meter definitions. Dependencies ============ DBaaS is construed as a PaaS service by some and might have it own message bus where it is sending notifications. Ceilometer recently was extended to consume notification from multiple message bus - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/77612/ If there are multiple message buses, then ceilometer will need multiple transport endpoints configured in ceilometer configuration. (ceilometer.conf) Testing ======= Unit and integration Tests will be added to validate events generated. Documentation Impact ==================== None.

Problem description =================== Currently, we use a generic snmp hardware inspector and a python dict which defines the mapping between snmp oid/operations and the metrics value the caller wants(See the following link for the description of that mapping). https://github.com/openstack/ceilometer/blob/stable/kilo/ceilometer/hardware/inspector/snmp.py#L112 On top of that generic snmp inspector, we still have separate hardware pollsters doing things like setting multiple fields in the Sample object. It's ok to add a dozen of new metrics. But if want to add hundreds of new snmp metrics, we need to do it in a declarative way, instead of writing new pollster code for every new snmp metrics added. Proposed change =============== While keeping the current snmp related hardware.* pollsters intact for backward compatibility, we'll add a new generic snmp pollster, which can return different types of snmp related metrics based on user request. This generic snmp pollster will load a definition from a yaml definition file which defines the parameters used to call into the generic snmp inspector, and also other fields in the final Sample object the pollster returns. The yaml definition would be something like the followings:: --- - sample_name: hardware.cpu.load.15min sample_unit: process sample_type: gauge snmp_inspector: matching_type: type_exact, oid: ""1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1"", type: float metadata: { } post_op: - sample_name: hardware.network.incoming.bytes sample_unit: B sample_type: cumulative snmp_inspector: matching_type: type_prefix metric_oid: ""1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10"" metadata: { name: { oid: ""1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2"", type: ""str"", }, speed: { oid: ""1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5"", type: ""lambda x: int(x) / 8"", }, } post_op: ""_post_op_net"" Please see the following link for the detailed explanation of the snmp_inspector dict in the definition: https://github.com/openstack/ceilometer/blob/stable/kilo/ceilometer/hardware/inspector/snmp.py#L112 When adding new snmp metrics, we only needs to add the new definitions into the yaml definition. No need to writing new code. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Pipeline impact --------------- Because the new generic snmp pollster could return multiple different types of samples, it would bring the following changes to the pipeline: Support new meters definition in the pipeline source configuration ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The new meters definition would be like:: --- sources: - name: snmp_cpuload interval: 600 meters: - snmp://hardware.cpu.load.* sinks: - snmp_sink This means the snmp generic pollster would return all the samples starting with the name hardware.cpu.load. Enhance the SampleSource.support_meter() method ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The SampleSource.support_meter() method need to be able to decide whether the sample is actually returned by the snmp pollsters as it defined in the pipeline.

This change adjusts the exception message to be more in line with the
version compatibility algorithm so as to accurately portray the
problem to the log recipient.

The RPCVersionCapError message can be grossly incorrect when the
requested message's major version is lower than the specified version
cap's major version, declaring the requested message version as too
high, when the real error is that the major versions differ (as major
versions are assumed to be incompatible).

Example:

    RPCVersionCapError: Requested message version, 3.23 is too
    high. It needs to be lower than the specified version cap 4.0.

Currently, sqlalchemy.ModelBase.__contains__() catches any exception,
and by doing that, it hides real bugs. For example, a Nova unit test
raises the following error, but __contains__() simply returns False:

    sqlalchemy.orm.exc.DetachedInstanceError: Parent instance
    <InstanceExtra at 0x7fea635bc5f8> is not bound to a Session;
    deferred load operation of attribute 'pci_requests' cannot proceed

On Python 3, hasattr() calls getattr(): it returns True if getattr()
succeeds, False if getattr() raises an AttributeError, or passes
through the exception, if getattr() failed for a different reason.

On Python 2, hasattr() also calls getattr(), but it catches *any*
exception.

This change replaces hasattr() with getattr(), and it only catches
AttributeError as Python 3, so passes through sqlalchemy exceptions.

Add an unit test to test the new behaviour.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================================== Add is_domain to the token for projects acting as a domain ========================================================== `bp add-isdomain-to-token <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/add-isdomain-to-token>`_ For project scoped tokens that are issued for a project acting as a domain, the token should also contain is_domain=true. Problem Description =================== In policy files today, the creation of concepts such as ""domain admin"" rely on the use of domain scoped tokens. Support for domain tokens doesn't really exist outside keystone (even in horizon), which is problematic. We have already discussed (and rejected) dual scoped tokens (i.e. a token which contains both a project ID and domain ID, both set to the same ID). However, the problem still remains. Proposed Change =============== This proposal is to simply add is_domain=true to any token that is issued for a project that is acting as a domain. With that change, it would then be possible to write policy rules that today require a domain token, to instead work with regular project tokens, while still providing the same level of protection. For example, the a typical policy rule of: ""identity:create_user"": ""rule:admin_required and domain_id:%(user.domain_id)s"" would be replaced with ""identity:create_user"": ""rule:admin_required and project_id:%(user.domain_id)s and is_domain:True"" This simply change would allow an entire policy file to be re-written to never require domain scoped tokens, paving the way for their eventual removal.

Data Model Impact ----------------- None REST API Impact --------------- None Security Impact --------------- None Notifications Impact -------------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- To take advantage of this, deployers would have to change their policy files.

When HA router is created, the framework creates a network and does
not specify the tenant-id. This casuse Arista ML2 driver to fail.
This patch sets the tenant-id when it is not passed explicitly by
by the network_create() call from the HA router framework.

Even though original issue was discovered for network_create()
it turns out the same issue applies for port_create() as well
so all the methods are fixed in this patch

To prevent 409 conflict on a primary node during ssyncing,
ssync-receiver should add x-ssync-backend-frag-index generated from
x-ssync-backend-node-index of the SSYNC replication request header.
The change is done by previous work[1], but we need more test for that.

This patch addes one more assertion if the x-ssync-backend-frag-index
is in the ssync subrequest correctly.

*BONUS*
Fix some weird mock and add some sanities.

Add optional on_execute and on_completion callbacks to allow callers of
procesutils.execute() to track process completion asynchronously.

This could be used to cache the pid of long running tasks associated
with an instance and then clear the cache when the process completes.
While the tasks are running should it be required the pid retrieved and
the process can be signaled.

Add PoolWeigher which enumerate all of the pools that have existing
share_servers and give those pools a value of 1 while all the other
pools should have a value of 0.

Config option pool_weight_multiplier can be used to increase the
priority of scheduling shares on pools with existing share_servers.

Commit Icff37261b367463b71a1268be16f9c97f595bf0c brought bugs in
backup.rpcapi. For export_record, import_record and reset_status
backup.id is passed instead of whole backup object - which
backup.manager expects. This causes severe failures. This commit
changes the rpcapi to pass objects and adds missing
backup.test_rpcapi unit tests that will prevent such failures in

Manila has ""share types"", analogous to Cinder ""volume types"", that
may contain qualified extra-specs - extra-specs that have significance
only for the backend driver and which are not reported back to the
scheduler.

This commit adds the following boolean qualified extra-specs:
  * netapp:dedup
  * netapp:compression
alongside preexisting support for the netapp:thin_provisioned boolean
qualified extra spec.

which will result in a 2.0.0 of that package, but there should be an
oslo.config 1.12.2 release which has a block on oslo.i18n 2.0.0 so the
unit tests actually work.

The check introduced by I79b38a354dd85f58a7c16b34661bff02d9170a9f
is supposed to verify that a service that is being launched is an
instance of service.ServiceBase abstract base class.
However in some projects services are launched by instantiating a
launcher (ServiceLauncher or ProcessLauncher) and then directly
calling its launch_service method. In this case the check never executes.

This change moves the base class check into a separate function that is
being called by launch_service methods of the both launcher classes.

An existing example of filtering in `Nova <http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/specs/api/networking_general_api_information.html#filtering-and-column-selection>`_ It is notable that Nova doesn't support have support for OR filters, requiring separate requests per query. A different strategy is to specify query objects and pass them as a single URL-encoded JSON list. This is lest client-friendly because it requires extra encoding steps. The simplest way to allow filtering is to map filterable parameters to query parameters. Take the sample object:: GET /app/items { ""items"": [ { ""foo"": ""bar"", ""baz"": ""quux"" }, { ""foo"": ""buzz"", ""baz"": ""honk"" } ] } To filter on a field, simply add that field and its value to the query.:: GET /app/items?foo=buzz { ""items"": [ { ""foo"": ""buzz"", ""baz"": ""honk"" } ] } Multiple filters result in an implicit AND, so in our example ``/app/items?foo=buzz&baz=quux`` would provide no results. **TODO** Add section on more complex queries including 'like', regex, and ranges. Paginating responses should be done *after* applying the filters in a query, because it's possible for the first page to contain no matches. ",,47,0

OpenStack projects currently do not delete tenant resources when a tenant
is deleted. For example, a user registers to a public cloud, and a script
auto generates a Keystone user and tenant, along with a Neutron router and
a tenant network. Later, the user changes his mind and removes his
subscription from the service. An admin deletes the tenant, yet the router
and network remain, with a tenant id of a tenant that no longer exists.
This issue can cause ballooning databases and operational issues for
long-standing clouds.

The blueprint proposes the ability to listen to Keystone tenant delete
notifications and sending delete calls for each tenant resources.
Additionally, we'll expose a new CLI tool that deletes a tenant, or
delete tenants that don't appear in Keystone. The CLI tool can be set
up as a cron job.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =========================================== Clean up resources when a tenant is deleted =========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/tenant-delete Problem description =================== OpenStack projects currently do not delete tenant resources when a tenant is deleted. For example, a user registers to a public cloud, and a script auto generates a Keystone user and tenant, along with a Neutron router and a tenant network. Later, the user changes his mind and removes his subscription from the service. An admin deletes the tenant, yet the router and network remain, with a tenant id of a tenant that no longer exists. This issue can cause ballooning databases and operational issues for long-standing clouds. Proposed change =============== 1) The ability to configure Neutron to listen and react to Keystone tenant deletion events, by sending a delete on each orphaned resource. 2) Expose an admin CLI tool that either accepts a tenant-id and deletes its resources, or finds all tenants with left-over resources and deletes them. It does this by listing tenants in Keystone and deletes any resources not belonging to those tenants. Alternatives ------------ Should the events be reacted upon? According to the principle of least surprise, I think an admin would expect tenant resources to be deleted when he deletes a tenant, and not have to invoke a CLI tool manually, or set up a cron job. Currently Keystone does not emit notifications by default, which poses a challenge. I'll try to change the default in Keystone, as well as make Neutron listen and react by default. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- Neutron will now be willing to accept RPC messages in a well known format, deleting user data. Notifications impact -------------------- Configuration changes to listen to the same exchange and topic as Keystone notifications. Other end user impact --------------------- See documentation section. Performance Impact ------------------ Deleting all tenant resources is a costly operation and should probably be turned off for scale purposes. A cron job can be setup to perform clean up during off hours. Other deployer impact --------------------- | Keystone needs to be configured to emit notifications via (Non-default): | notification_driver = messaging | The following keys need to match in keystone.conf in the general section, and neutron.conf in the [identity] section: | control_exchange = openstack | notification_topics = notifications They match by default. The new neutron-delete-tenant executable may be configured as a cron job. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Assaf Muller Work Items ---------- 1) Make Neutron listen to Keystone notifications. 2) Implement a callback that accepts a tenant id and deletes all of its resources. This will be implemented as a new service plugin. 3) Implement a CLI tool that detects ""orphaned"" tenants and deletes all of their resources, while reusing code from step 2. Note that Neutron has intra-dependencies. For example, you can not delete a network with active ports. This means that resources need to be deleted in specific order. Shared resources need to be dealt with in a special manner: If there are multiple tenants that need to be deleted, (IE: More than one orphaned tenant), the solution is to delete resources breadth first, and not tenant by tenant. IE: First delete all ports by all tenants, then all networks. An issue remains if the admin tries to delete a tenant with a shared network without first deleting another tenant with ports belonging to the shared network. The non-shared resources will be successfully deleted but the shared network will not. At this point the first tenant will have a network which was not cleaned up and has no reason to be deleted, unless at some point in the future the active ports will be deleted, then the CLI tool may be used with the --automatic flag. I'm fine with this deficiency. Dependencies ============ I want to make Keystone emit notifications by default. Testing ======= I think unit tests are not the correct level to test this feature. What we need is both functional and integration tests. Functional tests are currently proposed as ""unit"" tests: Like a significant amount of currently implemented unit tests, these are in fact functional tests, making actual API calls to an in-memory DB. This is the current proposal for the Neutron side of things: Make API calls to create resources under a certain tenant, import the Identity service plugin and ""delete"" the tenant. At this point assertions will be made to verify that the previously created resources are now gone. Maru has been leading an effort [1] to move these type of tests to the functional tree and CI job, as well as make calls directly to the plugins and not via the API. There remains an open question if this blueprint should depend on Maru's, placing more focus on Maru's efforts, which is missing a framework that enables calls to the plugins for all types of resources. What would still be missing is coverage for the Keystone to Neutron notifications, and this would obviously belong to Tempest. This would require a configuration change to the gate, as Keystone does not emit notifications by default. Finally, I propose that the --automatic functionality of the CLI tool would be tested in Neutron, by mocking out the call to Keystone. Reminder: The CLI tool makes an API call to get a Keystone tenant list, then goes through the resources in Neutron, deleting orphaned resources. The mock would return a predetermined list of tenants. Note: I propose to test the 'automatic' functionality of the Identity service plugin directly, not via the CLI tool. Documentation Impact ==================== There will be new configuration options in neutron.conf, as well as a new CLI tool to delete left over resources. | neutron.conf: | [identity] | control_exchange = openstack | notification_topics = notifications | CLI tool: | neutron-delete-tenant --tenant-id=<tenant_id> --automatic Either --tenant-id or --automatic must be specified, but not both. --automatic deletes resources by tenants that are no longer known by Keystone.

Commit 390fab8da43339e04dae511b5a8bf4a6235cb8ea changed how nova.conf is
generated via the tox genconfig target, however, it fails to load the
'versionutils' namespace entry from nova-config-generator.conf since
nova.openstack.common.versionutils does not exist. The versionutils
module is now in oslo.utils rather than oslo-incubator. That was removed
in commit 2233675941c075c77208ecf379fc439c87d6fc5b.

DVR has dependency on the portbinding host to determine
where to start the FloatingIP Namespace when floatingip
is configured. But when we assign a floatingip to a port
that is not bound, even though the API will succeed, the
FloatingIP Namespace will not be created by the Agent and
so the FloatingIP will not be functional.

This patch addresses the issue by creating the Namespace
and configuring the rules when the late binding happens.

The agent will be requesting the FIP agent gateway port,
if required and then proceed to configure the FloatingIP
Namespace.

When utilizing the dynamic inventory module and accompanying roles this can be supplied in one of three ways, all of which ultimately translate to JSON data that Ansible parses. The original method is to utilize a CSV file. It's format is below covered in the `Legacy CSV File Format` section. This has a number of limitations, but does allow a user to bulk load hardware from an inventory list with minimal data transformations. The newer method is to utilize a JSON or YAML document which the inventory parser will convert and provide to Ansible. In order to use, you will need to define the environment variable `BIFROST_INVENTORY_SOURCE` to equal a file, which then allows you to execute Ansible utilizing the bifrost_inventory.py file as the data source. Conversion from CSV to JSON formats ----------------------------------- The inventory/bifrost_inventory.py program additionally features a mode that allows a user to convert a CSV file to the JSON data format utilizing a `--convertcsv` flat when directly invoked. Example:: export BIFROST_INVENTORY_SOURCE=/tmp/baremetal.csv inventory/birost_inventory.py --convertcsv >/tmp/baremetal.json JSON file format ---------------- The JSON format closely resembles the data structure that Ironic utilizes internally. The name, driver_info, nics, driver, and properties fields are directly mapped through to Ironic. This means that the data contained with-in can vary from host to host, such as drivers and their parameters thus allowing a mixed hardware environment to be defined in a single file. Example:: { ""testvm1"": { ""uuid"": ""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"", ""driver_info"": { ""power"": { ""ssh_port"": 22, ""ssh_username"": ""ironic"", ""ssh_virt_type"": ""virsh"", ""ssh_address"": ""192.168.122.1"", ""ssh_key_filename"": ""/home/ironic/.ssh/id_rsa"" } }, ""nics"": [ { ""mac"": ""52:54:00:f9:32:f6"" } ], ""driver"": ""agent_ssh"", ""ansible_ssh_host"": ""192.168.122.2"", ""ipv4_address"": ""192.168.122.2"", ""properties"": { ""cpu_arch"": ""x86_64"", ""ram"": ""3072"", ""disk_size"": ""10"", ""cpus"": ""1"" }, ""name"": ""testvm1"" } } The additional power of this format is easy configuration parameter injection, which could potentially allow a user to provision different Operating System images on to different hardware chassis by defining the appropriate settings in an ""instance_info"" variable.

Introduction of the hp_xp driver broke cinder.conf.sample
generation due to the way the driver was registering the
configuration items.  Originally the options were being
included into the FC driver file and registered there.  When
the config generator found the options in the separate
hp_xp_opts.py file it did not know what group to include the
options in since they were not registered at all.

This fix moves registration of the options to the
hp_xp_opts.py file so that the cofig generation will work.
Since cfg.CONF is a global, the hp_xp driver will still have
access to the options in there after they are set by importing the opts file.
An additional problem that was uncovered when creating this
fix is the fact that the old config generator we are using from
oslo-incubator doesn't support using cfg.Opt.  To temporarily work
around this I have changed the cfg.Opts to be cfg.IntOpts or cfg.ListOpts
(as appropriate) and documented the valid values for those
options.

The last change that was necessary was to add config values for
several of the options in cinder/tests.py as the options were
marked as required by the driver.  If values were not set this
caused oslo config to error out reporting that they values needed
to be set.

Updated _make_subnet_request to generate only arguments for factory.
Moved preparing subnet request argument into ipam_backend_mixin,
since common for both backends.
Calling subnet request factory is backend specific so handled separately
and will be additionally updated in future patches:
For non-pluggable backend SubnetRequestFactory is used directly.
For pluggable backend SubnetRequestFactory will be obtained from ipam
driver instance (Pool) to allow override on driver level.

method. These changes remove the pool and the redundant switch call.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================= New way to get a project scoped token by name after Reseller ================= `bp reseller <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/reseller>`_ With the implementation of Reseller, domain is now considered a feature of project, i.e. a project with is_domain feature enabled is a single entity that behaves as a domain and a project. With this feature, it will be possible to have two projects with the same name inside a domain, one with the is_domain feature enabled and one without it. We need to figure a way to identify these projects and get a proper project scoped token by name, when this conflict happens. Problem Description =================== In Reseller, we have the domains concept merged into projects, that means that projects now behave as domains. Therefore, it is possible to have two projects with the same name in a hierarchy, one being a domain and another being a regular project. For instance, the following hierarchy will be valid, inside domain A:: A - project<is_domain=True> | B - project<is_domain=False> | A - project<is_domain=False> That hierarchy faces a problem when a user requests a project scoped token by name, once she’ll pass in the token body:: ""scope"": { ""project"": { ""domain"": { ""name"": ""A"" # Can also pass the id }, ""name"": ""A"" } } Currently, we have no way to distinguish which project she is referring to. Proposed Change =============== Specify the is_domain flag in the token request scope field. Getting a token to is_domain project A will be made through the following body:: ""project"": { ""domain"": { ""name"": ""A"" }, ""name"": ""A"", ""is_domain"": True } If the user does not provide the is_domain field or pass it as False, the token will be scoped to is_domain=False project A. Alternatives ------------ Do not allow a user to get a project scoped token to an is_domain project.

Nodes are automatically sorted by their id attribute that is useless for the end user. It is rather poor UI for managing large environments. There are many use cases that are desirable to maintain in the Fuel UI. For example, an ability to filter/sort nodes by their status or online state would save some time finding faulty/offline nodes in the list and performing bulk actions (like Delete) on them. Proposed change =============== We should introduce a form-based panel on node list screens in UI with filtering and sorting controls. If there is a limited number of node attribute values then the control should be a dropdown with multiple choice support. In other case it should be a single text field. User selection for filters and sorters is not stored neither on the backend, not in browser cookies. But the selection is automatically translated to a query and added to the page location string: .. code-block:: text #cluster/x/nodes/status:error;online:true;role:controller User is able to use such urls to filter and sort node list. Also node managegent panel should include Reset Filters button in order to help user immediately reset his selection to defaults and not to change each filtering control. Here a list of existing node attributes that should be used for sorting and filtering: +------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | Node attribute | Sorters | Filter | Filter | | | | (dropdown) | (text field) | +==================+===============+===============+===============+ | Name | + | | + | +------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | Manufacturer | + | + | | +------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | Public IP | + | | + | +------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | Management IP | + | | + | +------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | MAC address | + | | + | +------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | HDD size | + | + | | +------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | CPU | + | + | | +------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | RAM | + | + | | +------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | Interfaces speed | + | + | | +------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | Status | + | + | | +------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | Online | + | + | | +------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | Assigned roles | + | + | | +------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ Please note that the changes above should not affect DB and backend code. Alternatives ------------ The alternative here can be query-based language that could replace all the filtering and sorting controls. It is something like: .. code-block:: text status = error AND role in (controller, compute) and online = true ORDER BY name ASC, role DESC This method is rather flexible and requires no support when adding new node properties. But it is suitable for advanced user and we must first think of the newbies. So, as a first iteration of node management optimization it is suggested to introduce a form-based filter panel in the Fuel UI. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. This is just the UI/UX feature which doesn't affect backend somehow. Upgrade impact -------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Plugin impact ------------- None. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- None. Infrastructure impact --------------------- None.

Testing ======= This new Fuel UI feature should be covered by UI functional tests.

Some clouds out there are still running nova-network but we want to
provide support for neutron specific features and concepts like ports,
networks, subnets, etc.

This change is part of a set that adds neutron support to existing
floating IP-related functions, hiding that behind resource-oriented
methods.
For instance, at high level, end-users can now request that a public IP
is assigned to an instance without worrying about the specific service,
procedures and protocols used to provide that feature in the target
cloud.

Problem description =================== Functional tests for the front-end layer of Fuel are currently created with CasperJS framework, while tests are run against headless browser phantomjs as a part of CI procedure. Developer that works on bug fix or creates a new feature supposed to cover them with both unit and functional tests to avoid regression. The way functional tests are created and maintained currently is complex since CasperJS is not that flexible with the single-page web applications as InternJS. In addition there is no way to run tests against browsers with UI for debugging purposes. Proposed change =============== Adopt InternJS as the primary testing framework for UI functional tests. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ As soon Intern-based tests are run against Firefox browser it will take additional time for CI to validate patchsets committed. Plugin impact ------------- None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- Front-end developers have to cover features and fixes they work on with functional tests. These efforts should be taken into account while planning. Infrastructure impact --------------------- CI workers should be able to run Firefox browser in order to execute functional tests against it. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: * Nikolay Bogdanov (nbogdanov@mirantis.com) Other contributors: * Vitaly Kramskikh (vkramskikh@mirantis.com) Work Items ---------- * Research the way how Intern tests should be created and organized * Create initial helper library to cover the most frequent tasks (log in, skip welcome page, create cluster, remove cluster) * Create several tests as an example Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= None Acceptance criteria ------------------- * Functional tests for the UI are the part of the CI process and are executed on every commit. Execution result affects build status * Helper library (page) that covers below use-cases is created: * Log In * Log Out * Skip Welcome page * Create Cluster * Remove Cluster * Add Cluster nodes * The following pages (partially) covered with functional tests: * Log In * Welcome page * Clusters page * Cluster page Documentation Impact ==================== None References ========== * InternJS library - https://theintern.github.io * ChaiJS assertion library - http://chaijs.com * Leadfoot library for consistency with Selenium WebDriver API - https://theintern.github.io/leadfoot ",,160,0

Problem description =================== The name that is visible in the UI/CLI/API for the node is NOT what is applied as the hostname when the node is deployed. The hostname is dynamically generated (i.e. node-1, node-2 .. node-x). The naming convention that is captured in the Fuel DB should be applied as the hostname during the provisioning process to enable customers to access the device for updates, security checks, etc. and prevent confusion. Proposed change =============== This spec proposes to extend fuel-cli and nailgun validation API as well in order to use custom names for generating the hostname prior provisioning stage. * Employ visible node name as a target node hostname * Extend nailgun node validation API * Modify `nailgun/objects/node.py:make_slave_name()` to use instance name * Extend fuel-cli to support node re-naming for example:: fuel node --node-id 15 --setname node-3 Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- NodeValidator should be extended to handle incorrect node's hostname format and duplicates of hostnames within a cluster as well. Upgrade impact -------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- End user gets ``--setname`` additional option via CLI, that not required for changes. Deployed env can work properly with default values. Performance Impact ------------------ None Plugin impact ------------- None Other deployer impact --------------------- Will allow to map node name to hostname of a physical node. Developer impact ---------------- None Infrastructure impact --------------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: <None> Other contributors: <None> Work Items ---------- * Forbid to rename node after provisioning * Extend fuel-cli to use ``--setname`` option * Modify NodeValidation API of Nailgun * Modify `nailgun/objects/node.py:make_slave_name()` to use instance name instead of node-{instance id} template for real target hostname. * Write a documentation Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= * Nailgun tests should be passed * Fuel-cli tests should be passed Documentation Impact ==================== * A note should be added to Fuel Deployment Guide to describe the possibility to specify custom node hostname. * The documentation should warn about using default node-{id} template for hostname which will be used in case of incorrect name format.

Problem description =================== Currently Fuel UI is covered only by functional tests based on CasperJS functional testing framework. It allows end-to-end testing of Fuel UI, but there are lots of cases which can't be covered (or covered with lots of efforts) by functional testing. So we need also to be able to write and run unit tests for Fuel UI. Proposed change =============== We should implement unit test runner for Fuel UI using Intern Framework: * It should be available by running ``./run_tests.sh --ui-unit``. * It should be voting. * At least one test suite should be added (for Expression parser). Alternatives ------------ There are quite a few JS unit test frameworks available, but we should go with Intern as it also support functional testing and we plan to switch to it someday. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Upgrade impact -------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Plugin impact ------------- None. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- If suitable, new changes to Fuel UI should be covered by unit tests. Infrastructure impact --------------------- Intern uses Selenium, so Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6 or newer version should be installed on Fuel CI workers. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: * Vitaly Kramskikh <vkramskikh@mirantis.com> Other contributors: * Przemyslaw Kaminski <pkaminski@mirantis.com> Mandatory design review: * Vitaly Kramskikh <vkramskikh@mirantis.com> QA engineer: * Anastasia Palkina <apalkina@mirantis.com> Work Items ---------- TBD. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= None. Acceptance criteria ------------------- TBD. Documentation Impact ==================== * Development environment setup docs should be modified to mention dependency on JRE for UI unit testing. * There should be described how to run unit tests on development environments.

Upstream # has a way of doing things and it works fine. It follows all of PBR's # conventions, and all is well and good. You can stop reading, now. # If you're doing downstream development, you may have processes which don't # follow PBR's conventions. In particular, it's reasonably likely that your # version numbers won't correspond to PBR's vision of the ONE TRUE WAY. You will # probably be seeing an unfathomable error along the lines of: # ValueError: git history requires a target version of pbr.version.SemanticVersion(2014.1.5), but target version is pbr.version.SemanticVersion(2014.1.4) # error in setup command: Error parsing /home/mbooth/src/openstack/nova/setup.cfg: ValueError: git history requires a target version of pbr.version.SemanticVersion(2014.1.5), but target version is pbr.version.SemanticVersion(2014.1.4) # You may wonder why, when you have gone to the effort of specifying a version # number explicitly in your config, it has the gall to tell you it's # unacceptable. You may just want it to go away. # This tool outputs a static setup.py which can be used to replace the default # setup.py. The static setup.py still uses a couple of pbr components, but not # the whole thing.

To resolve these failures, review these logs: - cinder-api log (``/var/log/cinder/api.log``) - cinder-volume log (``/var/log/cinder/volume.log``) The cinder-api log is useful for determining if you have endpoint or connectivity issues. If you send a request to create a volume and it fails, review the cinder-api log to determine whether the request made it to the Block Storage service. If the request is logged and you see no errors or trace-backs, check the cinder-volume log for errors or trace-backs. .. note:: Create commands are listed in the cinder-api log. These entries in the ``cinder.openstack.common.log`` file can be used to assist in troubleshooting your block storage configuration. .. code:: ini # Print debugging output (set logging level to DEBUG instead # of default WARNING level).

To correct, use these suggested solutions. - Issues with ``state_path`` and ``volumes_dir`` settings. The OpenStack Block Storage uses ``tgtd`` as the default iSCSI helper and implements persistent targets. This means that in the case of a tgt restart or even a node reboot your existing volumes on that node will be restored automatically with their original IQN. In order to make this possible the iSCSI target information needs to be stored in a file on creation that can be queried in case of restart of the tgt daemon. By default, Block Storage uses a ``state_path`` variable, which if installing with Yum or APT should be set to ``/var/lib/cinder/``. The next part is the ``volumes_dir`` variable, by default this just simply appends a ""``volumes``\ "" directory to the ``state_path``. The result is a file-tree ``/var/lib/cinder/volumes/``. While the installer should handle all this, it can go wrong. If you have trouble creating volumes and this directory does not exist you should see an error message in the cinder-volume log indicating that the ``volumes_dir`` does not exist, and it should provide information about which path it was looking for. - The persistent tgt include file. Along with the ``volumes_dir`` option, the iSCSI target driver also needs to be configured to look in the correct place for the persist files. This is a simple entry in the ``/etc/tgt/conf.d`` file that you should have set when you installed OpenStack. If issues occur, verify that you have a ``/etc/tgt/conf.d/cinder.conf`` file. If the file is not present, create it with this command: :: # echo 'include /var/lib/cinder/volumes/ *' >> /etc/tgt/conf.d/cinder.conf - No sign of attach call in the cinder-api log. This is most likely going to be a minor adjustment to your ``nova.conf`` file. Make sure that your ``nova.conf`` has this entry: :: volume\_api\_class=nova.volume.cinder.API</programlisting> - Failed to create iscsi target error in the ``cinder-volume.log`` file. .. code:: bash 2013-03-12 01:35:43 1248 TRACE cinder.openstack.common.rpc.amqp ISCSITargetCreateFailed: Failed to create iscsi target for volume volume-137641b2-af72-4a2f-b243-65fdccd38780. You might see this error in ``cinder-volume.log`` after trying to create a volume that is 1 GB. To fix this issue: Change content of the ``/etc/tgt/targets.conf`` from ``include /etc/tgt/conf.d/*.conf`` to ``include/etc/tgt/conf.d/cinder_tgt.conf``, as follows: .. code:: bash include /etc/tgt/conf.d/cinder_tgt.conf include /etc/tgt/conf.d/cinder.conf default-driver iscsi Restart tgt and cinder-\* services so they pick up the new configuration.",,170,0

There are cases where we want to catch and retry some additional
exceptions and treat them as RetryRequests depending on method
that is being excecuted (e.g. StaleDataError or ObjectDeletedError).

This patch changes the wrap_db_retry decorator to take an extra
parameter that is a list of additional exception classes that will
be caught and treated as a RetryRequest.

By default priorities are
1) upstream 90
2) proprietary 20

We need to be able to download packages from
various repositories taking into account repository
priority. We need this for patching story.

By default priorities are
1) upstream 90
2) proprietary 20
3) DENY_RPM_DOWNGRADE=1 (default: 1), we are
   not allowed to downgrade rpm packages. In some
   cases when we need to be able to use downgraded
   versions this flag should be set to 0:
      DENY_RPM_DOWNGRADE=0

EXTRA_RPM_REPOS is to have the following format
    ""name1,url1,pri1 name2,url2,pri2""

In case when pri is not defined it will be set to 10,
for example:
    ""name1,url1"" is equal to ""name1,url1,10""

* NodeStatusError exception should be considered as an internal error,
catch it and send an event report.
* Currently when stack creation failed, node creation does not go to an error

Tempest upgrade may trigger miscelaneous python library updates. (This
is because installing latest openstackclient is part of the process.)

We should avoid updating runtime python libraries while other API
services are running, especially those that use WSGI to serve requests,
since those may potentially reload the whole python stack on each new
request, meaning they may hit inconsistent python site-packages state.

To achieve this, install openstackclient before service upgrades, making
sure that later, upgrade-tempest does not really update python packages
for us.

The bug currently shows up as keystone import failures that result in
glance request failure due to 500 returned from keystone, but is
applicable for every service that rely on keystone WSGI service.

gnocchi packaging is not yet ready, thus we cant do functional testing
on this module, but beaker jobs are now voting in the OpenStack CI this
therefore blocks all patches on puppet-gnocchi module.

This patch add a noop acceptance test in order to unlock the CI for
puppet-gnocchi.

 lint: Fix lint issues (missing documentation for define types)
 The gem 'puppet-lint-param-docs' was bumped to 1.2.0 and now handle

The current puppetlabs/concat and puppetlabs/apache dependencies

Change to a more flexible dependency model to ensure dependencies

Drop firefly from the ::ceph::rgw::apache tests as it seems buggy.

Adds initial grenade integration for Heat. This patch now uses
the new modular resource checks that were implemented recently
in grenade.

For now, we create a simple OS::Heat::RandomString resource
and check whether the stack survives the upgrade.

We should add better tests for upgrades in the future.

to use two database fields for storing raid_config and
target_raid_config and adds REST APIs to read/write values
into the fields.

These can then be brought together using template resources. This is a mechanism to define a resource using a template, thus composing one logical stack with multiple templates. Template resources provide a feature similar to the :hotref:`AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` resource, but also provide a way to: * Define new resource types and build your own resource library. * Override the default behaviour of existing resource types. To achieve this: * The Orchestration client gets the associated template files and passes them along in the ``files`` section of the ``POST stacks/`` API request. * The environment in the Orchestration engine manages the mapping of resource type to template creation. * The Orchestration engine translates template parameters into resource properties. The following examples illustrate how you can use a custom template to define new types of resources. These examples use a custom template stored in a :file:`my_nova.yml` file: .. code-block:: yaml :linenos: heat_template_version: 2014-10-16 parameters: key_name: type: string description: Name of a KeyPair resources: server: type: OS::Nova::Server properties: key_name: {get_param: key_name} flavor: m1.small image: ubuntu-trusty-x86_64 Use the template filename as type ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The following template defines the :file:`my_nova.yaml` file as value for the ``type`` property of a resource: .. code-block:: yaml :linenos: heat_template_version: 2014-10-16 resources: my_server: type: my_nova.yaml properties: key_name: my_key The :code:`key_name` argument of the ``my_nova.yaml`` template gets its value from the :code:`key_name` property of the new template. .. note:: The above reference to ``my_nova.yaml`` assumes it is in the same directory. You can use any of the following forms: * Relative path (:file:`my_nova.yaml`) * Absolute path (:file:`file:///home/user/templates/my_nova.yaml`) * Http URL (:file:`http://example.com/templates/my_nova.yaml`) * Https URL (:file:`https://example.com/templates/my_nova.yaml`) To create the stack run: .. code-block:: console $ heat stack-create -f main.yaml stack1 Define a new resource type ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ You can associate a name to the :file:`my_nova.yaml` template in an environment file. If the name is already known by the Orchestration module then your new resource will override the default one. In the following example a new ``OS::Nova::Server`` resource overrides the default resource of the same name. An :file:`env.yaml` environment file holds the definition of the new resource: .. code-block:: yaml resource_registry: ""OS::Nova::Server"": my_nova.yaml .. note:: See :ref:`environments` for more detail about environment files. You can now use the new ``OS::Nova::Server`` in your new template: .. code-block:: yaml :linenos: heat_template_version: 2014-10-16 resources: my_server: type: OS::Nova::Server properties: key_name: my_key To create the stack run: .. code-block:: console $ heat stack-create -f main.yaml -e env.yaml example-two Get access to nested attributes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ There are implicit attributes of a template resource.

Currently neutron client is written to auto generate
methods on fly. This is very difficult to debug and
make code very difficult to read.

As neutron client will be moved to lib, it will be better to
have its interfaces more readable and consistent with other
service clients.

This commit re-factor it for 'create_*' methods.

There is no reason to reclaim the local VLAN on a network_delete
event since it will be reclaimed when the last port is deleted anyway.

This method was racey with recent port creation events and lead to
occasional traces when it would yank the local VLAN out from underneath
an ongoing port wiring process.

In Nova flavors it is ok to specify a decimal RXTX factor.
For this reason when applying QoS to a port Neutron should not
convert this factor to an integer value, but simply ensure
it's a valid float number and positive.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Neutron ML2 Reference Implementation Split ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/reference-implementation-split This spec tracks the splitting out of the ML2+[OVS,LB], L3 and DHCP reference implementations from the main neutron source tree into a separate git repository under the neutron project. This is being done to ensure the focus of Neutron is squarely on being a DB/API layer, and to ensure the existing RPC and agent-based SDN reference implementation can evolve on it's own. This also puts the existing reference implementation on equal footing with the other Open Source implementations. As Neutron is a platform, competing with those technologies it wants to enable has always seemed strange. Problem Description =================== Neutron has grown large. It also has developed an in-tree reference implementation. Some of the problems with this model are: * The in-tree reference implementation was meant as a proof of concept but instead was confused as being deployable. We've worked for 3 cycles now to fix this. * The skills necessary to develop an SDN controller (what the in-tree reference implementation is) are different from those necessary to build a scalable API server. This has resulted in core reviewers who focus on one area or the other. * By having an in-tree reference implementation which is open source, we are competing with other open source as well as vendor implementations. This goes against a core tenant of Neutron, which is to be a scalable networking API, not an SDN controller. By factoring out the reference implementation, we will put Neutron back on firm ground as an API server with a DB layer. We will no longer be directly competing with the implementations who chose to implement the Neutron API. And we will allow a natural split of core reviewers across the two projects. Proposed Change =============== We will create a new git repository for neutron called ""neutron-reference."" The following directories will be migrated out and into this directory: * neutron/agent * neutron/plugins/linuxbridge * neutron/plugins/ml2 * neutron/plugins/openvswitch * neutron/tests/functional/agent This move will result in the SDN agent-based implementation existing in the new repository. As such, changes to devstack will be required to install the agent-based implementation from the new repository. Not we will be moving the functional tests around the agent into the new repository. For now, we'll leave the Tempest tests for Neutron in-tree, as they do not require a specific backend implementation. The goal is to enhance those long-term so they can become a sort of qualification test for backend implementations. Data Model Impact ----------------- The new repository will rely on neutron for it's DB initially. REST API Impact --------------- None Security Impact --------------- None Notifications Impact -------------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- End users will now have to install the reference implementation from a separate git repository. Thus, packagers will need to package a new git repository as well. Performance Impact ------------------ None IPv6 Impact ----------- None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- Deployers will need to be made aware of the fact they will need to deploy from a separate git repository if they are using the existing in-tree implementation. Developer Impact ---------------- By splitting out the reference implementation, we will be increasing developer velocity by having a smaller core team focused on this bit of code. Community Impact ---------------- This will be inflating Neutron's Big Tent a big more, but adding another git repository. I expect it to increase the community, as we grow and add more developers looking to develop SDN controllers. If you use the broader Big Tent analogy [1]_ as an example, we will be broadening Neutron's tent while at the same time focusing the core of Neutron. Alternatives ------------ There are no alternatives other than keeping the in-tree reference implementation as it is. But given the issues with this, moving it out is the only realistic way forward. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Kyle Mestery: https://launchpad.net/~mestery Other contributors: Doug Wiegley: https://launchpad.net/~dougwig Work Items ---------- * Create the new git repository with the existing history of the directories proposed above. * Ensure basic UT works, including pep8. * Ensure devstack is updated to install the code from the new repository. * Ensure all gate jobs work as expected. * Profit. Dependencies ============ There may be a dependency on the neutron-lib work [2]_ being done. The new code will be a user of some neutron features, much like the advanced services. We'll know more about this being a hard dependency soon. Testing ======= Testing is critical for this to be a success. Given we'll be moving the code which runs for all neutron jobs, among others, it's critical we ensure a smooth experience. The gate will likely be affected during the transition window, but the goal will be to get things moving as quickly as we can. Tempest Tests ------------- The goal is keep all existing Tempest tests running. Functional Tests ---------------- The goal is keep all existing Functional tests running. The new repository will add new functional test as needed. API Tests --------- None Documentation Impact ==================== This will require documentation changes, as the documentation changes assumes the reference implementation. We will not change that aspect of the documentation, only where to install the reference implementation from. User Documentation ------------------ See above. Developer Documentation ----------------------- None References ========== .. [1] http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/openstack-as-layers-but-also-a-big-tent-but-also-a-bunch-of-cats ..

This patch will use the Depends-On info stored in the ZUUL_CHANGES
env var to update the Berksfile to a local patch and then use
zuul-cloner to pull down that dependency.

To use Depends-On, add the following to your commit message AFTER
the description and BEFORE the change id and bug/blueprint ref.
""Depends-On: <id>""
The id is the change id of the gerrit patch this patch depends on.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =========================================== Add simpler Nova-Neutron port binding types =========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/nova-neutron-binding-negotiation This proposes adding a set of binding types that have simple code on Nova's side, with all the complexity in Neutron, and making them preferentially selected via the binding negotiation.. Problem description =================== The binding types are frequently quite complex in the operations they require of Nova. Specifically: - Nova phsyically predicts the naming conventions of TAP interfaces - Nova knows what the integration bridge is called, via config - Some binding types require onerous setup on Nova's part This actually prevents the development of new network controllers and techiques because the binding type can be very specific to the controller it was originally intended for, and adding binding types to Nova is done defensively. It makes Nova's responsibility for binding excessively complex when in fact most of the networking work could be the responsibility of Neutron (which does really quite a lot of networking already). Use Cases ---------- When developing a new driver, more basic binding types are more widely applicable. When using old drivers, they are actually usable with existing Neutron network control code with minor changes on Neutron's side. The binding negotiation patch means that they can be used if and only if both sides support them. Project Priority ----------------- None. Proposed change =============== This proposes adding simplified drivers to Nova with a subsequent change to Neutron to make use of them if they are in the preference list. Simplified adds up to the following: - information on the naming of elements that Nova must make use of will be returned from Neutron, and not calculated in lockstep in Nova code. - Where an existing binding can have work moved to Neutron, a simpler binding with that work absent will be added. We propose doing this initially in the libvirt driver for KVM use cases. Alternatives ------------ Do nothing. Live with complex VIF plugging code forever. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- The syntax of the API does not change but Nova will pass a different preference list when calling Neutron. Security impact --------------- Neutron may return inauspicious values for files and network interfaces. Nova should validate that all files are in a directory it considers safe (which will, unfortunately, need to be configured to match in Nova and Neutron). Nova should also ensure that interface names either match a regex (e.g. 'nt-.*') or are specifically identical to the configured interface name in the Nova config file (e.g. ovs_bridge). Since the API is internal this is a minor security concern but validating the inputs ensures that the interface will not cause Nova to do unfortunate things in the case that Neutron screws up. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- When adding VIF drivers developers should avoid putting any code in Nova beyond the code necessary to bind the interface. Calculation should not be used for values that Neutron could pass. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ijw-ubuntu Other contributors: sc68cal Work Items ---------- Dependencies ============ We do not depend on, but must be wary of, the currently active refactoring of the Nova code for Neutron binding. Testing ======= Confirm that Nova accepts and reacts correctly to the new and the old binding types in the lists that now contain both. Confirm that Nova refuses a new binding type when it is not offered. Documentation Impact ==================== The new binding types should be documented. References ========== None.

Due to issues caused by dnsmasq restarts sending DHCPNAKs,
change Ieff0236670c1403b5d79ad8e50d7574c1b694e34 passed the
'dhcp-authoritative' option to dnsmasq. While this solved the
restart issue, it broke the multi-DHCP server scenario because
the dnsmasq instances will NAK requests to a server ID that
isn't their own.

Problem DHCP Request Lifecycle:

Client: DHCPDISCOVER(broadcast)
Server1: DHCPOFFER
Server2: DHCPOFFER
Client: DHCPREQUEST(broadcast with Server-ID=Server1)
Server1: DHCPACK
Server2: DHCPNAK(in response to observed DHCPREQUEST with other Server-ID)
          ^---Causes issues

This change removes the authoritative option so NAKs are not
send in response to DHCPREQUEST's to other servers. To handle
the original issue that Ieff0236670c1403b5d79ad8e50d7574c1b694e34
was inteded to address, this patch also allows changes to be persisted
to a local lease file.

In order to handle the issue where a DHCP server may be scheduled
to another agent, a fake lease file is generated for dnsmasq to start
with. The contents are populated based on all of the known ports for
a network. This should prevent dnsmasq from NAKing clients renewing
leases issued before it was restarted/rescheduled.

The default policy for server_list API in nova has changed. This
exposed a problem in the way Horizon was calling server_list when
reading quota values. The call was always made with
all_tenants=True, which is only something admin should be able to
do. Instead of ignoring the privilege problem in the API as in the
past, there is a pre-emptive policy check that makes the call fail.

The fix in Horizon is to only pass in all_tenants=True when the
user has the appropriate privilege level. nova_policy.json has been
updated with the appropriate default and the permission check has
been added.

Removing passing in all_tenants=True at all was contemplated, but
when setting quota values on projects in the identity dashboard,
the administrator level user needs to read quota values from a
project that they are not currently scoped to.

This fixes the error on the network topology screen that was the
motivation for the original bug report.

Restructure the command-line parsing to use the flag library.

I expect there will be more work in this area, but for now this allows us to
propogate flags like --once down to where the daemons actually run.

The daemons can be ran in the foreground with ""hummingbird object"",
""hummingbird object-replicator"", etc.  All daemons accept the flags -c [config],
to specify the config file and -d, which tells it to close stdout after
starting.

So ""hummingbird start object"" now runs ""hummingbird object -d -c [config]"" in
the background.

This change also much improves the output of ""hummingbird -h""

The Oslo libraries have moved all of their code out of the 'oslo'
namespace package into per-library packages. The namespace package was
retained during kilo for backwards compatibility, but will be removed by
the liberty-2 milestone. This change removes the use of the namespace
package, replacing it with the new package names.

The patches in the libraries will be put on hold until application
patches have landed, or L2, whichever comes first. At that point, new
versions of the libraries without namespace packages will be released as
a major version update.

Please merge this patch, or an equivalent, before L2 to avoid problems

Problem description =================== Current PCI passthrough whitelist address entry is defined as: [""address"": ""[[[[<domain>]:]<bus>]:][<slot>][.[<function>]]"" where the address uses the same syntax as it's in lspci or aggregated declaration of PCI devices by using '*'. Therefore there is no way to exclude specific VF(s) from the PCI passthrough whitelist address. Use Cases ---------- Deployer may want to exclude specific VF(s) to be used for other purposes. For instance VF can be used to connect compute node to storage node by running iSER (iSCSI Extensions for RDMA) transport. Project Priority ----------------- None Proposed change =============== Enhance PCI passthrough whitelist to support range on all address attributes. Example for the range syntax. pci_passthrough_whitelist={""address"":""\*:02:00.2-"",""physical_network"":""net1""} This allows allocation of VFs whose functions are from 2 upwards. pci_passthrough_whitelist={""address"":""\*:02:00.-2"",""physical_network"":""net1""} This allows allocation of VFs whose functions are from 2 downwards. pci_passthrough_whitelist={""address"":""\*:02:1-2.\*"",""physical_network"":""net1""} This allows allocation of VFs whose slots are between 1 and 2.

This is a follow on to change I8cf5483982085da57ee470fa2753b0d0aebc12b3.

In the case of a race to deallocate an instance which was previously
associated with a fixed IP that is now currently associated with a new
instance (with different VIFs and therefore different MAC addresses), we
check the mac address in release_fixed_ip to see if it's on the VIF that
is related to the instance that is associated to the fixed IP being
released.

If the currently associated instance on the fixed IP does not match the
instance associated with the old VIF (from the mac address passed in),
ignore the release request so we don't diassociate the fixed IP from the
new instance that is allocating network with that fixed IP.

Also fixes the method so that it doesn't attempt to update the fixed IP
in the database if it's not leased.

There were no existing unit tests for released_fixed_ip so a whole set
of new tests is added to cover the various conditions in the method.

This patch:
- adds a translated orchestration_stack-domain-users.rst to the
  openstack-manuals/doc/admin-guide-cloud-rst/source;
- removes a duplicated sentence in the Stack domain users
  configuration section (The domain ID is returned by this command,
  and is referred to as $HEAT_DOMAIN_ID below.)

For example, allow AutoScaling actions to be performed in response to some measure of performance or quality of service. Orchestration provides APIs which enable all of these things, but all of those APIs require some sort of authentication. For example, credentials to access the instance agent is running on. The heat-cfntools agents use signed requests, which requires an ec2 keypair created via OpenStack Identity, which is then used to sign requests to the Orchestration CloudFormation and CloudWatch compatible APIs, which are authenticated by Orchestration via signature validation (which uses the OpenStack Identity ec2tokens extension). Stack domain users allow to encapuslate all stack-defined users (users created as a result of things contained in an Orchestration template) in a separate domain which is created specifically to contain things related only to the Orchestration stacks. A user is created which is the *domain admin*, and Orchestration uses that user to manage the lifecycle of the users in the stack *user domain*. Stack domain users configuration -------------------------------- To configure stack domain users the following steps shall be executed: #. A special OpenStack Identity service domain is created. For example, the one called ``heat`` and the ID is set in the ``stack_user_domain`` option in :file:`heat.conf`. #. A user with sufficient permissions to create and delete projects and users in the ``heat`` domain is created. #. The username and password for the domain admin user is set in :file:`heat.conf` (``stack_domain_admin`` and ``stack_domain_admin_password``). This user administers *stack domain users* on behalf of stack owners, so they no longer need to be admins themselves, and the risk of this escalation path is limited because the ``heat_domain_admin`` is only given administrative permission for the ``heat`` domain. You must complete the following steps to setup stack domain users: #. Create the domain: ``$OS_TOKEN`` refers to a token. For example, the service admin token or some other valid token for a user with sufficient roles to create users and domains. ``$KS_ENDPOINT_V3`` refers to the v3 OpenStack Identity endpoint (for example, ``http://keystone_address:5000/v3`` where *keystone_address* is the IP address or resolvable name for the OpenStack Identity service). :: $ openstack --os-token $OS_TOKEN --os-url=$KS_ENDPOINT_V3 --os-\ identity-api-version=3 domain create heat --description ""Owns \ users and projects created by heat"" The domain ID is returned by this command, and is referred to as ``$HEAT_DOMAIN_ID`` below. #. Create the user:: $ openstack --os-token $OS_TOKEN --os-url=$KS_ENDPOINT_V3 --os-\ identity-api-version=3 user create --password $PASSWORD --domain \ $HEAT_DOMAIN_ID heat_domain_admin --description ""Manages users \ and projects created by heat"" The user ID is returned by this command and is referred to as ``$DOMAIN_ADMIN_ID`` below. #. Make the user a domain admin:: $ openstack --os-token $OS_TOKEN --os-url=$KS_ENDPOINT_V3 --os-\ identity-api-version=3 role add --user $DOMAIN_ADMIN_ID --domain \ $HEAT_DOMAIN_ID admin Then you need to add the domain ID, username and password from these steps to :file:`heat.conf`: .. code-block:: ini :linenos: stack_domain_admin_password = password stack_domain_admin = heat_domain_admin stack_user_domain = domain id returned from domain create above Usage workflow -------------- The following steps will be executed during stack creation: #. Orchestration creates a new *stack domain project* in the ``heat`` domain if the stack contains any resources which require creation of a *stack domain user*. #. For any resources which require a user, Orchestration creates the user in the *stack domain project*, which is associated with the Orchestration stack in the Orchestration database, but is completely separate and unrelated (from an authentication perspective) to the stack owners project (the users created in the stack domain are still assigned the ``heat_stack_user`` role, so the API surface they can access is limited via :file:`policy.json`. See :ref:`OpenStack Identity documentation <identity_management>` for more info). #. When API requests are processed, Orchestration does an internal lookup and allows stack details for a given stack to be retrieved from the database for both the stack owner's project (the default API path to the stack) and the stack domain project, subject to the :file:`policy.json` restrictions. To clarify that last point, that means there are now two paths which can result in retrieval of the same data via the Orchestration API. The example for resource-metadata is below:: GET v1/​{stack_owner_project_id}​/stacks/​{stack_name}​/\ ​{stack_id}​/resources/​{resource_name}​/metadata or:: GET v1/​{stack_domain_project_id}​/stacks/​{stack_name}​/​\ {stack_id}​/resources/​{resource_name}​/metadata The stack owner uses the former (via ``heat resource-metadata {stack_name} {resource_name}``), and any agents in the instance use the latter.
