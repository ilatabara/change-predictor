The API reference for deleting a server is making the assumption that
the instance is going to be (hard) deleted from the system, but it
doesn't take into account the case that CONF.reclaim_instance_interval
is set, which if > 0 makes the API 'soft delete' the instance, so that
the instance's vm won't be deleted until the
CONF.reclaim_instance_interval has expired since the instance was soft
deleted. The instance marked as ``SOFT_DELETED`` can be recovered via
``restore`` action before it's really deleted from the system. We should
update the reference to talk about the soft deleted wrinkle so we can set
expectations.

db.get_oldest_pending_db_row_with_lock() should return oldest entry
regarding to seqnum. not last_retried.
If last_retried is used, log entry is unnecessarily scanned when there
are dependencies. It's known that journal back log can be big like 1k
entries with tempest tests.
By using seqnum, it can be avoided because dependency is basically the
order of creation of journal entry.

example for details:
U0(processing), U1(pending), U2(pending), U3(pending) ...
-> time (seqnum or last_retried)
where U<N> is update on same resource like neutron network.

When U1 is picked and put back to pending due to U0 dependency,
last_retried is updated. If last_retried is used to pick oldest entry,
it means U1 is put back at the last of the list.
So U2, U3 ... need to be picked/put back without any progress, then
U1 can be processed after U0 is completed. This behavior also imposes
too long latency.
The drawback is potential live lock. e.g. U1 can be picked and put back
repeatedly until U0 is completed. This will be addressed by the
following patch.

from a host with interface mapping 'physnet1:eth1' to a host

the target on 'eth2' instead of 'eth1'. This fix detects

1.problem
Now there are no verifications about narrowing allocation pool of subnet,
so there are some vms which have the ips in a subnet,
the ip of vm belong to the allocation pool of the subnet.
when we narrowed the range of allocation pool to ignore the ips of vm,
Now the operation can succeed
2.solution
The ipaddress of vm in ipallocation must belong to a ipallocationpools
when narrowing the range of allocation pool
we get the ipallocation from db
verify the allocation poll with the vm ips
if not ,raise IPAllocationNotInAllocationPools

As per Barcelona summit fishbowl testing session, we're gonna introduce
a set of tests that cannot be run on the gate but still will be part of
the tree.

These tests will live in a specific directory. As these days we don't
run pylint on neutorn/tests directory this patch introduces a
whitelist of directories/files that will be specifically checked.
Skipped tests will be part of this whitelist.

This change adds the common code to handle new address-groups API:

* API extension
* Service plugin
* DB model
* DB migration
* OVO support
* Unittests

It also introduce an optional attribute for the security-group-rule, the
'remote-address-group', a uuid field to refer a specific address-group
object, to be used instead of the current 'remote-ip-prefix' that can
only denote one IP network.

Adding constraints support to libraries is slightly more complex than

This change adds constraints support by also adding a helper script to

We don't currently support SQLAlchemy 1.1.4, but in preparation of the
day we do we can start making simple changes that will facilitate the
transition.

In SQLAlchemy 1.1 the .autoincrement directive is no longer implicitly
enabled for a composite primary key column, so the id field in the
workers ORM class will no longer be set as autoincrement, which means
that when creating a worker we will not be updating the id field of the
instance and it will left as None in memory while it is properly set in
the DB.

This patch resolves this issue by defining the id field as an auto
increment field explicitly instead of relying on the implicit definition
exiting in SQLAlchemy 1.0.

In current code, we get the port's subnet by checking the
subnet's subnetpool_id equal with the given PoolID, but in
existing environment, the subnet may lack subnetpool_id,
hence we will not get the port's subnet and leaves the
kuryr-libnetwork port undeleted.

This patch checks the port's device owner and determines
the given POOL's subnet_id and ip_address is equal to
port's fixed_ips attribute.

Loading subnets as part of the networks list and networks
as part of the subnets list appears to have a significant
impact when the network has tags and the subnets have
extra routes entries. This is even further compounded by
the network having rbac entries (likely due to the subnet
inheriting the RBAC entries of the network with the custom
join condition in the model).

This patch converts rbac_entries on both subnet and network
to use a subquery and converts the network and subnets
relationships on the subnet and network models (respectively)
to use subqueries as well.

On my dev environment after running the script in the report,
a network list took 5 minutes. Converting just the rbac_entries
or just the network/subnet relationship to subqueries reduced it
to 3-5 seconds. Converting both (as this patch does), reduces it
back down to a couple of hundred milliseconds (normal perf of my
development env with the current network count).

Subqueries will just cost us a constant number of queries and
won't scale up with result count so this should not impact scalability
in any way.

None of these fields are queryable from the API, so we don't need
to worry about breaking queries against the models.

ensure that this is the value being used in the creation of the
transport_url. This change leverages the stdlib str2bool and bool2num to
ensure that when provided the ssl paramter ends up being 0/1 which is
the correct format for the transport url.  Additionally this also allows
for string booleans to be passed into the ssl parameter and it should
still work correctly.

Currently the Keystone leader charm creates new domains and stores
the UUIDs locally on disk. This approach predates charm relation-/
leader- storage, is error prone, and causes problems in HA setups.

Move to leader storage and remove old interfaces. There is no need
to migrate the on-disk stored data as it is read from the deployment
and stored as a part of the upgrade process.

Do not set default values for service_tenant_id, admin_domain_id and
default_domain_id. This will cause context to be incomplete on peer
units until the values are actually available.

Change functional tests to run on Keystone cluster to verify contents of
configuration and operation of services in clustered environment.

(also fixup stable amulet tests to use python from venv).

Adding constraints support to libraries is slightly more complex than
services as the libraries themselves are listed in upper-constraints.txt
which leads to errors that you can't install a specific version and a
constrained version.

This change adds constraints support by also adding a helper script to
edit the constraints to remove python-senlinclient.

Leverage the new cliff command class attribute (_description)
to get the help of a command, this allows us to mark strings
for translation[1]. We could not do this before since the help
was grabbed from the docstring.

from taskflow is overridden to suppress traceback for special

traceback in logs for these exceptions as _format_failure method

This patch fixes the object-reconstructor to calculate device_count
as the total number of local devices in all policies. Previously
Swift counts it for each policy but reconstruction_device_count
which means the number of devices actually swift needs to reconstruct
is counted as sum of ones for all polices.

With this patch, Swift will gather all local devices for all policies
at first, and then, collect parts for each devices as well as current.
To do so, we can see the statuses for remaining job/disks percentage via
stats_line output.

To enable this change, this patch also touchs the object replicator
to get a DiskFileManager via the DiskFileRouter class so that
DiskFileManager instances are policy specific. Currently the same
replication policy DiskFileManager class is always used, but this
change future proofs the replicator for possible other DiskFileManager
implementations.

The change also gives the ObjectReplicator a _df_router variable,
making it consistent with the ObjectReconstructor, and allowing a
common way for ssync.Sender to access DiskFileManager instances via
it's daemon's _df_router instance.

Also, remove the use of FakeReplicator from the ssync test suite. It
was not necessary and risked masking divergence between ssync and the
replicator and reconstructor daemon implementations.

This sets up the HTTPProxyToWSGI middleware in front of senlin-api. The
purpose of this middleware is to set up the request URL correctly in
the case there is a proxy (For instance, a loadbalancer such as HAProxy)
in front of senlin-api.

So, when TLS connections are terminated at the proxy, and one tries to
get the versions from the '/' resource from senlin-api, one will notice
that the protocol is incorrect; It will show 'http' instead of 'https'.
So this middleware handles such cases, thus helping Keystone discovery
work correctly.

The HTTPProxyToWSGI is off by default and needs to be enabled via a
configuration value.

Sync in the charm-helpers fix which configures the Apache2
openstack_https_frontend to allow SSL Chained Certificates.

Publicly issued SSL certificates are in recent years generally
issued from an intermediate root certificate, creating a trust
chain from the server certificate through the intermediate root
up to the ultimately trusted root CA certificate in the system
SSL store. Most clients (including firefox, wget and many python
SSL libraries) require the server to send the full SSL
certificate chain to the client to correctly validate this
arrangement (notably, Google Chrome does not. Beware of that
if testing this yourself).

apache2 >= 2.4.8 (xenial+) already handles this allowing you
to simply concatenate all 3 certificates in order (from leaf
to root) into the SSLCertificateFile and it automatically
handles sending this full chain to the client.

apache2 <= 2.4.7 (trusty-) requires this to be configured
separately with the SSLCertificateChainFile directive, refer
to the upstream documentation:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcertificatechainfile

We configure the SSLCertificateChainFile to use the same certificate
file as SSLCertificateFile. This works well allowing the same
configuration of simply concatenating all 3 certificates be used
on any version.

The presence of the server certificate in the chain file does not appear
to cause any problems. Because we re-use the existing certificate file,
no code changes are required in charms to support this.

Previously the ctrl plane VIP would default to 'br-ex' which in non-vlan

This closes CVE-2016-9599.

1) Sanitize dynamic HAproxy endpoints firewall rules

Build the hash of firewall rules only when a port is specified. The
HAproxy endpoints are using TCP protocol, which means we have to specify
a port to the IPtables rules.
Some services don't have public network exposure (e.g. Glance Registry),
which means they don't need haproxy_ssl rule.
The code prepare the hash depending on the service_port and
public_ssl_port parameters and create the actual firewall rules only if
one of those or both parameters are specified.
It will prevent new services without public exposure to open all traffic
because no port is specified.

2) Secure Firewall rules creations

The code won't allow to create TCP / UDP IPtables rules in INPUT
or OUTPUT chains without port or sport or dport, because doing it would
allow an IPtables rule opening all traffic for TCP or UDP.
If we try to do that, Puppet catalog will fail with an error explaining
why.
Example of use-cases:
- creating VRRP rules wouldn't require port parameters.
- creating TCP or UDP rules would require port parameters.

3) Allow to open all traffic for TCO / UDP (when desired)

Some use-cases require to open all traffic for all ports on TCP / UDP.
It will be possible if the user gives port = 'all' when creating the
firewall rule.

Backward compatibility:
- if our users created custom TCP / UDP firewall rules without port
  parameters, it won't work anymore, for security purpose.
- if you users want to open TCP / UDP for all ports, they need to pass
  port = 'all' and the rule will be created, though a warning will be
  displayed because this is insecure.
- if our users created custom VRRP rules without port parameters, it
  will still work correctly and rules will be created.
- TCP / UDP rules in FORWARD chain without port are still accepted.

In order to catch up they'll either need to add a large all-in-one patch

The keystoneclient-kerberos project is being retired. The project
was seldomly used, untested, and any logic it had was moved to
the keystoneauth project.

Change layout.yaml and projects.yaml according to the retirement
instructions [1].

This allows us to use the composable services interfaces to handle
providing the IP address for northd, and will be more flexible in
the event folks want to deploy northd/ovndb on a different node to
the neutron plugin.

This also adds ovn_northd to the haproxy configuration so we can access
it via the ovn_northd_vip in other service profiles.  Note we need
to ensure the haproxy config only hits the bootstrap node as northd
won't be running on the other nodes.

In the composable HA architecture we must be able to create
properties and resources from a pacemaker remote node (which
does not have neither corosync nor pacemaker running).
In order to be able to do that we need to relax the requires
and remove the ""Exec['wait-for-settle']"" which only exists
in the corosync class, which does not exist on a pacemaker remote
node.

The onus is on the user to make sure that the cluster is functional
before trying to create a resource from a pacemaker remote node.
In TripleO we do this by creating the resources only on step2.

The pacemaker_remote configuration for the remote node itself was
never really designed in to the current module, so tweaking the
existing corosync class to cater for remote nodes would mean rewriting
most of the class and is not worth it when we are actually trying
to merge with the ""new"" puppet pacemaker module in the future.

Currently the pacemaker_remote node configuration happens in a tripleo
profile: I92953afcc7d536d387381f08164cae8b52f41605

Note: Creating resources on a pacemaker remote node only works
with pcs-0.9.152 or later (CentOS/RHEL 7.3 and later)

HyperVNeutronAgent's _set_agent_state method depends on the fact that
_physical_network_mappings has already been set by the parent's class
init. The parent's class init depends on properties set in the
HyperVNeutronAgent's init.

Also, _setup_rpc will create the heartbeat daemon before the agent_state
is even initialized, which can cause the heartbeat to fail.

This patch simplifies the initialization process.

Adding constraints support to libraries is slightly more complex than
services as the libraries themselves are listed in upper-constraints.txt
which leads to errors that you can't install a specific version and a
constrained version.

This change adds constraints support by also adding a helper script to
edit the constraints to remove taskflow.

Adding constraints support to libraries is slightly more complex than
services as the libraries themselves are listed in upper-constraints.txt
which leads to errors that you can't install a specific version and a
constrained version.

This change adds constraints support by also adding a helper script to
edit the constraints to remove os-brick.

Finally, it also adds libxml2 and libxslt to bindep.txt for use when
building lxml that is now required by oslo.vmware.

This change adds a second plugin to the telegraf setup. A change is
being made to the telegraf config file to allow for more than one
external plugin to be executed and to allow for full plugin execution
between telegraf reporting intervals.

Each plugin will potentially account for up to 8 seconds of runtime with
the telegraf agent now using a dynamic reporting interval based on the
number of plugins a given agent is needing to execute.

A previous patch attempted to fix this issue, assuming that only the

This patch updates the swift proxy so that it only depends
on ceilometer if the ceilometer_api_enabled all-nodes-data hiera
setting has been set.

Also removes a parameter dependency where the
tripleo::profile::base::swift::proxy class was referencing
a puppet-ceilometer value from hiera (which can
also cause ceilometer dependencies).

This patch updates the swift-proxy base profile so that
we now explicitly set the rabbit_port. This allows us
to remove the use of puppet-ceilometer default settings
in the puppet-tripleo modules change ID here:
I8d9f69f5e9160543b372bd9886800f16f625fdc6

It also adds a new boolean parameter that allows the
end user to disable the swift ceilometer pipeline
by setting SwiftCeilometerPipelineEnabled to false.

This two settings allow Swift to once again be installed
on a machine without configuring Ceilometer.

The iscsi target session object returned by wmi can sometimes
be uppercase while the one sent by nova is always lowercase.
String comparisson for these names should take this into

Changes tripleo-ci so that only jobs with promote in their $TOCI_JOBTYPE
will have CACHEUPLOAD=1, so that these jobs will be the ones that
actually trigger a promote.

This allows us to disable overcloud delete and undercloud idempotent
from the promote jobs, but still have periodic jobs that test these
features. Given that our check-tripleo jobs that we treat as gating do
not test these features, I think it's reasonable that we shouldn't block
promotes on them either.

The change in mirror-server.pp to the cron job that actually does the
promote based on job name will need to be applied manually by an admin
if this change merges.

This enables the deployer to dynamically add nova metadata to the
servers based on the output of service profiles that implement the
metadata_settings key in the role_data output for the profiles.

One can set an implementation via the OS::TripleO::ServerMetadataHook
resource, which currently is set as OS::Heat::None. So, because of
the default implementation, if left untouched it actually does
nothing.

Currently, besides the list, which is metadata_settings, this hook also
takes the name of the node that it's setting the metadata for.

This is useful for nova vendordata plugins that can parse said metadata.

When extending a volume in a THIN pool, Cinder has no checks of whether
the new allocated space is provisioned by the backend. This allow a
tenant, with enough quota space to extend the volume to a size much
higher than the provisioned space reported by the backend.

So, by routing the extend request through the scheduler, it will
assure that the host can provision the needed space.
