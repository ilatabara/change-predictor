This commit is a product of two separate commits in order to unwedge
the stable/newton gate. The first commit is a oauth refactor to
properly handle token exceptions. The second is a patch to that
uses the proper url when verifying an oauth request token. The
problem is that the second patch can't be applied due to the
refactor from the first. This commit merges the two commits
together so that their isn't a merge conflict and it passes the
currently broken gate.

The first commit is:

Handle the exception from creating access token properly

If there is any request from client with any invalid request
parameters, invalid signature for example, keystone should
capture that and raise the exception.

It was `NotImplementedError`, `TypeError` thrown out and
presented directly to end user, and nothing helpful message
is given.

This patch fix that and show as many exception message that
is helpful for diagnosis as possible.

(cherry picked from commit be5385c5389aa9c4879647c9b9e4327cc73189a2)

This is the second commit

Change url passed to oauth signature verifier to request url

OAUTH signature verification should happen with the same URL used for signing.
Typically at the user end it should be signed with the request URL and hence it
should be verified with the same.
Currently keystone uses public endpoint URL for signature verification.

Modified the URL passed to oauth signature verification to request URL.

cliff has a concept of FormattableColumn which allows CLI implementors
to convert data into human-readable format only when a human-readable
format is requested and keep data unconverted for manchine-readable
formats like JSON or YAML.

Deprecation warnings is now emitted in favor of using FormattableColumn.

The structure of the page changed slightly between July 8th
and now (thanks Internet Archive).
Adapt the extraction code. including a more robust regex.

Also update the download location (lightbend.com instead of
typesafe.com, even if the latter is still a redirect).

Finally, expose a new variable which allows users to
force a specific version of Scala, disabling the autodetection.
This is useful to workaround possible future similar breakages
without changing the code.

So I think this has the most functionality we can expect of a stub
at this point, it accepts a configured transport URL and node id
then takes rpc commands to modify the state of the agent.

What needs to be added is a accelerator handler class that runs
in the main loop to perform the various ongoing tasks of the Agent
but I can't really write that until I have a driver to link against.

Commit 01444b18c83b (""test-setup-swifthosts: Optimize xfsprogs
installation"") switched from using distro specific package manager
modules to a simpler solution provided by the 'package' module. However,
this had unexpected consequences when the task is delegated. In this
case, the detection depends on hostvars['localhost']['ansible_pkg_mgr']
being populated. However, this may not always be true since it depends
on us having executed the 'setup' module on localhost during this

Non-persistent boot device change is not being used in places
where it should be during cleaning and deployment phases,
due to the default behavior of PXE interface forcing a
persistent change when using legacy function
deploy_utils.try_set_boot_device.
For some drivers, e.g. OneView, a persistent change is far more

Fixes a problem where SR-IOV VF count configuration will fail if a
physical function is in use by a guest when 'puppet apply' is executed.
This change substitutes warnings for failures and skips complaints if a
PCI device is unavailable.

Note: this patch has the side-effect of allowing the same configuration
data on hosts that may *not* or *ever* have PCI SR-IOV devices on the
hardware. Time will tell how evil this is in practice.

Fixes a problem where SR-IOV VF count configuration will fail if a
physical function is in use by a guest when 'puppet apply' is executed.
This change substitutes warnings for failures and skips complaints if a
PCI device is unavailable.

Note: this patch has the side-effect of allowing the same configuration
data on hosts that may *not* or *ever* have PCI SR-IOV devices on the
hardware. Time will tell how evil this is in practice.

The keystone db sync --check option is only available
in Pike. Trying to use this option causes the db sync
processes to run every time the playbook is executed,
resulting in the keystone service being stopped. The
service is also never notified to restart, so it never
does.

This patch uses just the local facts to determine
whether or not to execute the db sync actions, and
properly notifies the service to restart afterwards.

Note:
This includes a re-implementation of https://review.openstack.org/483309
which is different due to the fact that master exclusively uses uwsgi.

If there is any request from client with any invalid request
parameters, invalid signature for example, keystone should
capture that and raise the exception.

It was `NotImplementedError`, `TypeError` thrown out and
presented directly to end user, and nothing helpful message
is given.

This patch fix that and show as many exception message that
is helpful for diagnosis as possible.

This commit is primarily a reorganisation fo our settings documentation.
The aim is to move away from the horizon / openstack_dashboard / django
distinction, which makes little sense to non-devs. This will be replaced
by a split between general horizon settings, service-specific settings,
and upstream Django settings. as well as organising the settings in

This patch also improves visiblity of deprecation, adds missing

and many settings were also updated to reference other relevant

The hw_video:ram_max_mb flavor extra spec is only used by the
libvirt driver and was added back in Icehouse as part
of blueprint libvirt-video-driver-selection.

For whatever reason, it was used to count against a project's
ram quota when an instance was created but failed to be
accounted for during an instance delete, at least until that
bug was fixed over 3 years later in Pike with commit f2d03bf92.

This is the only flavor extra spec that is counted against
quota in the API and is only used by a single virt driver.
If something like this is going to actually be counted, it
should probably be as part of the overhead calculation that
happens in the compute service as part of the resource claim
on the host.

Also note that this is not counted as part of the MEMORY_MB
allocation record for the instance with the Placement service,
which means it's not accounted for when scheduling and selecting
a destination host.

With blueprint cells-count-resources-to-check-quota-in-api changing
how we count quota usage from the API, this special snowflake will
also cause problems as it's not tracked in the instances table
record like vcpus and memory_mb are tracked, so we'd have to slow
down the DB queries by doing extra joins for flavor extra specs
to account for this extra overhead that is probably rarely used
in most deployments, which is even more apparent given the
usage decrement issue wasn't fixed until over 3 years after the
feature was added.

Therefore this change removes the counting of the hw_video:ram_max_mb
flavor extra spec value against the project quota in the API.

This patch adds ability to translate swift account project name to UUID and update
glance/swift_account option in the following format 'AUTH_uuid'.

By either calling ironic_config directly:

  ironic_config {
    'glance/swift_account': value => 'swift_account_project_name', transform_to => 'project_uuid'

or by defining ::ironic::glance class:

This patch removes hardcoded type for 'baremetal' Neutron network.
Update ironic conductor config with new config option:
  * enabled_network_interfaces - list of enabled network interfaces on
    Ironic conductor
  * cleaning_network_name - name of Neutron network to be used
    during node cleaning
  * provisioning_network_name - name of Neutron network to be used
    during node provisioning

Add openrc generation task for nodes with ironic role, needed as it is
required for translation from name to uuid.

This patch adds support to deploy Ironic with separate Neutron network
for provisioning baremetal instances.

  * Add NetworkDeploymentSerializer100 as Ironic multitenancy is supported

  * Update network scheme generation to create 'vlan' baremetal network,
    assign IPs to Ironic conductors from this network, make them

This patch adds support to deploy Ironic with separate Neutron network
for provisioning baremetal instances.

  * Add NetworkDeploymentSerializer100 as Ironic multitenancy is supported
    from Newton, and we will backport this till stable/newton.
  * Update network scheme generation to create 'vlan' baremetal network,
    assign IPs to Ironic conductors from this network, make them
    accessible from baremetal servers.
  * Add new checkbox at 'Openstack Settings/Additional components' tab
    which allows to define if separate provisioning network should be used
    during deployment. This is a trigger to switch ironic deployment to
    multitenancy case. If not selected old behaviour is kept, 'flat'
    network is used. The checkbox is shown only when Ironic component is
    enabled.

With snap packaging (see snapcraft.io) the package is installed into a
read-only squashfs filesystem, which includes the default config. For
example, $SNAP/etc/nova/nova.conf. To override the defaults, a separate
writable directory is used, and this directory is also unique to the snap.
For example, either $SNAP_COMMON/etc/nova/nova.conf, or
$SNAP_COMMON/etc/nova/nova.conf.d/ can be used to override config.

This patch adds these snap directories to the default config paths where
oslo looks for config.

Initial implementation

Changes in the mechanism driver:

    * Automatically create a port with device_owner=network:dhcp to
      serve metadata and eventually DHCP.
    * Auto-allocate an IP for the metadata port on subnet creation.
    * Push static route for 169.254.169.254 in DHCP options.
    * Wait until metadata service is provisioned in the chassis where
      a port resides before sending the event to Nova.

Agent:

    * Implementation of [0].

Devstack plugin:

    * Starts networking-ovn-agent with the proper config files.
    * Disables config drive in nova.conf for tempest against master
      branch.
    * Enables TEMPEST_RUN_VALIDATION for tempest against master branch.

In order to test this patch out we need to make these changes to
nova.conf:

    * [DEFAULT] section:
      force_config_drive = False
    * [neutron] section:
      service_metadata_proxy = True

This patch depends on [1] and [2] (already merged into OVS master).
NOTE: Metadata tests are only enabled for the non-voting tempest job
      which runs against OVS master branch. The release job runs against
      OVS 2.7 which doesn't include [1][2] so those tests are disabled
      until OVS 2.8 is released.

This file set is sorted, so as to provide a predictable parse order if individual options are over-ridden. The set is parsed after the file(s) specified via previous --config-file, arguments hence over-ridden options in the directory take precedence. ``--config-file PATH`` Path to a config file to use.

Default: None. This option is ignored if ``log_config_append`` is set. ``--log-dir LOG_DIR, --logdir LOG_DIR`` (Optional) The base directory used for relative ``log-file`` paths. This option is ignored if ``log_config_append`` is set. ``--log-file PATH, --logfile PATH`` (Optional) Name of log file to output to.

This is a start to have tempest handle Cinder API versions
based on what is actually enabled. There are currently a
lot of places in the code the assume v1 and v2 are available,
but those versions may be disabled, especially as we try to
get everyone moved onto the latest (final?) v3 API version.

There are more areas that should be fixed up before we can
actually just work with v3 only, but this is a start to get
there.

1. What is the problem
The resource routing list operations will retrieve all the items in
the database, which will consume too much memory and take long time
to response when the results are considerably large.

2. What is the solution for the problem
To reduce load on the service, list operations will return a maximum
number of items at a time by pagination. To navigate the collection,
the parameters limit and marker can be set in the URI. For example:

/v1.0/routings?limit=2000&marker=500

The marker parameter is the ID of the last item in the previous list.
A marker with an invalid ID returns a badRequest (400) fault.
The limit parameter sets the page size. These parameters are optional.
If the client requests a limit beyond the maximum limit configured by
the deployment, the server returns the maximum limit number of items.
Pagination and filtering can work together with routing's list operations.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle to
realize the solution
Add pagination feature for resource routing list operations.

This change adds a flag for enabling UUID validation
on the UUIDField Type.

It currently defaults to False, to allow Nova and other project to
continue with the current behaviour, but allow other projects to use
it.

There is a follow on patch that depricates the validate=False
and will force projects that cannot use this feature to explictily set
this to False.

There can then be an additional deprication cycle for that kwarg,
to make it always validate.

This introduce a concept of validation, which allows to check the values
of objects' fields when they are assigned.

FieldType class has got a new attribute '_validators', which is a list
of validators (functions of appropriate signature) and a 'validate'
method which iterates over the list of validators and checks
if the given value satisfies the conditions defined by those validators.

A validator is a function which accepts an object, an attribute name and
a value as paramters. It should return a tuple of a boolean and a
string, where string should contain a message to be included into
exception if the boolean is 'False'.

A Field class is mofified to call the 'validate' method of the
field_type object.

A developer may add any custom validators to any field (by passing a
list of functions / lambdas as a ""validators"" parameter of FieldType
constructor), but the validators for the most common field types are
included into this patch:
 - for String fields:
   - min_length - ensures the minimal length of a string
   - max_length - ensures the maximim length of a string
   - pattern - ensures that a string matches specific regex pattern

 - for Integer fields:
   - minimum - ensures that a value is greater or equal than minimum
   - maximum - ensures that a value is lower or equal than maximum
   - multiple of - ensures that a value is a multiple of specific value

 - for Float fields:
   - minimum - ensures that a value is greater or equal than minimum
   - maximum - ensures that a value is lower or equal than maximum

 - for DateTime fields:
   - minimum - ensures that a value is greater or equal than minimum
   - maximum - ensures that a value is lower or equal than maximum

To add a convinient aliases for validatable fields of appropriate type
the 'AutoTypedField' class is improved. It addition to existing
'AUTO_TYPE' attribute a new one - called 'AUTO_TYPE_CLASS' - is added.
It defines the field type not as an instance, but as a class, which gets
instantiated in field's __init__, so each field type may be
parameterized with appropriate constraints.

Appropriate field types (StringField, IntegerField, FloatField,
DateTimeField) are modified to use this new functionality.

(The dependency is needed, as otherwise nova's unit tests will be
broken: the change of enums to coerce their 'valid_values' modifies
the string representation of unicode fields)

It seems strange that we uses message ack together with qos=0.
Imagine that a RPC Server is stuck and all workers in a pool is blocked.
In this case AMQPListener still consume new messages from a queue and puts
them to the work queue of executor which does not have any limits.

So, the RPC Server does not respond, but we still consuming all messages
from the queue. I think this is not good.

This starts to add in some basic level of message validation
that can be used to verify that a message at least came from
a source that can produce the same hmac via the same shared
key and discards message that do not match the provided key.

If no key is provided to the 'deserialize_msg' and 'serialize_msg'
functions then they just continue to operate as before, but if
provided then they will validate and reject messages that do not
match the expected hmac.

This doesn't require the full kite integration or complex
key infrastructure that is required for something more advanced
but at least starts to add something that can provide some basic
level of sanity to messages.

This patchset continues the work started local to
Neutron in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/332476/ to
apply to oslo_db overall.   The provisioning system
now draws its database configuration from an enginefacade-oriented
factory.  The idea is that since projects typically make their
own enginefacade in their db/api.py module, this facade and all
of its configuration now serves as the factory for the test suite
as well.

Additionally, fixtures have been opened up to allow for a
""static SQL"" fixture that keeps a single SQLite database open
without dropping it, support for deleting from tables as a teardown scheme,
and also moves out the ""transactional"" test concept from the
provisioning system and into a Fixture, as is more appropriate
for any setup/teardown that only spans a single test.

This is an incomplete WIP.

create, and having both defined in a single place should keep it more

In profiling the load speed of openstackclient it was determined that
the majority of the oslo_config load time was spent in loading netaddr
which is only used for the IPAddress type.

The ipaddress module is available in the python stdlib as of python 3.3
however has been backported to python 2 and is much lighter weight so we
should use that for IP validation instead of netaddr.

When connecting encrypted volumes we need to return a symbolink link or
we will break all future attachments after detaching the volume.

OS-Brick on 1.14 and 1.15 returns real paths instead of returning symbolic
links, which results in the encryption attach_volume call replacing the
real device with a link to the crypt dm.

The issue comes from the Nova flow when attaching an encrypted volume:

1- Attach volume
2- Generate libvirt configuration with path from step 1
3- Encrypt attach volume

Since step 2 has already generated the config with the path from step 1 then
step 3 must preserve this path.

When step 1 returns a symbolic link we just forcefully replace it with a link
to the crypt dm and everything is OK, but when we return a real path it
does the same thing, which means we'll be replacing for example /dev/sda
with a symlink, which will then break the detach process, and all future
attachments.

Until Nova, Cinder, and OS-Brick are changed to have a different flow
(1, 3, 2) we need a workaround to make it work.

The workaround this patch introduces is to return a symbolic link when
the volume is encrypted.

It will try to return the symlink that always exists, but if it's not
there it will just look for ANY link to the device in '/dev/disk/by-id'.

This can pose a security risk for applications who's object model contains passwords or other sensitive data. Problem description =================== At a high level, the Murano workflow from an end user's perspective is as follows: # Create an environment. # Create a session on that environment. # Configure the session by adding values for each property needed to deploy that application. # Deploy the application. In the case of a MySQL[0]_ app for example, the password that the user enters via the murano-dashboard will be stored in plain text in both the ``session`` and ``environment`` tables. This info is available both to the cloud admin, other users in the same project, and also to an attacker should the database become compromised. Proposed change =============== This spec proposes to encrypt this data using Castellan[1]_ which is a generic key manager interface for OpenStack. Castellan is designed to be used with a variety of secret storage backends, the most common being Barbican[2]_. The Castellan key manager is already being used by the Nova and Cinder project to name two[3]_. Because Barbican is the default storage backend, Barbican and Castellan will be referred to interchangeably for the rest of this document. The workflow outlined in the description will remain the same for both end users and application authors. The difference behind the scenes is that instead of session/environment data being written directly into the database, it will be sent as a blob to Barbican, the result of which is a uuid key that will be stored in it's place. Any point in the Murano code that wishes to access the data must be updated to fetch the data from Barbican using the uuid. Note, data will only be encrypted at rest, i.e. in the api. The Murano engine should not have any knowledge of Barbican. Alternatives ------------ There are two pieces of this implementation which could be done differently. The first is the encryption of the data itself. Some questions have been raised as to the usefulness of Barbican as a whole[4]_. Some community members are concerned with adding it as ""yet another dependency"" to their project, while other's have concerns about it's integration with Keystone with regards to secret storage. The dependency issue can be somewhat allieved by the use of Castellan, though it should be noted Castellan does not appear to currently provide any ""dummy"" backend drivers[5]_. With regards to security, the argument that Barbican is the common solution for secret storage in OpenStack seems reasonable; security is something best left to specialists in the field. If a flaw is discovered in Barbican, it can be patched once by an operator and all projects using it will automatically benefit. The second is the way the data model is encrypted, and whether or not the application author gets a say in this. As stated above, this change proposes to encrypt the entire ``description`` field of both and environment and session, rather than break it apart and encrypt only specific properties. The benefit of this is that it is transparent to the users, application authors don't need to concern themselves with which keys should or should not be encrypted. It is safer to encrypt everything. Data model impact ----------------- The main change to the data model will be that instead of a json blob being stored in the ``description`` field of the ``environment`` and ``session`` tables, we will store a uuid which points to this data in the key manager. This should not require any migrations as both structures can be represented as strings, the only difference being the uuid is considerably smaller. Care will need to be taken to support both old and new data formats in the code to ensure backwards compatibility. We do not suggest migrating/encrypting old entries. REST API impact --------------- None Versioning impact ----------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Deployer impact --------------- Unless we or Castellan can provide an insecure ""dummy"" key manager, deployers will be required to deploy Barbican along side Murano. This may be an unreasonable ask, so we should interact with the Castellan community to see what their recommendations are in this are. The alternative is to allow deployers to disable encryption entirely in the event a secret storage backend is unavailable. This will also be a concern for CI and functional testing. When using the Barbican backend, the following snippet must be added the api murano.conf: :: [barbican] auth_endpoint = <keystone_uri>:<keystone_public_port> Developer impact ---------------- None Murano-dashboard / Horizon impact --------------------------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: paul.bourke@oracle.com Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Integrate basic Castellan functionality into Murano. * Update each API workflow that gets/sets the object model in the API to be Castellan aware. * Potentially write a dummy backend for Castellan to aid testing / operators who don't wish to use this functionality. Dependencies ============ * Castellan Testing ======= * Appropriate unit and functional tests will need to be added. * Potentially the tempest tests could be updated for full end to end testing with Barbican. Documentation Impact ==================== Deployment docs will need info on Barbican configuration for Murano.

The keystone db sync --check option is only available
in Pike. Trying to use this option causes the db sync
processes to run every time the playbook is executed,
resulting in the keystone service being stopped. The
service is also never notified to restart, so it never
does.

This patch uses just the local facts to determine
whether or not to execute the db sync actions, and
properly notifies the service to restart afterwards.

Note:
This includes a re-implementation of https://review.openstack.org/483309
which is different due to the fact that master exclusively uses uwsgi.

When writing tests, it is useful to be able to look at the database
being modified. Since we use OVS virtual environments and delete
them when the test ends, this is difficult to do.

This patch adds the ability to pass KEEP_ENV=1 when running tox to
keep the virtual environment around and adds tools/debug_venv to
launch an OVS sandbox using the OVS virtual environment.

Web Services Management (WS-Management and WS-Man) requests/commands can
fail or return invalid results when issued to an Integrated Dell Remote
Access Controller (iDRAC) whose Lifecycle Controller remote service is
not ""ready"". Specifically, that applies to the WS-Man Enumerate and

A Dell technical white paper [0], ""Lifecycle Controller Integration --
Best Practices Guide"", states that for Lifecycle Controller firmware
1.5.0 and later ""The Lifecycle Controller remote service must be in a

almost all of the workflows and use cases documented by that paper and
supported by this project, openstack/python-dracclient. That document
describes how to determine the readiness of the Lifecycle Controller
remote service. A project commit [1] implements that.

This refactors that patch in preparation for changing the internal
implementation of the project's APIs so that they follow that best
practice. The implementation of is_idrac_ready() and
wait_until_idrac_is_ready() have been relocated further down the call
stack, to the iDRAC specialization of the WS-Man client defined by class
dracclient.client.WSManClient. Those methods continue to be available

Add new overcloud cli command in order to dump
all the configs from the overcloud contains in role_data.
All different type of configs are dump in a separate file
per role ex:
ls config/tmpD2nDOd-config/
config_settings-Compute.yaml
global_config_settings-Compute.yaml
logging_sources-Compute.yaml
monitoring_subscriptions-Compute.yaml
service_config_settings-Compute.yaml

upgrade_batch_tasks-Compute.yaml
upgrade_tasks-Compute.yaml

The upgrade_tasks is in yaml format and can be directly
call with ansible-playbook command, example:

$ cat config/tmpD2nDOd-config/upgrade_tasks-Compute.yaml
- hosts: Compute
  name: Compute playbook
  tasks:
  - name: Stop snmp service
    service: name=snmpd state=stopped
    tags: step1
  - name: Stop nova-compute service
    service: name=openstack-nova-compute state=stopped
    tags: step1

This patch to allow operators to run manually
the upgrade tasks via ansible on the Undercloud.

For example, to manipulate nodes, you interact with an `ironicclient.v1.node`_ object. You obtain access to nodes via attributes of the `ironicclient.v1.client.Client`_ object. Usage ===== Get a Client object ------------------- First, create an `ironicclient.v1.client.Client`_ instance by passing your credentials to `ironicclient.client.get_client()`_. By default, the Bare Metal Provisioning system is configured so that only administrators (users with 'admin' role) have access. .. note:: Explicit instantiation of `ironicclient.v1.client.Client`_ may cause errors since it doesn't verify provided arguments, using `ironicclient.client.get_client()` is preferred way to get client object. There are two different sets of credentials that can be used:: * ironic endpoint and auth token * Identity Service (keystone) credentials Using ironic endpoint and auth token .................................... An auth token and the ironic endpoint can be used to authenticate:: * os_auth_token: authentication token (from Identity Service) * ironic_url: ironic API endpoint, eg http://ironic.example.org:6385/v1 To create the client, you can use the API like so:: >>> from ironicclient import client >>> >>> kwargs = {'os_auth_token': '3bcc3d3a03f44e3d8377f9247b0ad155', >>> 'ironic_url': 'http://ironic.example.org:6385/'} >>> ironic = client.get_client(1, **kwargs) Using Identity Service (keystone) credentials ............................................. These Identity Service credentials can be used to authenticate:: * os_username: name of user * os_password: user's password * os_auth_url: Identity Service endpoint for authorization * insecure: Boolean. If True, does not perform X.509 certificate validation when establishing SSL connection with identity service. default: False (optional) * os_tenant_{name|id}: name or ID of tenant To create a client, you can use the API like so:: >>> from ironicclient import client >>> >>> kwargs = {'os_username': 'name', >>> 'os_password': 'password', >>> 'os_auth_url': 'http://keystone.example.org:5000/', >>> 'os_project_name': 'project'} >>> ironic = client.get_client(1, **kwargs) Perform ironic operations ------------------------- Once you have an ironic `Client`_, you can perform various tasks:: >>> ironic.driver.list() # list of drivers >>> ironic.node.list() # list of nodes >>> ironic.node.get(node_uuid) # information about a particular node When the `Client`_ needs to propagate an exception, it will usually raise an instance subclassed from `ironicclient.exc.BaseException`_ or `ironicclient.exc.ClientException`_. Refer to the modules themselves, for more details. ironicclient Modules ==================== .. toctree:: :maxdepth: 1 modules <api/autoindex> .. _ironicclient.v1.node: api/ironicclient.v1.node.html#ironicclient.v1.node.Node .. _ironicclient.v1.client.Client: api/ironicclient.v1.client.html#ironicclient.v1.client.Client .. _Client: api/ironicclient.v1.client.html#ironicclient.v1.client.Client .. _ironicclient.client.get_client(): api/ironicclient.client.html#ironicclient.client.get_client .. _ironicclient.exc.BaseException: api/ironicclient.exc.html#ironicclient.exc.BaseException .. _ironicclient.exc.ClientException: api/ironicclient.exc.html#ironicclient.exc.ClientException ",7,110

This type of monitoring ensures you can automatically scale in or out a group of instances through the Orchestration service, but you can also use alarms for general-purpose awareness of your cloud resources' health. These alarms follow a tri-state model: ok The rule governing the alarm has been evaluated as ``False``. alarm The rule governing the alarm have been evaluated as ``True``. insufficient data There are not enough datapoints available in the evaluation periods to meaningfully determine the alarm state. Alarm definitions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The definition of an alarm provides the rules that govern when a state transition should occur, and the actions to be taken thereon. The nature of these rules depend on the alarm type. Threshold rule alarms --------------------- For conventional threshold-oriented alarms, state transitions are governed by: * A static threshold value with a comparison operator such as greater than or less than. * A statistic selection to aggregate the data. * A sliding time window to indicate how far back into the recent past you want to look. Valid threshold alarms are: ``gnocchi_resources_threshold_rule``, ``gnocchi_aggregation_by_metrics_threshold_rule``, or ``gnocchi_aggregation_by_resources_threshold_rule``. .. note:: As of Ocata, the ``threshold`` alarm is deprecated since Ceilometer's native storage API is deprecated. Composite rule alarms --------------------- Composite alarms enable users to define an alarm with multiple triggering conditions, using a combination of ``and`` and ``or`` relations. Combination rule alarms ----------------------- .. note:: Combination alarms are deprecated as of Newton for composite alarms. Combination alarm functionality is removed in Pike. The Telemetry service also supports the concept of a meta-alarm, which aggregates over the current state of a set of underlying basic alarms combined via a logical operator (``and`` or ``or``). Alarm dimensioning ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A key associated concept is the notion of *dimensioning* which defines the set of matching meters that feed into an alarm evaluation. Recall that meters are per-resource-instance, so in the simplest case an alarm might be defined over a particular meter applied to all resources visible to a particular user. More useful however would be the option to explicitly select which specific resources you are interested in alarming on. At one extreme you might have narrowly dimensioned alarms where this selection would have only a single target (identified by resource ID). At the other extreme, you could have widely dimensioned alarms where this selection identifies many resources over which the statistic is aggregated. For example all instances booted from a particular image or all instances with matching user metadata (the latter is how the Orchestration service identifies autoscaling groups). Alarm evaluation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Alarms are evaluated by the ``alarm-evaluator`` service on a periodic basis, defaulting to once every minute. Alarm actions ------------- Any state transition of individual alarm (to ``ok``, ``alarm``, or ``insufficient data``) may have one or more actions associated with it. These actions effectively send a signal to a consumer that the state transition has occurred, and provide some additional context. This includes the new and previous states, with some reason data describing the disposition with respect to the threshold, the number of datapoints involved and most recent of these. State transitions are detected by the ``alarm-evaluator``, whereas the ``alarm-notifier`` effects the actual notification action. **Webhooks** These are the *de facto* notification type used by Telemetry alarming and simply involve an HTTP POST request being sent to an endpoint, with a request body containing a description of the state transition encoded as a JSON fragment. **Log actions** These are a lightweight alternative to webhooks, whereby the state transition is simply logged by the ``alarm-notifier``, and are intended primarily for testing purposes. Workload partitioning --------------------- The alarm evaluation process uses the same mechanism for workload partitioning as the central and compute agents. The `Tooz <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tooz>`_ library provides the coordination within the groups of service instances. For further information about this approach, see the `high availability guide <https://docs.openstack.org/ha-guide/controller-ha-telemetry.html>`_. To use this workload partitioning solution set the ``evaluation_service`` option to ``default``. For more information, see the alarm section in the `OpenStack Configuration Reference <https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/telemetry.html>`_. Using alarms ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Alarm creation -------------- An example of creating a Gnocchi threshold-oriented alarm, based on an upper bound on the CPU utilization for a particular instance: .. code-block:: console $ aodh alarm create --name cpu_hi \ --type gnocchi_resources_threshold \ --description 'instance running hot' \ --metric cpu_util --threshold 70.0 \ --comparison-operator gt --aggregation_method avg \ --granularity 600 --evaluation-periods 3 \ --alarm-action 'log://' --resource_id INSTANCE_ID This creates an alarm that will fire when the average CPU utilization for an individual instance exceeds 70% for three consecutive 10 minute periods. The notification in this case is simply a log message, though it could alternatively be a webhook URL. .. note:: Alarm names must be unique for the alarms associated with an individual project. Administrator can limit the maximum resulting actions for three different states, and the ability for a normal user to create ``log://`` and ``test://`` notifiers is disabled. This prevents unintentional consumption of disk and memory resources by the Telemetry service. The sliding time window over which the alarm is evaluated is 30 minutes in this example. This window is not clamped to wall-clock time boundaries, rather it's anchored on the current time for each evaluation cycle, and continually creeps forward as each evaluation cycle rolls around (by default, this occurs every minute). .. note:: The alarm granularity must match the granularities of the metric configured in Gnocchi. Otherwise the alarm will tend to flit in and out of the ``insufficient data`` state due to the mismatch between the actual frequency of datapoints in the metering store and the statistics queries used to compare against the alarm threshold. If a shorter alarm period is needed, then the corresponding interval should be adjusted in the ``pipeline.yaml`` file. Other notable alarm attributes that may be set on creation, or via a subsequent update, include: state The initial alarm state (defaults to ``insufficient data``). description A free-text description of the alarm (defaults to a synopsis of the alarm rule). enabled True if evaluation and actioning is to be enabled for this alarm (defaults to ``True``). repeat-actions True if actions should be repeatedly notified while the alarm remains in the target state (defaults to ``False``). ok-action An action to invoke when the alarm state transitions to ``ok``. insufficient-data-action An action to invoke when the alarm state transitions to ``insufficient data``. time-constraint Used to restrict evaluation of the alarm to certain times of the day or days of the week (expressed as ``cron`` expression with an optional timezone). An example of creating a combination alarm, based on the combined state of two underlying alarms: .. code-block:: console $ aodh alarm create --name meta --type composite \ --composite-rule '{""or"":[{""threshold"": 0.8,""metric"": ""cpu_util"", ""type"": \ ""gnocchi_resources_threshold"", ""resource_id"": INSTANCE_ID, \ ""aggregation-method"": ""last""},{""threshold"": 0.8,""metric"": ""cpu_util"", \ ""type"": ""gnocchi_resources_threshold"", ""resource_id"": INSTANCE_ID2, \ ""aggregation-method"": ""last""}]}' \ --alarm-action 'http://example.org/notify' This creates an alarm that will fire when either one of two underlying alarms transition into the alarm state. The notification in this case is a webhook call. Any number of underlying alarms can be combined in this way, using either ``and`` or ``or``. Additionally, combinations can contain nested conditions: .. code-block:: console $ aodh alarm create --name meta --type composite \ --composite-rule '{""or"":[ALARM_1, {""and"":[ALARM2, ALARM3]}]}' --alarm-action 'http://example.org/notify' Alarm retrieval --------------- You can display all your alarms via (some attributes are omitted for brevity): .. code-block:: console $ aodh alarm list +----------+-----------+--------+-------------------+----------+---------+ | Alarm ID | Type | Name | State | Severity | Enabled | +----------+-----------+--------+-------------------+----------+---------+ | ALARM_ID | threshold | cpu_hi | insufficient data | high | True | +----------+-----------+--------+-------------------+----------+---------+ In this case, the state is reported as ``insufficient data`` which could indicate that: * meters have not yet been gathered about this instance over the evaluation window into the recent past (for example a brand-new instance) * *or*, that the identified instance is not visible to the user/project owning the alarm * *or*, simply that an alarm evaluation cycle hasn't kicked off since the alarm was created (by default, alarms are evaluated once per minute). .. note:: The visibility of alarms depends on the role and project associated with the user issuing the query: * admin users see *all* alarms, regardless of the owner * non-admin users see only the alarms associated with their project (as per the normal project segregation in OpenStack) Alarm update ------------ Once the state of the alarm has settled down, we might decide that we set that bar too low with 70%, in which case the threshold (or most any other alarm attribute) can be updated thusly: .. code-block:: console $ aodh alarm update ALARM_ID --threshold 75 The change will take effect from the next evaluation cycle, which by default occurs every minute. Most alarm attributes can be changed in this way, but there is also a convenient short-cut for getting and setting the alarm state: .. code-block:: console $ openstack alarm state get ALARM_ID $ openstack alarm state set --state ok ALARM_ID Over time the state of the alarm may change often, especially if the threshold is chosen to be close to the trending value of the statistic. You can follow the history of an alarm over its lifecycle via the audit API: .. code-block:: console $ aodh alarm-history show ALARM_ID +------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------+ | Type | Timestamp | Detail | +------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------+ | creation | time0 | name: cpu_hi | | | | description: instance running hot | | | | type: threshold | | | | rule: cpu_util > 70.0 during 3 x 600s | | state transition | time1 | state: ok | | rule change | time2 | rule: cpu_util > 75.0 during 3 x 600s | +------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------+ Alarm deletion -------------- An alarm that is no longer required can be disabled so that it is no longer actively evaluated: .. code-block:: console $ aodh alarm update --enabled False -a ALARM_ID or even deleted permanently (an irreversible step): .. code-block:: console $ aodh alarm delete ALARM_ID ",,351,0

This patch adds the bulk of the code for claiming resources for
instances against a particular host during the primary _schedule() loop
in the filter scheduler. Because the state objects are tightly coupled
to the way that the filters and weighers operate in the filter
scheduler driver, we need to co-locate the claim resources code with
the code that loops through the filters and weighers.

In the code submitted here, we attempt to claim resources for each
instance in spec_obj.num_instances. For each of *those* attempts, we
keep trying to claim the resources against each host in the weighed
list of hosts returned in each loop after calling the host manager
get_filtered_hosts() method. If we fail to claim against a particular
host, we try another allocation request that matches that compute node.
If those all fail, we try the next host in the weighed hosts list.

Only if we successfully claim (in the placement API) resources for an
instance against a host do we call the host state object's
consume_from_instance() method or modify the spec_obj's instance group
state tracking. This ensures that logic around instance group affinity
and anti-affinity as well as logic that reduces resource capacity in
the host state objects only occurs if we've actually successfully
claimed resources in the placement API.

Finally, after successfully claiming resources for an instance, we
return a dict, keyed by instance UUID, that contains a list of the
allocation requests for each instance that was claimed. The first
allocation request in the list is the one that was used in the
successful claim for that instance. The remaining allocation requests
represent possible alternate destinations for the workload if the
launch request ends up failing on the originally-targeted host. All
alternate allocation requests will be for compute nodes in the same
cell as the originally-selected host.

After trying to fit the square peg of allocations into the round hole
that is the current design of the scheduler, I realized that due to the
way that state is kept in the host manager and the scheduler driver,
that I would unfortunately not be able to isolate the claim logic in
the scheduler manager. Instead, due to the way that the host state

may be invoke self.connection = None which will raise
""AttributeError: can't set attribute"". Because the invoke class has
not method for connection which decorator @connection.setter:

@connection.setter
def connection(self, value):
    self._connection = value

You can find how to use @property decorator over here:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property

In Pike, the goal is to support multiple cells v2 cells in a deployment. There are several priority efforts to get us there. * `Cells-aware API`_: Many of the nova-api entry points will not know about cells properly to pass their operations through to the appropriate connection so we need to make them cell-aware. * `Quotas in the API cell`_: The quotas tables have moved to the API database but we want to avoid an 'up-call' from the compute cells to the API when handling quota commits and rollbacks. With cells v2 we have an opportunity to rethink how Nova supports counting resources and tracking quota, so this effort aims to move quota handling to a more simplified solution which is more eventually consistent and avoids invalid over-quota failures by design. * Support a simple python merge operation when sorting and/or filtering a list of instances across multiple cells. Long-term this may be handled by `Searchlight`_ but for Pike we will have a simple but albeit less performant solution. * Continuous integration testing of multiple cells v2 cells with a multi-node job. .. note:: Move operations, such as live migration, will not be supported in the Pike release, but may be a focus for a future release. .. _Cells-aware API: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/cells-aware-api .. _Quotas in the API cell: ../specs/pike/approved/cells-count-resources-to-check-quota-in-api.html .. _Searchlight: ../specs/pike/approved/list-instances-using-searchlight.html Placement --------- The Placement service was made required in the Ocata release. In Pike, the goals focus on expanding the capabilities of the Placement service and leverage those to fix some long-standing architectural issues within Nova. * `Resource provider traits`_: This allows modeling of qualitative information about resource providers. For example, in Ocata we know quantitative information about a resource provider, such as how much DISK_GB inventory it has. Traits allow the system to model the type of disk, e.g. HDD or SDD. Traits will also be used to model resource provider aggregate relationships for things like shared storage pools. * `Custom resource classes`_: This is continuing work from Ocata to have the Ironic compute driver provide Ironic node resource class information to the placement service which will eventually be used for scheduling decisions. * `Claim resources during scheduling`_: This is a refactor to move resource claims out of the compute service ResourceTracker and into the controller service(s) during scheduling which should drastically reduce build retries due to resource contention in a pack-oriented scheduling configuration. This is also needed to avoid 'up-calls' from computes to controller services in a multi-cell deployment. * `Handle aggregate resources`_: This is continuing work from Ocata where we need to be able to model resource provider aggregates for things like shared storage and IP allocation pools. Then the resource tracker in the compute nodes can pull this information from the placement service when a request is made for shared storage in a compute node within a particular aggregate. The allocation claim is then made on the resource provider rather than the compute node. .. _Resource provider traits: ../specs/pike/approved/resource-provider-traits.html .. _Custom resource classes: ../specs/ocata/implemented/custom-resource-classes.html .. _Claim resources during scheduling: ../specs/pike/approved/placement-claims.html .. _Handle aggregate resources: ../specs/newton/implemented/generic-resource-pools.html Integrate Cinder 3.27 --------------------- In Ocata, Cinder provided the `3.27 microversion`_. In Pike, Nova will use the 3.27 API to `attach and detach volumes`_. This is an effort to reduce technical debt and state management between both the Nova and Cinder projects by abstracting volume attachment state information in Cinder where it belongs. This is also a pre-requisite to support attaching multiple instances to the same volume, which will likely be a priority in a future release. .. _3.27 microversion: https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/cinder-specs/specs/ocata/add-new-attach-apis.html .. _attach and detach volumes: ../specs/pike/approved/cinder-new-attach-apis.html Run API under WSGi (Community Goal) ----------------------------------- This is a community-wide release goal for Pike.

When an unprivileged user want to access to Gnocchi resources
created by Ceilometer, that doesn't work because the filter scope
the Gnocchi query to resource owner to the user. To fix we introduce
a new configuration option ""gnocchi_external_project_owner"" set by

resources:
* owned by the user project

This outlines the foundation for a centralized logging platform
for OpenStack-Helm. The foundation includes charts for fluentd,
elasticsearch, and kibana to provide visualization on indices
created on events logged to stdout/stderr from the openstack and
infrastructure services and collected via fluentd.

The goal is to gain feedback and consensus on the path forward
for these services

This makes it difficult to identify operational issues with the platform in a timely and unified manner. Proposed change =============== Utilize fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana to consume, index, and visualize the events logged by the OpenStack services and the infrastructure components of OpenStack-Helm. Fluentd allows for the capture of these events logged to stdout and stderr, applies additional metadata to the events, indexes the data into Elasticsearch, and Kibana provides visualization on the data indexed in Elasticsearch. This proposed change is representative of the approach used by other applications running in Kubernetes. Security impact --------------- Elasticsearch does not provide authentication out of the box without a paid license for Shield or Xpack. There are free Elasticsearch plugins that provide basic authentication functionality, but would require additional work to enable them. Lack of authentication or the limiting of access to Elasticsearch does provide visbility into sensitive information, and it could expose the Elasticsearch cluster to tampering and other malicious behavior. Performance Impact ------------------ OpenStack-Helm's overall performance should not be impacted. The currently supported services already log to stdout and stderr, and Elasticsearch will be responsible for storing and indexing the data consumed. Some performance issues have been reported when Elasticsearch has PVCs backed by Ceph, so profiling the performance with Ceph-backed PVCs should be considered. Alternatives ------------ The primary alternatives would be Logstash in place of fluentd, other timeseries databases, or Monasca in the OpenStack namespace. The proposed approach is preferred due to fluentd's flexibility in consuming logs from multiple sources with varying formats, the ability to tag certain logged events with additional metadata, and the wide range of plugins available from the fluentd community. Elasticsearch provides a highly available storage cluster for storing events, which allows for quick indexing and searching of the information provided by the targeted services. Elasticsearch also offers a flexible logging mechanism for log rotation and handling. Kibana offers a clean visualization platform that integrates with Elasticsearch. Other visualization tools like Grafana could be used as alternatives, but the native integration between Elasticsearch and Kibana makes it a good fit. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: srwilker Work Items ---------- The following charts are required and should align with the design choices present in Openstack-Helm 1. Fluentd 2. Elasticsearch 3. Kibana Sensible default configuration values need to also be identified for the charts listed above. 1. Fluentd inputs and filters broken out appropriately 2. Elasticsearch configured in a stateful, highly available manner 3. Implement alternatives for Elasticsearch authentication shortcomings 4. Appropriate Kibana defaults identified Testing ======= Testing should be achieved through Helm tests included in the charts. These should inclide: 1. Fluentd configuration valid 2. Fluentd queries Elasticsearch to verify data indexed appropriately 3. Elasticsearch can insert, index, and retrieve supplied data appropriately Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation needs to outline the components of the logging framework and how the OpenStack-Helm services are configured to supply the logging platform with any output required to function. The default values for these services should also target appropriate defaults for getting meaningful information from the logging platform. References ========== 1. Fluentd_ 2. Elasticsearch_ 3.

With the demise of OSIC the openstack-ansible
integrated build is now being done more often
on much slower nodepool providers.

Also, recent work to implement rolling upgrades
have changed the way the initial deployment is
done and made it slower than before.

Unfortunately these two elements are now putting
us in the position where we're failing due to
a timeout more often than not, which is stalling
development.

This patch therefore increases the timeout by
30 mins.

* adds new attribute 'flavor_id' for vpnservice
* adds support for multiple drivers for VPNaaS

This solution uses a flavor of service type VPN associated with a flavor
profile containing a driver. During vpnservice creation, if a flavor_id
is passed, it is used to find the provider for the driver which would
handle the newly created vpnservice.  The flavor_id and the
provider-vpnservice association are pesisted in the DB.

ApiImpact and DocImpact tags are added as the new optional flavor_id
parameter should be described, as well as the support of multiple VPNaaS
drivers.

type framework can be found in the following change:
