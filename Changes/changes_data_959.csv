Problem description =============== Currently, Tacker only supports some simple tools such as Ping driver and HTTP ping driver. In this spec, we propose a new monitoring driver which is implemented in Tacker. Particularly, our monitoring driver has the ability to get alarms related to hardware resources such as CPU usage or memory usage. The support of this monitoring driver is necessary for VNF management because of following reasons: * The behavior of VNF instance tightly depends on NFV infrastructure. Actually, VNF instance is designed to run inside a virtual machine (VM). When VM is broken by hardware failure, VNF cannot work well. Currently, in order to detect hardware failure, alarm configuration related to CPU usage and memory usage could be created by Heat in terms of Heat auto-scaling. However, a user of NFV could hardly change alarm parameters like threshold, period and actions. * Another goal is to support high availability for Service Function Chain (SFC). Some fault VNFs detected by the monitoring driver can belong to several chains, therefore ensuring high availability for SFC should be considered. Service Function Chaining management has been approved by Tacker, but no mechanism is used to support high availability for SFC. * Currently, Tacker deploys VNFs on a single OpenStack site. Recently, supporting multisite VIM has been taken into consideration and therefore Tacker also has the ability to support VNF management on multiple OpenStack sites. This implies that a monitoring driver in Tacker should be supported to the multisite scenario. It is feasible to deploy our monitoring driver in multisite scenario because our proposal is to get alarm triggered from Ceilometer. Actually, each site always has an OpenStack Ceilometer. Proposal change =============== As discussed earlier, alarm-based monitoring driver implemented in OpenStack Tacker can monitor instances by using alarms from OpenStack Ceilometer. The main focus in this spec is on Tacker, Ceilometer and the combination between them as described in Figure 1. Ceilometer encompasses three main components: API service, computer agent, and alarm evaluator. As described in Figure 2, API service provides the API so that other OpenStack projects can use to access into database. Computer agent is responsible monitoring instances and collecting data. Based on collected data, alarm evaluator will raise the alarm and trigger it to target projects.

See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License. =========== Event alarm =========== Aodh allows users to define alarms which can be evaluated based on events passed from other OpenStack services. The events can be emitted when the resources from other OpenStack services have been updated, created or deleted, such as 'compute.instance.reboot.end', 'scheduler.select_destinations.end'. When creating a alarm with type of ""event"", a event_type can be specified to identify which type of event occur will trigger the alarm, the event_type field support fuzzy matching with wildcard. Additionally, users can also specify query conditions to filter specific events used to trigger the alarm. This feature was implemented with proposal event-alarm_. .. _event-alarm: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/event-alarm-evaluator Usage ===== When creating a alarm of ""event"" type, the ""event_rule"" need to be specified, which includes a ""event_type"" field and a ""query"" field, the ""event_type"" allow users to specify a specific event type used to match the incoming events when evaluating alarm, and the ""query"" field includes a list of query conditions used to filter specific events when evaluating the alarm. The following is an example of event alarm rule:: ""event_rule"": { ""event_type"": ""compute.instance.update"", ""query"" : [ { ""field"" : ""traits.instance_id"", ""type"" : ""string"", ""value"" : ""153462d0-a9b8-4b5b-8175-9e4b05e9b856"", ""op"" : ""eq"", }, { ""field"" : ""traits.state"", ""type"" : ""string"", ""value"" : ""error"", ""op"" : ""eq"", }, ] } Configuration ============= To enable this functionality, you need to config the Ceilometer can publish events to the queue the aodh-listener service listen on. the *event_alarm_topic* config option of Aodh identify which messaging topic the aodh-listener on, the default value is ""alarm.all"". In Ceilometer side you need to config a notifier as a publisher in the event pipeline config file(event_pipeline.yaml as default), the notifier should be with a messaging topic same as the *event_alarm_topic* option defined. For an example:: --- sources: - name: event_source events: - ""*"" sinks: - event_sink sinks: - name: event_sink transformers: publishers: - notifier:// - notifier://?topic=alarm.all ",,86,0

The fipnamespace is associated with an external network
on a given node. In the case of DVR there is just one
single FIP namespace for a given node.

We have seen some race conditions in the agent for creation
and deletion of the fip namespace. See the bug report for
details on the failure.

So in order to address this race condition and make the
code more stable, we will be cleaning up the fip namespace
only when an external network is removed.

The server will be sending a rpc notification message to
the agent to cleanup the fip namespace when the external
net is removed.

This patch address the above mentioned issue by not constantly
deleting and creating the fip namespace.

we are adding only note to docs about that. Bug should be fixed when
Neutron will support microversioning.

Companies may have VPN, and in China, there is a firewall named
G.F.W., they both may block some protocols or ports, so if I run
autohelp-wrapper, it will fail like this:

Now we have -g option, which can set GITPROJ, but GITBASE still
use git://git.openstack.org/openstack, so it still fail:

Here I proposal to use environment variable value for GITPROJ and
GITBASE if they exist, so some devs, like me, can get rid of
hacking autohelp-wrapper to work then restore it when commit.

Manage existing volume that requires a migration in VNX raises error in
VNX driver.

The root cause is that VNX uses a function to retrieve volume type from
provider location.  When provider location is not initialized (such as a
new LUN), it will send `None` to the VNX driver and driver didn't handle
it well.

Add condition check for this function to return `None` if `None` is
received.

Currently the VMDK driver fails to connect to vCenter server
if vCenter is configured to listen to any port other than the
default port 443. This patch fixes it by adding support for a
new config option 'vmware_host_port' which specifies the port
number to connect to vCenter server.

DocImpact
  Added config option 'vmware_host_port' which specifies the
  port number to connect to vCenter server.

ports

vhost-user is a userspace protocol to establish connectivity
between a virto-net frontend typically qemu and a
userspace virtio backend such as ovs with dpdk.

vhost-user interfaces exist only in userspace from the host perspective
and are not represented in the linux networking stack as kernel netdevs.
As a result attempting to set the mtu on a vhost-user interface
using ifconfig or ip link will fail with a device not found error.

- this change removes a call to _set_device_mtu when plugging
  vhost-user interfaces.
- this change prevents the device not found error from occurring
  which stopped vms booting with vhost-user interfaces
  due to an uncaught exception resulting in a failure to set the
  interface type in ovs.
- this change make creating vhost-user interface
  an atomic action.

This latent bug is only triggered when the mtu value is set to a
value other than 0 which was the default proir to mitaka.

A user should be able to boot a server, resize it and
then reject the resize even though the original flavor
used to boot the instance is deleted. This is because
the old flavor information is stored with the instance
in the nova database, so the original flavor doesn't
actually need to exist anymore.

This commit updates os_nova to use tempest for functional testing of
nova.  For this to work on openstack-infra instances we have to drop
all existing iptables rules using iptables-clear.sh.  This commit also
updates the netmask used across containers as we currently have a mix
of /22 and /24.

Note that I couldn't get the vxlan traffic to work over
10.100.100.0/22, so I created br-vxlan and wired separate container
interfaces into that.

Currently all pip install tasks only require the package to be
present. This means that when an environment undergoes a minor
upgrade the package is not upgraded to the same version that
was tested with. This ultimately results in a deployed
environment that does not match the tested environment.

While for the services installed into venvs this is not an
issue, it does affect those which do not use venvs and any
packages which are installed outside of a venv or on top
of a venv.

This patch changes the behaviour to ensure that the install
task will always use the latest available package. In
developer_mode this will mean using the version specified
in upper-constraints, and in an integrated build this will
mean the version which is available in the wheel repo's
folder for the tag.

The decision to migrate is based on such parameters of VM as cpu utilization or used memory. We propose a strategy for Watcher, that allows to determine if there is an overload in a cluster and how it can be fixed. This specification relates to blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/watcher/+spec/watcher-overload-underload The original code implementing this algorithm (not in the context of Watcher) was published here: https://github.com/joker946/nova/commits/drs Use Cases ================ As an administrator (https://factory.b-com.com/www/watcher/doc/watcher/glossary.html#administrator) I can start the action plan with the Standard Deviation goal. This strategy can be configured by using watcher_standard_deviation options. (https://factory.b-com.com/www/watcher/doc/watcher/glossary.html#goal) As a developer I can edit and adapt this strategy (https://factory.b-com.com/www/watcher/doc/watcher/glossary.html#strategy) for the cluster (https://factory.b-com.com/www/watcher/doc/watcher/glossary.html#cluster) changes. As an end user I'm not affected by this change and won't notice any difference. Project Priority ================ Not relevant because Watcher is not in the big tent so far. =============== Proposed change =============== The new Standard Deviation Strategy allows to determine if there is an overload in a cluster and respond to it by migrating VMs to stabilize the cluster. Input: It is possible to get information about workload of every VM using Ceilometer. In order to do that the means of CPU and RAM utilization for the last 2 minutes are used (configurable). Then the hypervisor workload of each node can be calculated by summing up workload of all VMs on each node. Knowing total amount of CPU and RAM on every node allows to normalise CPU and RAM load. After that the means of CPU and RAM loads for the cluster are calculated. All this information makes it possible to calculate the standard deviation of CPU or RAM. So, we get values (0 < x < 1) and the strategy compares them to cpu_threshold and ram_threshold (these are taken from watcher configuration file). If one of the values is greater than the threshold value, the strategy makes a decision about whether the cluster needs to be stabilized. Cluster stabilization process: For each active VM we simulate migration to another node of the cluster by moving workload of that VM from the source node to a possible destination node. After that the load values of nodes are normalised and the new standard deviation is calculated with them. The total standard deviation is calculated as cpu_weight*cpu_sd + ram_weight*ram_sd, where: * cpu_weight is the weight of cpu_sd value. * cpu_sd is a simulated deviation of cpu value from mean value for the cluster. * ram_weight is the weight of ram_sd value. * ram_sd is a simulated deviation of ram value from mean value for the cluster. From all options of moving VM to other nodes we choose the one that minimizes the standard deviation in a cluster best. That option is added to the map of migration options, that afterwards gets sorted by standard deviation in ascending order. From the resulting list we iteratively take a host/vm pair and place it into solution with action “MIGRATION”. We compare the resulting deviations of CPU and RAM to the threshold values. If the resulting deviations are less than the threshold values, the cycle stops and the resulting strategy is sent to Watcher Applier. Alternatives ============ The alternatives to this approach are to use different Goals and associated Strategies defined in Watcher. Data model impact ================= None expected. REST API impact =============== There is no impact on the REST API. Security impact =============== None expected. Notifications impact ==================== No specific notifications associated with executing a specific Strategy are envisaged. (Notifications could arise from the resulting actions, but these are presumably handled in other parts of Watcher). Other end user impact ===================== This capability will not have any specific impact on the API. It will have a small impact in how it is used via the python-watcherclient as a new option will now be available for goal parameter in an Audit Template. Performance Impact ================== No specific performance impact is expected. Other deployer impact ===================== No specific deployer impact is envisaged. Developer impact ================ This will not impact other developers working on OpenStack. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) =========== Primary assignee: Alexander Chadin <alexchadin> Other contributors: Alexander Stavitskiy <alexstav> Work Items ========== This task can be considered atomic. It just requires the development and test of a single class. ============ Dependencies ============ No dependencies. ======= Testing ======= Several unit tests will be provided to test various scenarios using a fake mock models. ==================== Documentation Impact ==================== It will be necessary to add new content relating to this new Goal and Strategy to the documentation. ========== References ========== No references. ======= History ======= No history.",,176,0

The existing openrc file download only works for keystone v2. Regardless
of whether v3 is enabled in Horizon.

This adds support for both. A v2.0 and a v3 compatible openrc file
download. A couple of different situations are covered.

1) support for keystone v2 only: OPENSTACK_API_VERSION={'identity': 2.0}
In this case only the v2 option is shown.

2) Use of keystone v3 in a potentially mixed environment. Since it is
possible to use keystone v2 and v3 in the same enviroment, having
OPENSTACK_API_VERSION={'identity': 3} displays options for downloading
v2 or v3 compatible openrc files.

Rationale for making the existing methods and urls support v3+. By
moving the v2.0 functionality to new version specific methods, they can
be more easily excised when v2 is obsolete and we're left with the newer
version support.

Problem description =================== As Docker is supported by OpenStack, but containers' metrics are not available by Ceilometer. This blueprint will be useful to retrieve containers' metrics, it also help to support Heat and alarm and related usecases such as Autoscaling. Proposed change =============== As containers' stats are available by Docker API, let's achieve a Docker inspector to retrieve containers' stats by Dcoker API, then calculate metrics such as CPU, Disk, Memory, Network, these metrics data will be available to Ceilometer. Alternatives ------------ There was similar blueprint proposal ""Develop plug-in to monitor containers"", but the approach is different. The old proposal depended on cAdvisor (https://github.com/google/cadvisor) to get resource metrics, that means every compute node would install advisor additionally to monitor containers located at the node. Actually we can directly use Docker API to retrieve resource metrics, it'll be more simple.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================== Ceilometer Collection Agents Split ================================== There are several benefits of separating Ceilometer in different repositories: * separate Ceilometer functionalities in different packages that can be deployed independently. * make code smaller and easier to understand and maintain. * reduce barrier for new developers and foster more focused communities. This proposal aims to separate the Ceilometer collection agents. These agents are responsible of collecting samples and notifications from the various services running in OpenStack. A general diagram of the current architecture and the long term vision of the separate constituencies can be found here: http://www.slideshare.net/FabioGiannetti/ceilo-componentization-diagrams This new package is comprised of the following two main agents: * Notification Agent. This agent collects messages published in the ""Oslo"" bus and re-publishes them as samples/meters and/or events. * Central/Compute Agent. This agent(s) polls data from the requested sources at a given interval. It also coordinates across all the pollster to load-balance work. The Compute agent is specialized in polling data from Nova APIs. Problem description =================== Ceilometer is performing several functions as a single service and agents. These functions can be inter-connected and leveraged but are quite different in nature and this constitutes a maintenance and deployment probably, especially in environment where Ceilomter is only used for a single task. There are already evidence of deployments where Ceilometer is used for autoscaling with short lived data mostly collected from the ""polling"" agents and another instance that is using mostly notifications and have a long data storage for billing needs. Having the ability of splitting the components in such a way that you can deploy only the part that is relevant to your businees is a clear advantage. There is another spec that for instance is addressing the split of the alarm capabilities for the autoscaling needs: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/184307/ Proposed change =============== The proposed change is to create a dedicated Openstack package called ""ceilometer-collection"" or equivalent that contains only the agents responsbile of retrieving data from the Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service components of the OpenStack ecosystem. Alternatives ------------ There aren't other alternatives to this than leave the current repo untouched. Data model impact ----------------- None. The agents are not storing any data but only re-formatting it and re-publish it in the queue(s). REST API impact --------------- None. Agents are API-less. Security impact --------------- There is a security improvement since less credentials needs to be added in the configuration files. If only agents are deployed there is no need to provide credentials for Databases. Pipeline impact --------------- None. The pipeline will be the same as it currently is. Other end user impact --------------------- Maintainability and Upgrades should be easier to manage since now it is possible to pull changes for only the repos that are relevant and upgrades can be performed for the different components independently and at different times. Performance/Scalability Impacts ------------------------------- Performance and Scalabilty are the same as before. Other deployer impact --------------------- There is a big advantage in potentially simplifying the deployment if not the entire Ceilometer capabilities are not required, Developer impact ---------------- Developers have now a smaller repo to navigate and work on, which should help them navigate the code and be more effective in contributing. This also should lower the barrier for new developers to contribute. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: rohit-jaswail, fabgia Other contributors: TBD Ongoing maintainer: rohit-jaswail Work Items ---------- The code needs to be copied over to a new repository in Openstack, that is now part of the Ceilometer components. i.e. Ceilometer-Collection. A new gate job for this package needs to be created so then the test can run against the agents. Future lifecycle ================ The lifecycle of this code is similar to what it was before. Dependencies ============ * Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints under the Telemetry program, or in other programs, that the current blueprint one either depends on or is related to. * If this requires functionality of another program that is not currently used by Telemetry (such as a new or extended library provided by the Oslo program), document that fact. * Does this feature require any new external dependencies or code otherwise not included in OpenStack? Or does it depend on a specific version of library? Is this library already packaged for the major distros (i.e. derivatives of Debian and Fedora). Testing ======= There should be no difference in the unit testing that was done before. Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation need to be re-visited stating the new packages that need to be download and installed now as separated parts. This should also make the documentation easier to understand and maintain since it is more focussed on the specific component rather than the overall solution.

SNIMissingWarning was introduced in urllib3 in 1.13.

When using rally with an older version of urllib3 (f.e. as used in
liberty, urllib3>=1.8.3), the SNIMissingWarning may be not present, in
which case the code will crash with AttributeError.

So first check whether the warning is known to the urllib3 library being
used with rally before trying to disable it.

accidental schema changes involving external tables. After a few cycles
now, it is very unlikely that human error will not be spotted during
code review, where external tables are referenced/modified during Neutron
core schema migrations.

Putting effort into fixing the BGP removal corner case is not worth it,

Dead loop scenario:
1. assume we have threhold alarm C, D
2. then we create combination alarm A with alarm_ids = C, D
3. and we create combination alarm B with alarm_ids = A
4. then we update alarm A with alarm_ids = B
5. then when evaluator alarm state, the two combination alarms have circle
   dependency, and will never be evaluated properly.

We should avoid such scenario

The basic idea is the following:
* all threshold alarms are good alarms, which definitely have no dependency,
  so there is no circle dependency
* all alarms depending only on good alarms are good alarms

Only if the updated alarm triggers circle dependency, we deny such request,
otherwise we allow such request, this aims at providing a chance for user
to resolve circle dependency after upgrade.

Currently, instance net related metrics has resource id which
is composite of 'instance_name-instance_id-vnic_name'. However,
instance name is user oriented, and it is a bit redundant to
instance id (we can get instance name by query that instance id),
the worst problem is that, *instance name can be changed*, which will
cause ceilometer think that are two different resources. VNIC's
name can be changed too, but we can think that case means VNIC
 is removed, instance can not treat as been removed because id is
same, and VNIC name is the only option if there is no such VNIC id
can be provided.

So this patch removes instance name from resource id in net pollsters,
and adds instance name to resource_metadata.

This patch adds an alternative for multiple notification agents
support. By default, we still use Rabbit IPC queues, but if
Rabbit cannot be used (usually, it is overloaded), it would
be great if we suggest other options.

Also, this patch adds transformer_id. It's basically sink+transformer
names concatination. So, several agents may deal with one pipe.

This patch version adds Redis-based implementation for hangling
of out of order samples. Currently we just drop all ooo samples,
but this cannot be a solution for coordinated mode and high load.
So, in this patch I use Redis' sorted sets to have all samples
sorted automatically.
This patch version contains changes for Delta transformer. But all
changes should be abstract enough to apply them at least to
RateOfChange transformers as well.

Note, that all unit tests pass successfully with redis except one:
out_of_order case. It's ok, because with the Redis cache we handle
ooo carefully and got more data from transformer then it is expected
in the test

This patch adds a serial console proxy. This will be used in order
to expose VM serial ports via TCP sockets.

The named pipe IO workers run in native threads and the serial
proxy uses queues to interact with those workers. For this reason,
the serial proxy will use native threads as well.

This implies that logging cannot be used.

Just as the serial console specification states, only one client
can be connected at a time.

There was some confusion/debate in reviewing
I5fa1fdba56803b2ef63b1efaaeeced6ceb7779d9 and whether or
not it required a microversion to change the response code.

This was a pretty common sense scenario where 415 was a
more appropriate error code for 400 and is a better client
experience when hitting that error.

This change updates the potentially confusing part of the
devref about this and adds a note to ask the Nova API
subteam when in doubt about whether or not a microversion
is needed for changing error codes.

This adds the auto-allocated-topology validation into
the neutron validate_networks path, which is called from
the compute API when creating instances.

If there are no available networks for the project and the
user specifically requested that a network be automatically
allocated for them (via the 'auto' network id on the request),
then we have to check that:

1. The auto-allocated-topology extension is available in neutron.
2. The dry-run validation for auto-allocated-topology passes.

Otherwise we fail the request with a 400 error. Since the

it in the REST API.

Currently, if NVRAM deletion fails, an exception is raised and causes
a failure. If we fail to remove the entry from swift, the worst case
scenario is if the data is really in swift, it sticks around and
never gets cleaned out. Instead, if NVRAM deletion fails, we should
log a warning message.

Currently openstack.session.parse_url[1] doesn't handle correctly
endpoint with a non-empty relative path not containing the version.
Typically it transforms the neutron endpoint:

  http://example.com/network

into:

  http://example.com/v2.0

when it should transform it into:

  http://example.com/network/v2.0

This change corrects parse_url in order to support such case.

Overriding service_provider was an hack and should not exist in any
module.
Puppet is by itself able to find which Service provider to use.
If you want to override it for any reason, please use a Puppet resource
collector, using keystone-service resource tag.

This patch deprecates the service_provider parameter and drop its usage,
so puppet-keystone can easily work on more systems, (ie: Ubuntu Xenial
with Systemd).

Extended the use of the DatabaseBroker ""stale_reads_ok"" flag to the
AccountBroker and ContainerBroker.  Now checks for an sqlite3 error
from the _commit_puts call that processes the pending files.

If this error is raised, then the stale_reads_ok flag will be checked
to determine how to proceed as opposed to simply raising.

The first time that print_info is attempted, the flag will be
false, but swift-[account|container]-info will check for the
raised exception.  If it was raised, then a warning is reported
that the data may be stale, and another attempt will be
made using the stale_reads_ok=True flag.

Problem description =================== nova-api returns hypervisor's cpu_info in string, instead of regular JSON-object: :: { ""hypervisor"": { ""status"":""enabled"", ""service"":{ ""host"":""host1"", ""disabled_reason"":null, ""id"":5 }, ""vcpus_used"":1, ""hypervisor_type"":""QEMU"", ""local_gb_used"":0, ""vcpus"":1, ""hypervisor_hostname"":""host1"", ""memory_mb_used"":576, ""memory_mb"":3010, ""current_workload"":0, ""state"":""up"", ""host_ip"":""192.168.122.121"", ""cpu_info"":""{\""vendor\"": \""Intel\"", \""model\"": \""cpu64-rhel6\"", \""arch\"": \""x86_64\"", \""features\"": [\""pge\"", \""clflush\"", \""sep\"", \""syscall\"", \""tsc\"", \""vmx\"", \""cmov\"", \""fpu\"", \""pat\"", \""lm\"", \""msr\"", \""nx\"", \""fxsr\"", \""pae\"", \""mmx\"", \""cx8\"", \""mce\"", \""de\"", \""mca\"", \""pse\"", \""pni\"", \""abm\"", \""popcnt\"", \""apic\"", \""sse\"", \""lahf_lm\"", \""sse2\"", \""hypervisor\"", \""cx16\"", \""pse36\"", \""mtrr\"", \""x2apic\""], \""topology\"": {\""cores\"": 1, \""threads\"": 1, \""sockets\"": 1}}"", ""running_vms"":1, ""free_disk_gb"":21, ""hypervisor_version"":2000000, ""disk_available_least"":14, ""local_gb"":21, ""free_ram_mb"":2434, ""id"":1 } } cpu_info is stored in DB as string, and that's OK. But in API such string is unacceptable and should be changed to object. There is completely redundant logic in python-novaclient, which exists only because of cpu_info field. Use Cases ---------- This change helps to improve api, which is used by many modules/systems. also refactoring could help to improve unit-tests quality in nova. Project Priority ----------------- None Proposed change =============== Add logic to deserialize cpu_info field from string to objects.VirtCPUModel after object is loaded from db. Alternatives ------------ As alternative api could provide enum for cpu_info.model, cpu_info.vendor, and cpu_info.features.name. This approach will add new data layer between actual values from hypervisor and values returned with api response. Also addition of new model and vendors into hypervisor causes API bump every time. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- Change in should be added in a new API microversion: `GET /v2.1/os-hypervisors/​{hypervisor_id}​` Show hypervisor details Shows details for a specified hypervisor. Change in response data: :: cpu_info = { 'type': 'object', 'properties': { 'vendor': { 'type': 'string', 'minLength': 1, 'maxLength': 255 }, 'model': { 'type': 'string', 'minLength': 1, 'maxLength': 255 }, 'features': { 'type': 'array', 'items': { 'type': 'string', } }, 'topology': { 'type': 'object', 'properties': { 'cores': { 'type': 'int', 'minimum': 1 }, 'threads': { 'type': 'int', 'minimum': 1 }, 'sockets': { 'type': 'int', 'minimum': 1 } } }, 'arch': { 'type': 'string', 'enum': ['alpha', 'armv6', 'armv7l', 'armv7b', 'aarch64', 'cris', 'i686', 'ia64', 'lm32', 'm68k', 'microblaze', 'microblazeel', 'mips', 'mipsel', 'mips64', 'mips64el', 'openrisc', 'parisc', 'parisc64', 'ppc', 'ppcle', 'ppc64', 'ppc64le', 'ppcemb', 's390', 's390x', 'sh4', 'sh4eb', 'sparc', 'sparc64', 'unicore32', 'x86_64', 'xtensa', 'xtensaeb'] 'minLength': 1, 'maxLength': 255 } }, 'additionalProperties': False } Response example: :: { ""hypervisor"": { ""status"": ""enabled"", ""service"": { ""host"": ""host1"", ""disabled_reason"": null, ""id"": 5 }, ""vcpus_used"": 1, ""hypervisor_type"": ""QEMU"", ""local_gb_used"": 0, ""vcpus"": 1, ""hypervisor_hostname"": ""host1"", ""memory_mb_used"": 576, ""memory_mb"": 3010, ""current_workload"": 0, ""state"": ""up"", ""host_ip"": ""192.168.122.121"", ""cpu_info"": { ""vendor"": ""Intel"", ""model"": ""cpu64-rhel6"", ""arch"": ""x86_64"", ""features"": [""sse2"", ""cx16"", ""pse36"", ""mtrr"", ""x2apic""], ""topology"": { ""cores"": 1, ""threads"": 1, ""sockets"": 1 } }, ""running_vms"": 1, ""free_disk_gb"": 21, ""hypervisor_version"": 2000000, ""disk_available_least"": 14, ""local_gb"": 21, ""free_ram_mb"": 2434, ""id"": 1 } } Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other and user impact --------------------- python-novaclient should implement logic to work with new api microversion.

In review of this role it was discovered that we had a duplicate
key within a task. While this is acceptable in Ansible as it will
just use the last key found in a given task it is wrong and should
be removed. In later version of Ansible (2.1.0) a warning is printed

This chage cleans up the role by removing the duplication.

This change adds code that ensures that if package is made public,
all its dependencies (packages and images) are also made public.
It allows to avoid bad user experience for a tenant having access
to a package but not to its dependencies in case of turning
private packages into public.
However, if public dependencies are made private or even deleted,
there's no way to maintain consistency automatically. Such situation
should be handled by importing lacking dependencies manually.
Note that requirements are obtained from packages specifications
from apps.openstack.org, so it's not possible for other packages.

tests introduced in review 266005:

    - add test scenario for: bug 1549600
    - simplify turning off unsupported root-disable tests
      by introducing a single assertion hook that runs before all
      related tests
    - ping the datastore as root to verify it can connect
    - ping after root-disable to verify it cannot connect
    - add missing ping implementations to Cassandra and Redis helpers
    - enable root with password tests on MySQL and related
    - use the same helper method to get root credentials as
      the cluster-root tests
    - also assert the expected root-user-name if specified
    - cleanup auxiliary backup
    - add Postgres root credentials
    - Skip root-cluster test on Redis
    - minor cleanup
    - increased the low guestagent call timeout (helps tests

the existence of doctree, which I think its better.

Managing a share with a share type that has replication_type
extra_spec must be allowed. Drivers are expected to fail
this operation if the share was part of a replication relationship
that Manila does not know about.

Unmanaging a share with replicas must not be permitted
until all replicas are removed.

Managing and unmanaging of snapshots must not
be permitted for a share that has replicas.

Modify the NetApp driver for manage_existing to check
for existing replicas.

Also fix issue with manage retry where the share
data was being altered inappropriately by a DB API.

The HAProxy role configures a ping check that runs against a root
DNS server operated by RIPE. This may not be reachable in certain
deployments and some deployers might not want to ping this external
server repeatedly.

This patch adds documentation for deployers who want to change the
destination for ping checks or the count/frequency of these pings.

On collector, self.sample_listener in stop could raise
AttributeError even it's correctly defined in start()

On notification agent, we workaround this by adding getattr/hasattr.
That complicates the code for no reason.

This change creates a base class that hide the oslo_service weird

The change set of c5fa665de3173f3ad82cc3e7624b5968bc52c08d
introduced a new test TestMl2PortsV2.test_update_port_host_id_changed
which isn't always correct depending on driver.
ML2 driver may change port status to ACTIVE on port binding.
With such driver, the test fails. Grep showed 5 decomposed driver
don't have the assumption.
So this patch makes the test to run only _process_bind_port() without
calling full update_port() so that precommit/postcommit don't get
involved.

Currently l3 agent suppresses exception traceback and just
raises new FloatingIpSetupException so it's impossible to see
actual issue from logs.
The patch adds LOG.exception() to the exception handler before

Currently l3 agent suppresses exception traceback and just
raises new FloatingIpSetupException so it's impossible to see
actual issue from logs.
The patch adds LOG.exception() to the exception handler before
reraising.

It's failing because of a known issue, being handled in:

unskip the test as part of the fix.

Apart from this test, there's also a known failure in LB

I'm not aware of any other failure modes for fullstack.
With these two patches merged, we can observe the fullstack

An initial convergence testing for the role is provided but it is
not installing or configuring ceilometer yet. That work is held back
until we have the role passing basic testing. This stage of testing
also attempts to avoid installing rabbit as an unnecessary
complexity.

A separate container is used for gnocchi so that gnocchi can be
deployed under mod_wsgi without conflicting with Keystone. In turn
some changes to the inventory pattern, and the use of group_vars for
internal and external _lb_vip_address values is introduced here as
there is no load balancer and traffic for each of Keystone and
Gnocchi needs to be addressed appropriately.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== FS Attach / Detach API ========================================== Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/XXX Create new share attach/detach APIs in Nova to manage the connectivity and access to shares created by Manila. Problem description =================== Until recently, OpenStack has had only two storage services providing persistent storage for Nova instances. The first is Swift, OpenStack's object storage offering, which requires simple HTTP to access its storage. The second is Cinder, the block storage service, which requires the hypervisor to access to the allocated storage. For this reason, it is very tightly integrated with Nova, enabling users to easily attach and detach volumes from their instances. Now with Manila, the filesystem-as-a-service offering from OpenStack, users have a third storage model which can provide persistent storage. This relatively new model is not very integrated with Nova, and as shuch, its workflow is not as efficient as Cinder's. Also, by not having Nova participate in the workflow, it complicates the addition of future enhancements in the Manila user model. Use Cases --------- User creates a Manila share with the appropriate permissions. Using the same workflow as Cinder, they would then *attach* the share to one or more Nova instances, enabling them to access the network file system. Proposed change =============== We propose the following changes to Nova: * Client needed to communicate with the Manila service. * State saved in Nova database showing reflecting instance share attach state. * Additional actions to the Nova action endpoint to attach, detach, and list shares associated with specified instances. Alternatives ------------ Continue using the method used today. Data model impact ----------------- The data model will be largely based on the current implementation of how Cinder volume ids are stored. REST API impact --------------- Attach Share ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Enable a Nova instance to access a Manila share. The following Nova action is proposed to the API:: POST /v2.1/​{tenant_id}​/servers/​{server_id}​/action +---------------------+------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | Parameter | Style | Type | Description | +=====================+============+=============+==========================+ | share_attach | plain | xsd:string | The action | +---------------------+------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | share_id | plain | csapi:UUID | The share ID | +---------------------+------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | mount_point(Opt) | plain | xsd:string | The mount point location | +---------------------+------------+-------------+--------------------------+ .. code-block:: json { ""share_attach"": { ""share_id"": ""15e59938-07d5-11e1-90e3-e3dffe0c5983"", ""mount_point"": ""/net/mymount"", } } This operation does not return a response body. When this call is executed, Nova will ensure the instance has access to the share by using Manila *access* endpoint:: POST /v2/​{tenant_id}​/shares/​{share_id}​/action Once this call is successful, Nova will then save the attached *share_id* on the database as it is done for Cinder volumes. List Shares ^^^^^^^^^^^ List shares accessable by the instance. A new JSON value is proposed to the following API:: GET /v2.1/​{tenant_id}​/servers/​{server_id}​ +------------------------+------------+-------------+-----------------------+ | Parameter | Style | Type | Description | +========================+============+=============+=======================+ | os-extended- | plain | csapi:dict | Attached shares, | | shares:shares_attached | | | if any | +------------------------+------------+-------------+-----------------------+ Detach Share storage ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Remove access to a Manila share. The following Nova action is proposed to the API:: POST /v2.1/​{tenant_id}​/servers/​{server_id}​/action +---------------------+------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | Parameter | Style | Type | Description | +=====================+============+=============+==========================+ | share_detach | plain | xsd:string | The action | +---------------------+------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | share_id | plain | csapi:UUID | The share ID | +---------------------+------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | mount_point(Opt) | plain | xsd:string | The mount point location | +---------------------+------------+-------------+--------------------------+ .. code-block:: json { ""share_detach"": { ""share_id"": ""15e59938-07d5-11e1-90e3-e3dffe0c5983"", ""mount_point"": ""/net/mymount"", } } This operation does not return a response body. When this call is executed, Nova will ensure the instance has access to the share removed by using Manila *access* endpoint:: POST /v2/​{tenant_id}​/shares/​{share_id}​/action Once this call is successful, Nova will then save the attached *share_id* on the database as it is done for Cinder volumes. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- Use the same notification service as attaching a Cinder volume. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- * This work is needed for one possible goal of having hypervisor mediated access, instead of our current network mediated security model. * Together with [1] will enable future enhancements which could simplify the filesystem access workflow. * We would like to get feedback not only from the Nova community but also from the Manila community. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: lpabon Work Items ---------- * Create new actions * Create unit tests for actions Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= * Unit tests Documentation Impact ==================== API documentation will need to be updated.

When using neutron-db-manage to upgrade to a milestone tag,
the script was not ensuring that the expand branch was
upgraded before the contract branch. This broke projects
where contract migrations depend on expand migrations.

This commit moves the installation of bind9 to the tests, leaving the
installation/configuration of the desired DNS server to the deployer.
We can eventually use a role to handle the installation/configuration
of bind, but some further research will need to be done to isolate
the best role.

Additionally, this commit adds some very basic tests that validate the
Designate API.  Next steps involve using designate-tempest-plugin to
handle this.

NOTE: No relnote is being added for the removal of bind9 as no valid

Also, when coverage was added to the test requirements file it appeared

To compile some gems, when running Puppet jobs (lint for example), a
package is required: zlib-devel.

It is already installed on Ubuntu, but is not on Red Hat systems.
We did not detect this missing dependency until we added
other-requirements.txt to Puppet modules.

This patch makes sure we install the dependency, so it's
consistent with Ubuntu, and allow us to have other-requirements.txt file
in place for some repo where we don't want bindeps default packages.

The aim is to have durations statistics in task results,
however current database structure does not support this.

This patch adds durations statistics data to task extended
results, which emulates obtaining it from the database.
Once database is improved, its structure will support data
returned by objects.task.Task.extend_results(), so we can
use these emulated result right now.

Also, cli.commands.TaskCommands.detailed() is switched
to usage of this statistics.

HTML report will be switched too in further patch.
This change is also important for upcoming Trends HTML report.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================= Add a BuildRequest object ========================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/add-buildrequest-obj In order to maintain the API contract when using cells we need to store enough information to fulfill an instance show request. Problem description =================== When an API request is made to build an instance there is a certain response contract that we need to honor. This means that we need to have stored certain information from the request such as image, flavor, name, uuid, etc... In a cellsv2 setup this poses a challenge because that would currently be stored in the instance table, but we don't know which cell instance table to put it in yet. Use Cases ---------- * Operators want to partition their deployments into cells for scaling, failure domain, and buildout reasons. When partitioned, we need to maintain the current API contract. Proposed change =============== A new object will be added which will have a RequestSpec object as a field, and all additional details needed for an instance show as other fields. A new table will be added to the api database to store the fields which are not in the RequestSpec. Alternatives ------------ The RequestSpec object could be expanded to hold all of this data. That would bloat an object whose purpose is to inform scheduling decisions with unnecessary data for that task. An instance table could be added to the api database. This is similar to what's being proposed here, but could lead to confusion because of its temporary nature. The BuildRequest object will look much like an instance, but it will be clear that it's not actually *the* instance. Data model impact ----------------- A new table will be added to the 'nova_api' database for storing the BuildRequest fields. The table will need to store things like availability_zone, power_state, task_state, uuid, key_name, metadata, security_groups, etc... These items will be stored as a versioned dict of the fields necessary. The table will look like::: CREATE TABLE `build_request` ( `created_at` datetime DEFAULT NULL, `updated_at` datetime DEFAULT NULL, `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `instance_uuid` varchar(36) NOT NULL, `project_id` varchar(255) NOT NULL, `request_obj` text NOT NULL ) instance_uuid and project_id would be indexed. Once the instance has been written to a cell database this entry should be deleted as the show request can then be fulfilled from the instance table. This means that this data is short lived so future changes can be made with few concerns about backwards compatibility. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ An additional database write will be incurred. Other deployer impact --------------------- Instances that have not been scheduled yet will exist in this new table. Deployers will need to be aware of this to aid proper debugging. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: alaski Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Have nova-api write BuildRequest info to this table * Have nova-api respond to list/show requests with the BuildRequest object if the instance has not yet been mapped to a cell. * After the instance has been created in the cell database (covered in the scheduler interaction spec) remove this database row. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Since this is designed to be an internal re-architecting of Nova with no user visible changes the current suite of Tempest or functional tests should suffice. At some point we will want to look at how to test multiple cells or potentially exposing the concept of a cell in the API and we will tackle testing requirements then. Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation will be written describing the flow of an instance build and how this affects it.

Compute microversion v2.20 allows the volume attachment operations

This commit adds tests for that behavior and verify the attaching and detaching

NOTE- In addition to tests, this also does some schema versioning.
Tempest strictly validate the response and does not allow additional elements

As v2.20 microversion request will respond as latest behavior of Nova till V2.20,
response schema needs to be version for older microversion if response is changed in between.

are supposed to rely on devstack pip_install() function to apply

devstack-gate job type but still trigger tests through tox, we should

The venv environment is used by infra scripts to build tarballs and
documents and during translations.

The current install script uses zuul-cloner and that breaks the
translation sync, see
http://logs.openstack.org/periodic/trove-dashboard-propose-translation-update/e1aeeee

There's no need to install horizon here, use a normal install command.

This patch adds the copying of release notes as part of the role
requirements update process.

This ensures that when the role SHA's are updated, all new
release notes from that SHA are included and published with
the appropriate integrated release tag.

If ipxe fails to boot download kernel/initrd, it will give up and the
boot process will continue with the next boot device, and may end up
with a boot on the old disk image.

If ipxe has failed to download a file and after the pxe/ipxe_timeout
delay, it will now retry to download it instead of giving up.

This goto/retry pattern is common with IPXE. This is an example:
  http://ipxe.org/cmd/autoboot

We can hardly implement complex solutions since we have a very limited
control over the ipxe version in use.

Major release ------------- Major release is cut off once per development cycle and has an assigned name (Liberty, Mitaka, ...) Prior to major release, #. consider blocking all patches that are not targeted for the new release; #. revise the current list of blueprints and bugs targeted for the release; drop anything that does not fit there, or won't make it; #. start collecting state for targeted features from the team. For example, propose a postmortem patch for neutron-specs as in: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/286413/ The following steps should be taken before claiming a successful major release: #. the latest alembic scripts are tagged with a milestone label. For example, see: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/288212/ #. a new stable branch is created; #. a patch for openstack/releases repo is proposed and merged. In the new stable branch, you should: #. update .gitreview file to point to the new branch; #. if the branch uses constraints to manage gated dependency versions, update the default constraints file name to point to corresponding stable branch in openstack/requirements repo; #. if the branch fetches any other projects as dependencies, f.e. by using tox_install.sh as an install_command in tox.ini, update the git repository links to point to corresponding stable branches of those dependency projects. In the opened master branch, you should: #. update CURRENT_RELEASE in neutron.db.migration.cli to point to the next release name. Minor release ------------- Minor release is a release created from existing stable branch after the initial major release, and that usually contains bug fixes and small improvements only. The following steps should be taken before claiming a successful minor release: #. a patch for openstack/releases repo is proposed and merged. ",,57,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============== Add a CellZero ============== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/cells-cell0 In order to maintain the API contract when using cells we need to store enough information to fulfill an instance show request even when the instance could not be scheduled to a cell. Problem description =================== When an API request is made to build an instance there is a certain response contract that we need to honor. This means that we need to have stored certain information from the request such as image, flavor, name, uuid, etc... Under ideal circumstances the instance will have been scheduled to a host in a cell and the data will be in that cells database. In the event that no cell/host can hold the instance that data needs to be stored outside of any live cells. Use Cases ---------- * Operators want to partition their deployments into cells for scaling, failure domain, and buildout reasons. When partitioned, we need to maintain the current API contract. Proposed change =============== A cell0 will be added which consists of the database tables needed by an instance within a live cell. Instances, and necessary relations, can be stored here and included in API responses. The only available action for instances within this cell will be to delete them as they are in an error state. Instances that are stored here will have a regular instance_mapping set so that requests for those instances can follow the normal code path. The boot process for instances will be updated to create instances in cell0 when the scheduler fails to pick a location for the instance. Alternatives ------------ An alternative would be to store the instance records, and relations, within the nova api database in a serialized format for easy retrieval for API responses. This was dismissed because it would require multiple upgrade paths when making changes to the instance table schema or related schemas. Another alternative would be to maintain an instance table and related tables in the nova api database. This is very similar to what's being proposed however having a cell0 construct is beneficial to avoid special casing lookups/deletes for instances here. They will have a normal instance_mapping set so operations will find them normally. Data model impact ----------------- All database tables necessary for storing an instance and related objects, like security_groups or instance_extra, will be created and managed for this new cell. For now it would be best to just deploy a normal cell database for cell0 though it will contain unnecessary tables such as compute_nodes. Later work can trim this down if it's deemed worthwhile. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- Instances that were not schedulable will exist in this special cell. Deployers will need to be aware of this to aid proper debugging. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: alaski Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Devstack changes to setup a cell0. * Add logic to create instances in cell0 when they can not be scheduled. * Document deployment instructions for cell0. Dependencies ============ * Spec to call the scheduler earlier in the boot process https://review.openstack.org/#/c/239995/ Testing ======= Since this is designed to be an internal re-architecting of Nova with no user visible changes the current suite of Tempest or functional tests should suffice. At some point we will want to look at how to test multiple cells or potentially exposing the concept of a cell in the API and we will tackle testing requirements then. Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation will be written describing the flow of an instance build and how this affects it.

and couple of patches in Glance_Store [2,3]. The main goal is using
separate section (file with such section) for providing credentials
for access to Swift and do not place reference with credentials to
database.

All changes above are covered in docs for configuring Swift backend [4].

Also glance_cache_config now is not using for configuring Swift backend,
hence all related parameters for this config removed.

This commit makes the following changes to install/ubuntu-dev.rst:

- removes copying of all *.sample files since we end up overwriting
  contents of several files anyway
- removes a number of inline comments to give clear separation between
  information and commands
- adds a simple pools.yaml sample which should work out of the box on
  most development deploys
    - this file uses a name of ""default"", which means it will not
      create a new pool but rather use the existing one (helpful as
      designate.conf already references the existing pool's ID)
    - uses a target of type ""bind9"", which matches the
      backend in designate.conf
    - uses an rncd_key_file that exists in /etc/bind
- adds the necessary section on how to import it into Designate
- adds some additional information about activating virtualenv before
  attempting to start services in the virtualenv
- prefixes any command that requires root privileges with ""sudo""
- updates examples/basic-config-sample.conf by removing reference to
  defunct 'Pool Configuration' section

Please note that I am inexperienced with Designate so some of my
assumptions here may be incorrect.

But it still overlaps the input label and warning tooltip.
This commit fixed this by hiding the input with display:none.

Problem description =================== When nova use neutron network-api, it will check neutron port quota in nova-api if we boot a instance with parameter network-id, in large-scale, if a tenant already has a large number instances, booting a instance needs much time to check port quota through neutron API, sometimes the REST api will timeout and fail to create instance. For this problem, there are two primary causes: * from nova side, it checks port quota in nova-api and creates port in nova-compute, the reason is that ""Ideally Nova would create all required ports as part ofnetwork validation, but port creation requires some details from the hypervisor. So we just check the quota and return how many of the requested number of instances can be created"". In some case, there is a problem: during booting a instanc, neutron port quota meets requirement in nova-api, but after nova-schedule, it creates port in nova-compute, neutron already does not meet requirement. * from neutron side, it does not provide reservation mechanism, if nova want to check the rest of port number for this tenant, nova must use neutron quota-show to get port quota, and use port-list to get already create port numbers, and then get the rest number, in large-scale, port-list will consume much time. Use Cases ---------- None Project Priority ----------------- None Proposed change =============== To improve performance and make consistent API for nova booting instance API, this proposal will remove neutron port quota check in nova-api, just let nova-compute to check it, if port quota does not meet requirement in nova-compute, it fail to boot instanc. Alternatives ------------ When nova check port quota in nova-api, it should first check the quota, if the quota getting from neutron is -1, there is no need to get the already created ports number. But this improvement just for neutron not limit port quota. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- nova does not raise exception PortLimitExceeded in boot instance API. Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ booting instance would be significantly faster in large-scale. Other end user impact --------------------- None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: shihanzhang Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- None Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= remove the exiting unit tests for checking port quota in nova-api.

The CLEANWAIT state was introduced in Liberty
(Ic2bc4f147f68947f53d341fda5e0c8d7b594a553) to distinguish
between nodes that were CLEANING versus CLEANWAIT. Now
that it is Newton, all nodes that might have been in CLEANING
state (instead of CLEANWAIT) should have been cleaned (unless
the cleaning is taking many months to finish), so there shouldn't
be any nodes that aren't in the expected CLEANWAIT state.

This removes the backwards compatibility code that had been
introduced to handle nodes that might have been in CLEANING
instead of CLEANWAIT state.

This patchset fixes the problem by which we did not provide any
default state upon creating an Audit. An API validation in now in
place to validate the JSON data sent to create an Audit:

- 'audit_template_uuid' is required and should be a UUID
- 'state' is readonly so it raises an error if submitted in POST
  and is set by default to PENDING
- 'uuid' is optional and is now generated if not provided
- 'deadline' is optional and should be a datetime
- 'type' is a required text field

Problem description: =============== Currently, Tacker only supports some simple tools such as Ping driver and HTTP ping driver. In this spec, we propose a new monitoring driver which is implemented in Tacker. Particularly, our monitoring driver has the ability to get alarms related to hardware resources such as CPU usage or memory usage. The support of this monitoring driver is necessary for VNF management because of following reasons: * The behavior of VNF instance tightly depends on NFV infrastructure. Actually, VNF instance is designed to run inside a virtual machine (VM). When VM is broken by hardware failure, VNF cannot work well. Currently, in order to detect hardware failure, alarm configuration related to CPU usage and memory usage could be created by Heat in terms of Heat auto-scaling. However, a user of NFV could hardly change alarm parameters like threshold, period and actions. * Another goal is to support high availability for Service Function Chain (SFC). Some fault VNFs detected by the monitoring driver can belong to several chains, therefore ensuring high availability for SFC should be considered. Service Function Chaining management has been approved by Tacker, but no mechanism is used to support high availability for SFC. * Currently, Tacker deploys VNFs on a single OpenStack site. Recently, supporting multisite VIM has been taken into consideration and therefore Tacker also has the ability to support VNF management on multiple OpenStack sites. This implies that a monitoring driver in Tacker should be supported to the multisite scenario. It is feasible to deploy our monitoring driver in multisite scenario because our proposal is to get alarm triggered from Ceilometer. Actually, each site always has an OpenStack Ceilometer. Proposal change: =============== As discussed earlier, alarm-based monitoring driver implemented in OpenStack Tacker can monitor instances by using alarms from OpenStack Ceilometer. The main focus in this spec is on Tacker, Ceilometer and the combination between them as described in Figure 1. Ceilometer encompasses three main components: API service, computer agent, and alarm evaluator. As described in Figure 2, API service provides the API so that other OpenStack projects can use to access into database. Computer agent is responsible monitoring instances and collecting data. Based on collected data, alarm evaluator will raise the alarm and trigger it to target projects.

The purpose is to make CPU usage reach threshold. - Check CPU usage inside VNF. 2. SFC use case - Create vnfd from the alarm-based VNFD template - Create vnf from the vnfd - Create chain from some vnfs - Stress VM which VNF is running on. The purpose is to make CPU usage reach threshold - When VNF is replaced, show chain to see the change of the forwarding graph.

In 'nova.volume.cinder.API.initialize_connection' method, all exceptions
threw by 'terminate_connection' will be caught and logged. When log the
exceptions, the code try to record the 'code' attribute of the exception
since the code is expecting a CinderClientException or NovaException[1].
But if the some else exception(like TypeError) which doesn't have a code
on it was threw up, we will got a AttributeError.

This commit add logic to check if the exception has a code on it before
try to read it.

Fix an error that occurs when trying to marshal an
oslo_i18n._message.Message object via xmlrpclib.

xmlrpclib is not designed to marshal custom objects.  Since
nova_version is only used for this one purpose, don't internationalize
it.

This commit removes the file storing from the rss endpoint. The code
is buggy and also a potential sec issue. It also isn't actually needed
as most (if not all) rss reader will handle missing entries fine, as
long as the ids are unique it shouldn't matter. So even if we lose old
entries on a crash or restart it won't be an issue.
