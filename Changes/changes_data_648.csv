A single paragraph of prose that operators can understand. Some notes about using this template: * Your spec should be in ReSTructured text, like this template. * Please wrap text at 80 columns. * The filename in the git repository should match the launchpad URL, for example a URL of: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tacker/+spec/awesome-thing should be named awesome-thing.rst * Please do not delete any of the sections in this template. If you have nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None * For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html * To test out your formatting, build the docs using tox, or see: http://rst.ninjs.org * If you would like to provide a diagram with your spec, text representations are preferred. http://asciiflow.com/ is a very nice tool to assist with making ascii diagrams. blockdiag is another tool. These are described below. If you require an image (screenshot) for your BP, attaching that to the BP and checking it in is also accepted.

Ensure you are clear about the actors in each use case: End User vs Deployer * For a major reworking of something existing it would describe the problems in that feature that are being addressed. Proposed change =============== Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How do you propose to solve this problem? If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In other words, what's the scope of this effort? Alternatives ------------ What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one. Data model impact ----------------- Changes which require modifications to the data model often have a wider impact on the system. The community often has strong opinions on how the data model should be evolved, from both a functional and performance perspective. It is therefore important to capture and gain agreement as early as possible on any proposed changes to the data model. Questions which need to be addressed by this section include: * What new data objects and/or database schema changes is this going to require? * What database migrations will accompany this change. * How will the initial set of new data objects be generated, for example if you need to take into account existing instances, or modify other existing data describe how that will work. REST API impact --------------- For each API resource to be implemented using Tacker's attribute map facility (see the tacker.api.v2.attributes), describe the resource collection and specify the name, type, and other essential details of each new or modified attribute. A table similar to the following may be used: +----------+-------+---------+---------+------------+--------------+ |Attribute |Type |Access |Default |Validation/ |Description | |Name | | |Value |Conversion | | +==========+=======+=========+=========+============+==============+ |id |string |RO, all |generated|N/A |identity | | |(UUID) | | | | | +----------+-------+---------+---------+------------+--------------+ |name |string |RW, all |'' |string |human-readable| | | | | | |name | +----------+-------+---------+---------+------------+--------------+ |color |string |RW, admin|'red' |'red', |color | | | | | |'yellow', or|indicating | | | | | |'green' |state | +----------+-------+---------+---------+------------+--------------+ Here is the other example of the table using csv-table .. csv-table:: CSVTable :header: Attribute Name,Type,Access,Default Value,Validation Conversion,Description id,string (UUID),""RO, all"",generated,N/A,identity name,string,""RW, all"",""''"",string,human-readable name color,string,""RW, admin"",red,""'red', 'yellow' or 'green'"",color indicating state Each API method which is either added or changed that does not use Tacker's attribute map facility should have the following: * Specification for the method * A description of what the method does suitable for use in user documentation * Method type (POST/PUT/GET/DELETE) * Normal http response code(s) * Expected error http response code(s) * A description for each possible error code should be included describing semantic errors which can cause it such as inconsistent parameters supplied to the method, or when an instance is not in an appropriate state for the request to succeed. Errors caused by syntactic problems covered by the JSON schema defintion do not need to be included. * URL for the resource * Parameters which can be passed via the url * JSON schema definition for the body data if allowed * JSON schema definition for the response data if any * Example use case including typical API samples for both data supplied by the caller and the response * Discuss any API policy changes, and discuss what things a deployer needs to think about when defining their API policy. This is in reference to the policy.json file. Note that the schema should be defined as restrictively as possible. Parameters which are required should be marked as such and only under exceptional circumstances should additional parameters which are not defined in the schema be permitted (eg additionaProperties should be False). Reuse of existing predefined parameter types such as regexps for passwords and user defined names is highly encouraged. Security impact --------------- Describe any potential security impact on the system. Some of the items to consider include: * Does this change touch sensitive data such as tokens, keys, or user data? * Does this change alter the API in a way that may impact security, such as a new way to access sensitive information or a new way to login? * Does this change involve cryptography or hashing? * Does this change require the use of sudo or any elevated privileges? * Does this change involve using or parsing user-provided data? This could be directly at the API level or indirectly such as changes to a cache layer. * Can this change enable a resource exhaustion attack, such as allowing a single API interaction to consume significant server resources? Some examples of this include launching subprocesses for each connection, or entity expansion attacks in XML. For more detailed guidance, please see the OpenStack Security Guidelines as a reference (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/Guidelines). These guidelines are a work in progress and are designed to help you identify security best practices. For further information, feel free to reach out to the OpenStack Security Group at openstack-security@lists.openstack.org. Notifications impact -------------------- Please specify any changes to notifications. Be that an extra notification, changes to an existing notification, or removing a notification. Other end user impact --------------------- Aside from the API, are there other ways a user will interact with this feature? * Does this change have an impact on python-tackerclient? What does the user interface there look like? Performance Impact ------------------ Describe any potential performance impact on the system, for example how often will new code be called, and is there a major change to the calling pattern of existing code. Examples of things to consider here include: * A periodic task might look like a small addition but if it calls conductor or another service the load is multiplied by the number of nodes in the system. * A small change in a utility function or a commonly used decorator can have a large impacts on performance. * Calls which result in a database queries (whether direct or via conductor) can have a profound impact on performance when called in critical sections of the code. * Will the change include any locking, and if so what considerations are there on holding the lock? Other deployer impact --------------------- Discuss things that will affect how you deploy and configure OpenStack that have not already been mentioned, such as: * What config options are being added? Should they be more generic than proposed (for example a flag that other hypervisor drivers might want to implement as well)? Are the default values ones which will work well in real deployments? * Is this a change that takes immediate effect after its merged, or is it something that has to be explicitly enabled? * If this change is a new binary, how would it be deployed? * Please state anything that those doing continuous deployment, or those upgrading from the previous release, need to be aware of. Also describe any plans to deprecate configuration values or features. For example, if we change the directory name that instances are stored in, how do we handle instance directories created before the change landed? Do we move them? Do we have a special case in the code? Do we assume that the operator will recreate all the instances in their cloud? Developer impact ---------------- Discuss things that will affect other developers working on OpenStack, such as: * If the blueprint proposes a change to the API, discussion of how other plugins would implement the feature is required. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: <launchpad-id or None> Other contributors: <launchpad-id or None> Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Apart from the main functionality, the developer needs to deliver the following work items as part of any major blueprint: * Unit Tests * Functional Tests * Feature documentation in doc/source/devref/feature NOTE: This feature documentation should be treated like code. Preferably this should be included in the primary patchset itself and not as an afterthought. This is also mandatory for a blueprint to be marked complete. Dependencies ============ * Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in tacker, or in other projects, that this one either depends on or is related to. * If this requires functionality of another project that is not currently used by Tacker (such as the glance v2 API when we previously only required v1), document that fact. * Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not included in OpenStack? Or does it depend on a specific version of library? Testing ======= Please discuss how the change will be tested. We especially want to know what tempest tests will be added. It is assumed that unit test coverage will be added so that doesn't need to be mentioned explicitly, but discussion of why you think unit tests are sufficient and we don't need to add more tempest tests would need to be included. Is this untestable in gate given current limitations (specific hardware / software configurations available)? If so, are there mitigation plans (3rd party testing, gate enhancements, etc). Documentation Impact ==================== What is the impact on the docs team of this change? Some changes might require donating resources to the docs team to have the documentation updated. Don't repeat details discussed above, but please reference them here. References ========== Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any reference. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are: * Links to mailing list or IRC discussions * Links to notes from a summit session * Links to relevant research, if appropriate * Related specifications as appropriate (e.g. link any vendor documentation) * Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to ",,437,0

We are going to introduce a concept 'volume mapping' that represents
a mapping between Cinder volume and Zun container. Each volume mapping
entry stores the uuid of the Cinder volume and Zun container, as well

There is another patch that introduced volume mapping in DB layer.
This patch introduce volume mapping in object layer.

With cell v2, on initial bring up, discover hosts can't run unless all
the compute nodes have checked in. The documentation says that you
should run ``nova service-list --binary nova-compute`` and see all
your hosts before running discover hosts. This isn't really viable in
a multinode devstack because of how things are brought up in parts.

We can however know that stack.sh will not complete before the compute
node is up by waiting for the compute node to check in before
completing. This happens quite late in the stack.sh run, so shouldn't
add any extra time in most runs.

Cells v1 and Xenserver don't use real hostnames in the service table
(they encode complex data that is hostname like to provide more
topology information than just hostnames). They are exempted from this
check.

stestr [1][2][3] is a fork of the testrepository project that
concentrates on being a dedicated parallel python test runner. It fixes
a bunch of bugs and adds a bunch of features on top of testrepository.
Moving forward several projects will be migrating to using it instead of
testr by itself. (long term I'd like to get everything over to use
stestr) The plan is to also switch os-testr under the covers
eventually. To support the migration in the future this commit makes
sure the post processing steps we do in run_tox.sh can handle runs from
stestr as well as testrepository. The basic flow is the same but the
command and repository paths are slightly different.

We have seen in Dragonflow tempest tests that docker bridges do not
always clean-up correctly, and this causes false-positive errors.

This change modifies the name of the bridge to be unique for each test.
This way, if a test fails to clean up, it will not affect the other
tests.

Add support for openstack hosted pre-provisioned undercloud and
overcloud cluster nodes, identified by a clusterid metadata
(optional). Adapt the tripleo-inventory role for that need. Access overcloud nodes over a particular private admin/control network
(multiple networks supported) via the undercloud floating IP,
acting as a bastion node public IP.

List of changes:
* Reuse access URL/creds and clouds.yaml template from the
  extras' OVB roles' defaults.
* Split inventory generation tasks into the openstack provider
  case and remaining all/multinode/undercloud cases.
* Add var overcloud_user (defaults to heat-admin), overcloud_key,
  undercloud_key instead of hardcoded values.
* Rely on shade dynamic inventory and update requirements.txt for os-
  client-config and jmespath as well.
  for its dependencies to become the part of quickstart deps.
* Add docs

Deploying the multi-node-aio from master on a machine running Ubuntu
14.04 fails frequently as libvirt doesn't think it has the hvm
OS type.  I was able to manually run ""virsh capabilities"" shortly after
libvirt was installed and sure enough it didn't list any guest
capabilities.  Subsequent runs of ""virsh capabilities"" then returned
the <guest> XML element w/ <os_type>hvm</os_type> defined.

This commit simply adds a task that checks ""virsh capabilities"",
retrying up to 6 times if the <guest> element is not present.  From my
limit testing this seems sufficient to ensure that the domains are
defined and created successfully.

Lastly, we add a task to create /etc/libvirt/storage which is expected
to exist, but doesn't on a 14.04 deployment.

This new extension allows to set mtu on create and update. Plugins are
free to implement only create if needed, returning a meaningful error if
update is not supported. Plugins should also make sure that MTU makes
general sense in context of corresponding deployment.

Plugins supporting the new extension are expected to signal support for
net-mtu too because the new extension is a superset of the old feature.

We can't just update the existing net-mtu extension because then support
for writes is not discoverable.

An advantage of consuming keystoneauth is that the application doesn't
need to know the details of the authentication sequence to use the
library. Currently in testing they are having to provide a specific auth
plugin and this means their tests execute this full auth sequence and
they have to mock that out.

Create a SimpleTestPlugin that has the standard values that an
application might be interested in. This can be used in testing instead
of a real plugin to remove any network interaction and simplify the
authentication component so applications can focus on their problems.

We then create 2 fixtures that will mock out functions to load the
SimpleTestPlugin instead of a real plugin in application code.

The SimpleLoaderFixture will mock out all calls to keystoneauth plugin
loading and return the basic plugin, which is going to be sufficient for
testing for most applications.

The SimplePluginFixutre will mock out a specific function and return a
SimpleTestPlugin so that applications can mock out just a specific
section of loading code.

This patch completes the api ref for standard attribute based revision
numbers by:
- Updating applicable resource JSON responses to include
revision_number.
- Documents the revision_number response param where missing.
- Adds a section in the intro about revisions as well as conditional
HTTP based operations using If-Match header.
- Standardizes the revision_number response param; doesn't seem
necessary for each resource to have it's own.

When manila is deployed with self-signed SSL certificates, its tempest
tests fail with a certificate verification error. In this deployment
scenario, manila can not be tempest tested.

This patch uses the value of the generic option
`identity.disable_ssl_certificate_validation` from `tempest.conf` to
optionally disable certificate verification in manila tests, allowing
operators to test a manila deployment with self-signed SSL certificates.

To enable, the following has to be set in `tempest.conf`:

This messaging middleware (the RPC messaging system) enables the OpenStack services that run on multiple servers to talk to each other. By default, the RPC messaging client is set to timeout after 60 seconds, meaning if any operation you perform takes longer than 60 seconds to complete the operation will timeout and fail with the ERROR message ""Messaging Timeout: Timed out waiting for a reply to message ID [message_id]"" If this occurs, increase the ``rpc_response_timeout`` flag value in ``cinder.conf`` and ``nova.conf`` on all Cinder and Nova nodes and restart the services. What to change this value to will depend entirely on your own environment, you might only need to increase it slightly, or if your environment is under heavy network load it could need a bit more time than normal. Fine tuning is required here, change the value and run intensive operations to determine if your timeout value matches your environment requirements. ",,21,0

With cell v2, on initial bring up, discover hosts can't run unless all
the compute nodes have checked in. The documentation says that you
should run ``nova service-list --binary nova-compute`` and see all
your hosts before running discover hosts. This isn't really viable in
a multinode devstack because of how things are brought up in parts.

We can however know that stack.sh will not complete before the compute
node is up by waiting for the compute node to check in before
completing. This happens quite late in the stack.sh run, so shouldn't
add any extra time in most runs.

Cells v1 and Xenserver don't use real hostnames in the service table
(they encode complex data that is hostname like to provide more
topology information than just hostnames). They are exempted from this
check.

Deleting snapshot may take time. The current volume API does not allow
to delete volumes with snapshots, so if deleting snapshot may take time,
a delete request for a parent volume will fail.
This sometimes causes functional test failures in slow environments.

wait_for_status() checks whether volume status is in error statuses
but previously the expected error status was wrong. Cinder API uses
lower case as volume status, so it did not work expectedly.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================== Migration Allocations ===================== Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/migration-allocations In Pike, we realized that there is a gap in the way we were planning to handle allocations for instances during move operations. In order to avoid releasing resources on the source node in order to claim against the target node, we need a placeholder or temporary owner. Currently, we solve this by allocating against the source and destination nodes for the instance, so it looks like the instance is using resources on both at the same time. This works, but it makes it harder to determine which node owns the process of releasing the other half of this ""double"" allocation during success and failure scenarios. Things are further complicated by the potential for same-host migrations. Problem description =================== The problem we have is that currently the scheduler must know that we're performing a move operation, and must add an allocation for the instance against the target node, leaving the existing allocation against the source node. After a successful or failed migration, one of the compute nodes must clean up the correct half of the doubled allocation to avoid the instance continuing to consume more than one spot. Use Cases --------- As an operator, I want proper resource accounting during a move operation to make sure compute nodes don't become overcommitted while instances are moving. As a nova developer, I want a clear assignment of responsibilities for each allocation in placement so that the code to allocate an deallocate for an instance is simple and straightforward. Proposed change =============== The overall proposed change is to let the migration operation itself, as identified by a migration record in the database, ""own"" one of the two allocations necessary to reserve resources. Instead of trying to have the instance be the consumer of two sets of allocations against the two nodes involved (source and destination), we can let the instance own one and the migration own the other. In order to do this, the migration record must have a uuid identifier, which is the first change that needs to be made. Once we have that, we will change the existing migration code to replace the allocation that the instance has against the source node with an identical one with the migration as the owner. Next, we allocate for the instance (new flavor if resizing) against the destination node. If the migration is successful, we can simply delete the migration-owned allocation against the source node when the operation is complete (or confirmed). Upon failure, we do the opposite, deleting the target allocation and replacing the source allocation with one owned by the instance. The benefit here is that instead of trying to double-allocate for an instance, and then having to subtract the source node/flavor from that allocation on success, we can simply operate on allocations atomically (i.e. create/delete) as the design intends. This makes the math and mechanics the same for single and multi-host move operations, and avoids one compute node manipulating allocations against another. Alternatives ------------ When we discovered this issue late in Pike, we implemented the primary alternative approach because it was less disruptive. That option is to replace the allocation for the instance against the source node with one against both the source and destination nodes during the operation. This is still an option, but in practice the math (especially for single-host moves) is vague and imprecise, and the ownership responsibility for each compute node is obscure. Data model impact ----------------- The primary impact here is adding a uuid to the migration object which can be used as the consumer for the source allocation in placement. REST API impact --------------- No direct API impact Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- If there are custom tools developed to read usage information out of placement, then there could be some user-visible change between pike and queens. This would be in the realm of a pike deployment showing a large intermediate allocation/usage by the instance, which won't happen after this change unless the tool takes migration-owned allocations into account. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- As mentioned above, deployers could see some impact here if they have written custom tools against placement for data gathering. However, it seems unlikely at this point. Developer impact ---------------- Developer impact of this will be overwhelmingly positive once the initial complexity of handling the migration of the ""pike way"" to the ""queens way"". Ownership of the allocations will be clear and concise, and the code required for cleanup after a migration will be significantly simpler. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: danms Work Items ---------- * Add a uuid to the migration record * Migrate existing/outstanding migration records to give them a uuid * Make the compute node code able to handle either the doubled allocation strategy (pike) or the split allocation strategy (queens) * Make the scheduler create allocations using either strategy, determined by whether or not there are pike nodes in the deployment Dependencies ============ None? Testing ======= As part of the fire drill at the end of pike, we now have a fairly comprehensive set of functional tests that verify the allocation behavior during a migration. These should outline the coverage we need, although the expected behavior at each point will be different. These tests could easily be duplicated and preserved for testing pike behavior, and then the original tests can be modified to verify queens behavior. Once we're past queens we can delete the pike behavior tests when we drop that code. Documentation Impact ==================== Since this should ideally be invisible from the outside, no documentation impact is expected. References ========== See the mess in pike.

It would fail if no ``image_source`` was provided in the node's ``instance_info`` field because it would try to validate the ``image_source`` which didn't exist. There is no need to specify the ``image_source`` and the validation is no longer being attempted.

Currently on L3 agent restart FWaaS L3 agent extension
_process_router_update iterates over all router ports and
trigger firewall group update if a port belong to it.
In case when a firewall group contains several ports iptables rules
get re-written each time and in the result only the chains for
the last port in a loop remain.

With this change each firewall group would be updated with a full
list of a router ports that belong to it. Additionaly, refactor of
the _process_router_update method reduced its complexity and made
it more readable.
If a router would appear to have ports associated with several
firewall groups a warning would be emitted.

Added a unit test.

A function is a not a utility if it's only used in one place. Keeping
such functions in a 'utils' module makes things a little harder to
reason about, results in code being left over when the sole caller is
removed, and makes said 'utils' module look like a dumping ground.

Continue cleaning out the closet here by moving some of the more
complex, esoteric functions to their calling files.

oslo_reports accepts a few config options that cannot be used at
the moment since nova does not pass the config object.

This change ensures that we properly set up oslo_reports when
starting the nova services.

`delete_row(...)` was deleting by `id` which is not existing in the
OpenDaylightJournal model. To solve it, it now deletes by `seqnum` which
is the correct PRIMARY KEY for it.

This was not a problem before, because the function was never called
with that parametrization and also unit tests weren't present for it.
This now adds unit tests to avoid the problem in the future.

When updating the rows in batch the DB would try to lock all rows even
if they don't answer the WHERE clause. This would include freshly
inserted rows, which were locked.
This would then cause a deadlock if the inserted row had a dependency on
a row already locked by the cleanup transaction, as the DB tries to low
both entries referenced by the dependeices table's foreign keys.

Updating the rows one by one avoids this unnecessary complication.

nova.virt.hardware.InstanceInfo had several fields that have never been
used since their inception two and a half years ago [1].  This change set
removes them.  They are (were):

max_mem_kb: (int) the maximum memory in KBytes allowed
mem_kb: (int) the memory in KBytes used by the instance
num_cpu: (int) the number of virtual CPUs for the
         instance
cpu_time_ns: (int) the CPU time used in nanoseconds

We also rename the 'id' field to 'internal_id' for two reasons: First,
because 'id' is a builtin; second, to emphasize that this is not
(necessarily) tied to the Instance's real id/uuid.

Upstream iptables added support for -w ('wait') argument to
iptables-restore. It makes the command grab a 'xlock' that guarantees
that no two iptables calls will mess a table if called in parallel.
[This somewhat resembles what we try to achieve with a file lock we
grab in iptables manager's _apply_synchronized.]

If two processes call to iptables-restore or iptables in parallel, the
second call risks failing, returning error code = 4, and also printing
the following error:

    Another app is currently holding the xtables lock. Perhaps you want
    to use the -w option?

If we call to iptables / iptables-restore with -w though, it will wait
for the xlock release before proceeding, and won't fail.

Though the feature was added in iptables/master only and is not part of
an official iptables release, it was already backported to RHEL 7.x
iptables package, and so we need to adopt to it. At the same time, we
can't expect any underlying platform to support the argument.

A solution here is to call iptables-restore with -w when a regular call
failed. Also, the patch adds -w to all iptables calls, in the iptables
manager as well as in ipset-cleanup.

Since we don't want to lock agent in case current xlock owner doesn't
release it in reasonable time, we limit the time we wait to ~1/3 of
report_interval, to give the agent some time to recover without
triggering expensive fullsync.

In the future, we may be able to get rid of our custom synchronization
lock that we use in iptables manager. But this will require all
supported platforms to get the feature in and will take some time.

This commit removes the try except logic in the dynamic creds cleanup
path around deleting the default security group for the created tenant.
There was a lengthy comment around that block explaining we couldn't
use the extension helper because of a circular import dependency.
However, that issue has been recently resolved so this just uses the
helper.

the code which waits for metadata service to be provisioned in the

Also, when metadata is disabled, an error was logged trying to retrieve

Introduces a new validation to ensure the node deallocation
process will only be performed to nodes that have Server
Profile applied in OneView. When the allocation process
fails, the machine will have no Server Profile applied in
OneView and in ironic it will have no reference to any
Server Profile. Under these conditions if the deallocation
process be performed the driver will try to delete a
nonexistent Server Profile in OneView, leaving the node
in error state in ironic.

Add logic to pecan to add 'project_id' as a mandatory policy

This logic was added to the previous controller code to ensure

Separate user-applied filters from policy-enforcement
filters processing and put it at the end of the pipeline
so users can't put filters on the API request that impact

This prevents a filter excluding the ID field from breaking
pagination.

They can be installed on most popular operating system using their package manager (for Ubuntu - *apt*, for Fedora - *dnf*, CentOS - *yum*, for Mac OS - *brew* or *macports*). The list of needed packages is shown below: 1. **python-dev** 2. **python-setuptools** 3. **python-pip** 4. **libffi-dev** 5. **libxslt1-dev (or libxslt-dev)** 6. **libxml2-dev** 7. **libyaml-dev** 8. **libssl-dev** In case of Ubuntu, just run:: $ apt-get install -y python-dev python-setuptools python-pip libffi-dev libxslt1-dev \ libxml2-dev libyaml-dev libssl-dev **NOTE:** **Qinling can be used without authentication at all or it can work with OpenStack.** In case of OpenStack, it works **only on Keystone v3**, make sure **Keystone v3** is installed. Installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~ First of all, clone the repo and go to the repo directory:: $ git clone https://github.com/openstack/qinling.git $ cd qinling Generate config:: $ tox -egenconfig Configure Qinling as needed. The configuration file is located in ``etc/qinling.conf.sample``. You will need to modify the configuration options and then copy it into ``/etc/qinling/qinling.conf``. For details see :doc:`Qinling Configuration Guide </guides/configuration_guide>` **Virtualenv installation**:: $ tox This will install necessary virtual environments and run all the project tests. Installing virtual environments may take significant time (~10-15 mins). **Local installation**:: $ pip install -e . or:: $ pip install -r requirements.txt $ python setup.py install **NOTE**: Differences *pip install -e* and *setup.py install*. **pip install -e** works very similarly to **setup.py install** or the EasyInstall tool, except that it doesn’t actually install anything. Instead, it creates a special .egg-link file in the deployment directory, that links to your project’s source code. Before the first run ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ After installation you will see **qinling-server** and **qinling-db-manage** commands in your environment, either in system or virtual environment. **NOTE**: In case of using **virtualenv**, all Qinling related commands available via **tox -evenv --**. For example, *qinling-server* is available via *tox -evenv -- qinling-server*. **qinling-db-manage** command can be used for migrations. For updating the database to the latest revision type:: $ qinling-db-manage --config-file <path-to-qinling.conf> upgrade head Before starting Qinling server, run *qinling-db-manage populate* command. It prepares the DB, creates in it with all standard actions and standard workflows which Qinling provides for all Qinling users.:: $ qinling-db-manage --config-file <path-to-qinling.conf> populate For more detailed information about *qinling-db-manage* script please see :doc:`Qinling Upgrade Guide </guides/upgrade_guide>`. **NOTE**: For users who want a dry run with **SQLite** database backend(not used in production), *qinling-db-manage* is not recommended for database initialization because of `SQLite limitations <http://www.sqlite.org/omitted.html>`_. Please use sync_db script described below instead for database initialization. **If you use virtualenv**:: $ tools/sync_db.sh --config-file <path-to-qinling.conf> **Or run sync_db directly**:: $ python tools/sync_db.py --config-file <path-to-qinling.conf> Running Qinling API server ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ To run Qinling API server perform the following command in a shell:: $ qinling-server --server api --config-file <path-to-qinling.conf> Running Qinling Engines ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ To run Qinling Engine perform the following command in a shell:: $ qinling-server --server engine --config-file <path-to-qinling.conf> Running Qinling Task Executors ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ To run Qinling Task Executor instance perform the following command in a shell:: $ qinling-server --server executor --config-file <path-to-qinling.conf> Note that at least one Engine instance and one Executor instance should be running so that workflow tasks are processed by Qinling. Running Multiple Qinling Servers Under the Same Process ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ To run more than one server (API, Engine, or Task Executor) on the same process, perform the following command in a shell:: $ qinling-server --server api,engine --config-file <path-to-qinling.conf> The --server command line option can be a comma delimited list. The valid options are ""all"" (by default if not specified) or any combination of ""api"", ""engine"", and ""executor"". It's important to note that the ""fake"" transport for the rpc_backend defined in the config file should only be used if ""all"" the Qinling servers are launched on the same process.

Driverfixes branches are meant to track their parent stable branches

Since requirements are not branched along with these branches, there
is no need to have a change proposed to switch their upper constraints

This follows the RabbitMQ docs [1] for enabling TLS for the replication

Unfortunately, pacemaker uses the shortname for the rabbitmq nodes, so
we are not able to do proper verification of the certificates, since we

determine_ports() was not adding the nova-placement-api port to the
ports list because it is run under the apache2 service. This fix
enables determine_ports() to get 'nova-placement-api' from the list
of services rather than 'apache2', allowing it to determine the port
that nova-placement-api uses.

Also enable tests/gate-basic-xenial-ocata in this commit.

The L3 HA RPC code that creates HA interfaces can race
with an HA router deletion on the server side. The L3 HA
code ends up creating a port on the HA network while the
server side is deleting the router and the HA network.

This stops the L3 HA network from being deleted because
it has a new port without a bound segment, which leaves the
HA network in a segmentless condition and no ports after
the L3 RPC code cleans up its port.

This adjusts the L3 RPC logic to attempt an HA network cleanup
whenever it encounters the concurrent router deletion case
to ensure that the HA network gets cleaned up.

To make this more robust in the future, we may need the L3
HA code to recognize when an HA network has no segments and
automatically create a new one.

The CentOS gate jobs have been plagued by intermittent network
connectivity issues, including failures downloading yum metadata
and failures resolving DNS records. This is happening because
dnsmasq is inaccessible and network paths are broken.

The lxc-net service is trampling on the ifup hooks that run
lxc-system-manage, which takes care of the routes, iptables rules,
and dnsmasq. This patch disables, stops, and masks the lxc-net
service on CentOS to match Ubuntu.

This change removes the entry to containerise docker by default
because it should now be disabled since the change
Id2e6550fb7c319fc52469644ea022cf35757e0ce.

Removing the entry means the default mapping to mongodb-disabled.yaml
takes effect.

This change also modifies the upgrade_tasks so that the mongod service
is only disabled when the service exists. There appears to be upgrade
scenarios which fail because mongodb was never installed in the first
place.

This updates the way we're creating the ironic_client so that it
always does discovery, which _baremetal_client will always have

Currently for non controller upgrades we're looping through the
upgrade steps and run the upgrade tasks based on when conditionals
including the step number and the existing upgrade task condition.
Some of tasks fail because the variables used in when conditionals
are not available through all steps. This change adds default values
to these vars where possible or creates them for all steps to avoid
failures.

The multinode gate is reserved for tests that require multiple nodes
like server migration tests. It is also used for slow-running
tests that take a while to execute (20-30+ seconds) to better
parallelize tests in the gates.

However, 3 tests currently meet neither of these criteria and are
hence being moved to the voting gates:

  * test_remove_security_group_from_server [6.525612s]

We thought _get_floatingips_bound_to_host is not needed but removing the
method caused sending garps for fip that doesn't belong to node during
the full-sync.

This patch just replaces dict lookup with get() method, so fips are
filtered based on presence on the host and if host is not set on fip, it
won't raise a KeyError.

Current RBD code is incorrectly reporting the stats of the pool in the
following ways:

- `provisioned_capacity_gb` contains physical space used by cinder created
  volumes.
- `free_capacity_gb` is not taking into account that pools can have quota
  restrictions and they should be used as the reference for the free capacity.
- `total_capacity` dynamically changes, which means that there is no way to
  have a fixed over provisioning capacity.

This patch fixes the stats reporting making sure we return the right
values in `provisioned_capacity_gb` and `free_capacity_gb`, and allows
us to use a static calculation of the `total_capacity` using
`report_dynamic_total_capacity` configuration option.

We don't report `allocated_capacity_gb` because this is something that
is calculated by the Cinder core code and should not be reported by
drivers, even if it's not currently working as expected [1][2].

Starting in Pike, the scheduler creates an allocation on a
chosen destination node during live migration. This happens
before the destination node pre-checks occur, which could
fail and trigger a retry to the scheduler. The allocations
created in Placement against the failed destination node
were not being cleaned up though.

This change adds some cleanup code to the live migration task
in conductor to clean the allocations for the failed destination
node before retrying.

The functional recreate test for the bug is updated to show
that the bug is fixed now.

Also updates the docstring in the SchedulerReportClient
remove_provider_from_instance_allocation method so that we
no longer have to enumerate all of the places that call it.

This requires refactoring of the manifests as the parameter is common to

Introduce configuration parameters to specify the oslo.messaging
rpc or notification backend as one of rabbit, amqp. The default
config is to use rabbit broker for both rpc and notification. Selection
of amqp for rpc will use brokerless qpid-dispatch router.

This patch:
* Adds notification_transport_url parameter across services where needed
* Adds rpc and notification parameters to config
* Adds qdr for rpc amqp1 configuration
* Modifies scenario001 for dual messaging backends
* supports ssl config

This change fixes an issue that caused a node using a Dell EMC
integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) classic driver,
'pxe_drac' or 'pxe_drac_inspector', to be placed in the 'clean failed'
state after a double manage/provide cycle, instead of the 'available'
state.

The deploy interface implementation used by iDRAC classic drivers has
been class ironic.drivers.modules.drac.deploy.DracDeploy, which is
derived from class ironic.drivers.modules.iscsi_deploy.ISCSIDeploy. The
only difference between them is that DracDeploy overrides the
prepare_cleaning() method to prevent the booting of the Ironic Python
Agent (IPA) ramdisk when only out-of-band RAID clean steps are
requested. However, it caused the issue and did not have its intended
effect, because Ironic Conductor boots the ramdisk regardless. The
Ironic Conductor should be modified to preclude the booting of the IPA
ramdisk fix, rather than leaving it to individual drivers.

The iDRAC classic drivers' deploy interface implementation has been
changed to ISCSIDeploy. Since class DracDeploy is no longer needed, its
source code and automated tests have been removed.

The OpenStack tox jobs needs upper constratints support, but if we add
it like it's done in the v2 job we'll wind up with openstack-tox-py27
and tox-py27. On the other hand, providing an interface for non-OpenStack
users to make use of an upper-constratints system like we have would be
nice.

Every tox job in OpenStack today does an additional git clone of
openstack/requirements, then copies the upper-constraints.txt
file to the source dir of the project. All of devstack jobs clone
openstack/requirements. If we go ahead and add it to base, it'll always
be available to folks and should not be a significant extra burden.

Finally, by setting the variable with the location of the requirements u-c
file in the base job, we can update the tox base job in zuul-jobs to
optionally set UPPER_CONSTRAINTS_FILE if the variable is set and the file
is present. This will let other installations set up a similar shared
upper-constraints, while not affecting installations that do not care.

Tempest is making credentials_factory as stable interface
and will be removing the AdminManager class which is wrapper
of creating client manager wirth admin cred.

admin manager can be instantiated by providing the admin cred
to clients.Manager.

This commit removes the usage of AdminManager.

If port update event is received by L2 agent and there is
no QoS policy assigned to such port, agent tries to delete
any existing QoS rules from port.
For bandwidth limit rules OVS qos driver tries to update
port in OVS database.
In case if port not exists in OVS database agent raised
exception.

This patch fixes that by checking if port really exists and
removing QoS bandwidth limit rules only for existing ports.

Per the previous code comment, we can now use shred to zero
volumes efficiently on modern distros. Let's do that.

A thread on openstack-dev (http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2017-August/121301.html)
confirms that all our supported distros now use a new enough
version of shred.

NEC driver fails to start because it can not
read default configuration values.
NEC driver refers oslo_config.cfg.GroupAttr object,
but the object no longer has default configuration values.
The values were moved when 'backend_defaults' was introduced.

This patch reads default configuration values via
Configuration.safe_get().

This change moves into ovs_lib the behavior ensuring that
ovs-ofctl is used with the right OF protocol version: the
highest of all versions configured with use_at_least_protocol().

This use_at_least_protocol() method keeps track of the highest
version requested, and also calls add_protocols to ensure that
this version is actually available on the bridge.

This change allows to avoid a wrapping/decorator in networking-sfc
(see I25fb8f35f8236c59a7dca9685a47de0ae77846bc).

For this to be possible another change is needed: if the OF version
that ends up being used is >1.0 then the strip_vlan actions can't
be used without having matched on a vlan_id ; this is achieved
in I76ee34a614237bbc99989ce9c1b96a30456be282 of which this change
is a follow-up.
