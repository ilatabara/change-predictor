As outlined in bug #1917750 the use of tgtadm in multinode environments
with multiple c-vol services can cause volumes to use duplicate WWNs.

This has been shown to cause some encrypted volume test failures as
os-brick returns a /dev/disk/by-id path to n-cpu that can point to the
wrong underlying volume when multiple volumes with the same WWN are
connected to a host.

There is also some speculation that the duplicate WWNs are also causing
libvirt to fail to detach volumes from instances but as yet this has not
been proven.

This change aims to avoid all of the above by switching the default of
CINDER_ISCSI_HELPER to lioadm for all deployments instead of just EL and
SUSE based deployments.

The Bionic platform job however is pinned to tgtadm as there issues
installing python3-rtslib-fb.

Nova vnc configuration right now uses NovaVncProxyNetwork,
NovaLibvirtNetwork and NovaApiNetwork to configure the different
components (novnc proxy, nova-compute and libvirt) for vnc.
If one of the networks get changed from internal_api, the service
configuration between libvirt, nova-compute and novnc proxy gets
inconsistent and the console is broken.
This changed to just use NovaLibvirtNetwork for configuring the vnc
endpoints and removes NovaVncProxyNetwork completely.

libguestfs >= v1.41.1 and commit 0ee02e0117527 changed the return type
of read_file from string to bytes.

https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/commit/0ee02e0117527b86a31b2a88a14994ce7f15571f

As we don't check the version of libguestfs installed this change
handles both the original behaviour where a string is returned and the
newer behaviour by decoding any returned bytes to a string.

This reverts commit 4bc33eec623095100d5b2e78dd682c6d36d36723.

Reason for revert: 
This was needed earlier when tripleo-validations and 
validations-common was added as tqe requirements[1].

We have removed tripleo-validations and validations-common
as tqe requirement in [2] and this is not needed anymore.
After [2] tripleo-validations and validations-common is coming
from rpm.

This is a backport of [1] but in between now and then the code in
tripleo_validation was move back into python-tripleoclient[2] and the

Updated _run_validator_run to no longer raise an execption if/when a group is empty

Using a log vs. exception is useful when we want to run an automated set of validations
within our Update CI pipeline.

Do not inject public certificates in pacemaker bundles by means
of ""podman cp"", as this pauses the container for a short amount
of time and can make pacemaker operation fail during that time
window and impact cluster for no reason.

Keep ""podman cp"" for non-HA containers, as the freeze is short
and doesn't seem to impact podman monitoring anyway.

The new certificate injection only works for podman 1.9+, lower
version won't overwrite the existing certificate.

Adapted from Id7308f028f33716be5e3df6699c3f2c12e33e344, as the
same behaviour is implemented in puppet-tripleo before wallaby.

The container and account auditors, and their tests are almost
identical. This patch reduces the code duplication by refactoring
into a base class called DatabaseAuditor.

This also means the container and account auditor tests have also mostly
been refactored.

Bug #1894804 outlines how DEVICE_DELETED events were often missing from
QEMU on Focal based OpenStack CI hosts as originally seen in bug
 #1882521. This has eventually been tracked down to some undefined QEMU
behaviour when a new device_del QMP command is received while another is
still being processed, causing the original attempt to be aborted.

We hit this race in slower OpenStack CI envs as n-cpu rather crudely
retries attempts to detach devices using the RetryDecorator from
oslo.service. The default incremental sleep time currently being tight
enough to ensure QEMU is still processing the first device_del request
on these slower CI hosts when n-cpu asks libvirt to retry the detach,
sending another device_del to QEMU hitting the above behaviour.

Additionally we have also seen the following check being hit when
testing with QEMU >= v5.0.0. This check now rejects overlapping
device_del requests in QEMU rather than aborting the original:

https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/cce8944cc9efab47d4bf29cfffb3470371c3541b

This change aims to avoid this situation entirely by raising the default
incremental sleep time between detach requests from 2 seconds to 10,
leaving enough time for the first attempt to complete. The overall
maximum sleep time is also increased from 30 to 60 seconds.

Future work will aim to entirely remove this retry logic with a libvirt
event driven approach, polling for the the
VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_DEVICE_REMOVED and
VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_DEVICE_REMOVAL_FAILED events before retrying.

Finally, the cleanup of unused arguments in detach_device_with_retry is
left for a follow up change in order to keep this initial change small
enough to quickly backport.

The puppetlabs-haproxy repo no longer has the master branch and
the master branch has been replaced by the main branch.
While we switched the branch in use in master[1], for stable branches
it is better to pin it to a specific version to avoid issue caused by
any future change in puppetlabs-haproxy.

The version is determined based on the version currently provided in
RDO.

We want some functionality in osc-placement. Add it here rather than
there.

Initially only the resource providers resource type is supported.
Additional resources will be added in future patches.

We're skipping the tests for the broken placement API versions, pending
discussions with keystone folks on how to resolve this long-term.

[1] 9aca21f5cec8f03a3bb410acb21399955144fe0f

Because the implementation was removed a while ago, this change doesn't
deprecate the feature but directly remove it.

A bundle encompasses multiple charms, their configuration options, and various optional elements such as hardware and network constraints. See `Charm bundles`_ in the Juju documentation.To arrive at a truly customised deployment, while taking advantage of an official base bundle, a secondary (overlay) bundle can be applied to override and fine-tune certain elements of the original bundle. The bundle recommended here is the stable release of `openstack-base`_. It is used throughout Charmed OpenStack documentation as a reference bundle. Due to unknown factors in the local environment (usually hardware-related), the bundle will probably need to be modified prior to deployment, or as mentioned, overridden with an overlay bundle.

Due to unknown factors in the local environment (usually hardware-related) the bundle will most likely need to be modified prior to deployment.

Since placement service was introduced, there have been several

compute nodes. For example with the default configurations if a user
creates multiple instances concurrently, these instances might be
packed into a single compute node because placement returns the same
results until any instance is actually launched at compute nodes.

detect that a CD device is connected.

This change will write /etc/hosts entries per plan
rather than stomping the hosts entries every time
the role is used for different stacks / plans.

We achieve this by differentiating the blocks of IP
addresses to ensure they are not modified by unrelated
executions of the role.

The puppetlabs-haproxy repo no longer has the master branch and
the master branch has been replaced by the main branch.
While we switched the branch in use in master[1], for stable branches
it is better to pin it to a specific version to avoid issue caused by
any future change in puppetlabs-haproxy.

The version is determined based on the version currently provided in
RDO.

This change adds support for network configuration via systemd-networkd
on Ubuntu systems.

This is implemented via an Ansible Galaxy role,
stackhpc.systemd_networkd which was forked from
aruhier.systemd_networkd. Several improvements were made in
https://github.com/stackhpc/ansible-role-systemd-networkd/pull/1,
including:

* Add support for removing unexpected config files
* Use become where necessary
* Refactor config generation into a single task to improve performance

The systemd_networkd role does not add much abstraction on top of the
systemd-networkd configuration file format, which provides a lot of
flexibility at the expense of additional code in Kayobe. This code is
implemented as filter plugins, similarly to the existing
MichaelRigart.interfaces role.

This patch includes support for:

* Ethernet interfaces
* bridges
* bonds
* VLANs
* virtual Ethernet pairs (to connect Linux bridges and OVS bridges)
* static IP addresses
* static routes
* MTU

Some network attributes are currently not supported for
systemd-networkd:

* rules
* route options
* ethtool_opts
* zone
* allowed addresses

In case when enforce_new_defaults is set to True and new policy rules
are used, context.is_admin flag isn't really working as it was with old

But in case when elevated context is needed, it means that we need
context which has full rights to the system. So we should also set

can be done with such elevated context always.

It is needed e.g. when elevated context is used to get some data from

Tested modules import various other, often external,
modules as dependencies. With few exceptions these are
not needed during testing, and may in fact introduce
unwanted noise.

Furthermore, the imports have to be taken into account when
describing requirements of the package, in both *.spec files,
and in *requirements.txt files.

This can lead to dependency bloat and various issues
stemming from dependency mismanagement.

This patch replaces specific imported modules with instances
of MagicMock class, using sys.modules API.

The replacement is only in effect if the fakes submodule,
of the test module, is imported before the module introducing
mocked dependency.

This change fixes the idrac-wsman BIOS hardware interface
implementation's determination of the result of its factory_reset
cleaning/deploy step, and, on success, updating of the cached BIOS
settings to their defaults. It uses a deterministic means of identifying
when the reset has successfully completed and the default BIOS settings
are available to be read.

The time when the iDRAC last performed a system inventory is referred to
as Collect System Inventory on Restart (CSIOR). CSIOR updates the values
of BIOS settings that can be read from the iDRAC. The interface reads
the CSIOR and records it on the ironic bare metal node before requesting
the factory reset and rebooting the system to process the request.
Following the system reboot, the CSIOR is periodically read until its
value changes from its recorded value. If that occurs before the
configured amount of time has passed, the step succeeds and the cached
BIOS settings are updated. Otherwise, the step fails and the node is
placed in the failed state.

Do not inject public certificates in pacemaker bundles by means
of ""podman cp"", as this pauses the container for a short amount
of time and can make pacemaker operation fail during that time
window and impact cluster for no reason.

Keep ""podman cp"" for non-HA containers, as the freeze is short
and doesn't seem to impact podman monitoring anyway.

The new certificate injection only works for podman 1.9+, lower
version won't overwrite the existing certificate.

There has been one confirmed denial-of-service against the opendev
git servers due to an openstack-ansible deployment failing to
correctly use cached wheels from the repo server and instead clone
and build the source code for each openstack service on each target
host.

Whilst we wait for further information to understand the root cause
of that DOS, it is possible to adjust the user-agent that git uses
on a per-domain basis.

A previous patch [1] creates a user-agent string very early during
the setup of a deployment host, or all-in-one environment, but not
any other nodes in a multinode environment. This patch addresses
creating /etc/gitconfig for all hosts in a multinode environment.

If git is not installed on a host (which would be the default state
for hosts other than the deploy host and repo server) a placeholder
/etc/gitconfig is written in case later in the deployment the
python_venv_build role installs git and clones openstack services
from source code to install into a venv without use of the repo
server container. The repo server should normally clone once for
each service deployed for the whole environment.

The user-agent, where possible, contains the git version string,
the openstack-ansible version string and the OSA 'component' to
aid understanding traffic patterns seen at the opendev.org git servers.

This reverts commit f5a757b1065d26593bdf6fca55ed70772d5ff722.

Reason for revert: This breaks the upgrade path for helm2, the
secrets are deleted since they have changed and not recreated
upon upgrade.

Adding the pre-upgrade hook does not work as intended with helm2,
the problem was never fixed in helm2 due to it reaching EOL.

TripleO traditionally deploys the cinder-backup service to run
A/P (active/passive) under pacemaker, but cinder itself supports
running A/A. This patch adds deploy_steps_tasks to remove the
service from pcmk control (essentially deleting the pcs resource)
prior to deploying it as a regular containerized (non-pcmk) service.

A new cinder-backup-active-active.yaml environment file helps the
user clarify their intent. The legacy cinder-backup.yaml file
continues to deploy the service under pacemaker (to preserve the
default deployment behavior), but rather than encouraging users to
edit the file to switch deployment modes (as a comment in the file
used to advise), users can proactively deploy the A/A mode (or switch
from A/P to A/A) by including the new environment file.

that should be used when managing neutron Virtual IP
resources ""outside"" the overcloud Heat stack.

Add command to provision Virtual IPs using 'vip_data'
file as input. This command will output a

This is a backport of [1] but in between now and then the code in
tripleo_validation was move back into python-tripleoclient[2] and the
review in [1] was included.

This means that we cannot have a review in master as it's already

Updated _run_validator_run to no longer raise an execption if/when a group is empty

Using a log vs. exception is useful when we want to run an automated set of validations

While we switched the branch in use in master[1], for stable branches
it is better to pin it to a specific version to avoid issue caused by

This script triggers a restart of HAProxy when any keepalived
instance enters the fault state. This can cause an unnecessary
restart of HAProxy, dropping internal connections, if the external
instance fails.

An alternative approach would be to associate this notification
with the internal instance only, but given the nature of the
existing HAProxy liveness check and the use of systemd across all
deployments this appears to be covered by service restart policy.

We removed calls to configure the libvirt-based firewall driver in
'_create_guest_with_network' as part of change
I5a9e5532c46a5f7064441ae644125d21efe5fda1. Since then, there only other
way we can successfully create a guest and still end up in an exception
handler is if the plugging of VIFs fails. Despite this, all three code
paths still contained references to a 'guest' attribute that would never
be set.

Clarify things by removing the use of the 'guest' attribute from the
other code paths. This means the '_cleanup_failed_start' helper only has
one caller and some unnecessary logic itself, so we can fold that into
its caller. We also take this opportunity to remove an unnecessary
error handler - 'nova.exception.VirtualInterfaceCreateException' is
derived from 'Exception' and doesn't need its own handler - and add the
type hints for the function. The heavy lifting for the latter was
already done in change I2489bf16dabc8a83b2044139247f4245ae29adb1 so this
is pretty easy to grok.

Next up, we really need to stop passing around dicts of block device
mapping info, but that's another change for another day.

So you might want to isolate Trove from other services in terms of the RabbitMQ cluster, and use a standalone one. In order to deploy new RabbitMQ cluster and use it for Trove, you will need to: #. Create new group for RabbitMQ containers. You need to create file inside ``/etc/openstack_depoy/env.d`` which defines group mapping .. code-block:: yaml component_skel: trove_rabbitmq: belongs_to: - trove_mq_all container_skel: trove_rabbit_container: belongs_to: - trove-mq_containers contains: - trove_rabbitmq physical_skel: trove-mq_containers: belongs_to: - all_containers trove-mq_hosts: belongs_to: - hosts #. Define on which hosts this group will be deployed. This can be done either with new file in conf.d or inside openstack_user_config.yml .. code-block:: yaml trove-mq_hosts: aio1: ip: 172.29.236.100 #. Create overrides for dedicated rabbitmq containers, ie ``/etc/openstack_deploy/group_vars/trove_rabbitmq.yml`` .. code-block:: yaml rabbitmq_cluster_name: trove #. Create overrides for trove service contaienrs, ie ``/etc/openstack_deploy/group_vars/trove_all.yml`` .. code-block:: yaml rabbitmq_host_group: trove_rabbitmq #.

This patch switches the debian/ubuntu OS to build their lxc base
images locally using debootstrap rather than download a pre-built
lxc image. This unifies the approach with Centos-8 which is already
building a local image using dnf.

The LXC cache prestage tasks are removed, and all variables
associated with the download of the lxc image are removed from
defaults/main.yml.

A new variable lxc_apt_mirror is introduced, which is passed to
debootstrap to provide the apt source that the container rootfs
should be built from.

Commit 9f4369d9 added a feature to set the availability zone of
the nova-compute unit on the cloud-compute relation. This uses the
value of the JUJU_AVAILABILITY_ZONE environment variable, which is
not consistent with how the nova-compute service sets its availability
zone.

Use the nova_compute_utils.get_availability_zone() method instead.

TODO: well, this is not a patch to be merged because we cannot
      change the binaries to *-nft. We should provide an configuration
      option and, if possible, a migrating strategy.

This patch will make use of ""iptables-nft"" and all related commands.
That will make use of netfilter ""nftables"", replacing ""iptables"",
""ip6tables"", ""ebtables"" and ""arptables"".

Because ""ipset"" does not have a migrating tool, the code is entirely
migrated to nftables.

There is currently no way to separate out statsd settings per cloud.
While you can set a prefix other than 'openstack.api', this applies to
all clouds and groups all the stats together.

While this may be what you want, it may also be not what you want :)
For example in nodepool, we have multiple cloud providers who each
have their own grafana page, so we'd like them all to log themselves
to different stats buckets (i.e. set individual prefixes).

This allows setting a ""metrics"" field in each individual cloud entry
that overrides the global settings.  TBH I don't know if this is
important for InfluxDB as well, but I've implemented it for that too
for consistency.

Test cases are added for the global and merged settings.

I've also updated the documentation page a bit.  I've separated it
into subsections for the three types of stats available.  I removed
some of the in-depth stuff about logging types which wasn't that clear
(I think we can just present what we support and let people decide).

After a Overcloud deployment, /etc/hosts on the undercloud
will be populated with entries for each overcloud node. Since
we use the same tripleo_ansible roles for both the undercloud
and overcloud deployment, the /etc/hosts file on the Director
will be removed by undercloud install / upgrade operations.

This is outlined here:

This change adds the RootStackName to the group_vars,
this is then used by the tripleo_host_entries role in

In kernel 5.7+ a new virtual bus know as *vDPA* (vHost data path acceleration) was introduced to provide a vendoraccelerator implementations. vDPA support was introduced in Libvirt 6.9.0 to leverage the vDPA capabilities introduced in QEMU 5.1+.for offloading to hardware-based smart NICs via hardware offloaded OVS.in the guest to function. The vDPA bus allows an abstraction layer to exist between the accelerator and the VM without the CPU overhead of traditional software vHost implementations. vDPA-enabled vSwitch offloads allow While vDPA is expected to support live migration in the future, QEMU does not currently support live migration with vDPA devices. One of the main advantages of vDPA based networking over SR-IOV is the ability to abstract the device state from the VM, allowing transparent live migration via a software fallback. Until that fallback is implemented in QEMU, live migration will be blocked at the API layer via a HTTP 409 (Conflict) error response so that we can enable it without a new micro-version. As Open vSwitch is currently the only control plane capable of managing vDPA devices, and since that requires hardware offloads to function, this spec will focus on enabling vDPA networking exclusively with hardware-offloaded OVS. In a future release this functionality can be extended to other vSwitch implementations such as VPP or linux bridge if they become vDPA enabled.As an operator, I want to offer hardware-accelerated networking without requiring tenants to install vendor-specific drivers in their guests. As an operator, I want to leverage hardware-accelerated networking while Transparent live migration will not initially be supported and will be enabled only after it is supported officially in a future QEMU release.* A new vnic-type ``vdpa`` has been introduced to neutron to request vDPA offloaded networking. https://github.com/openstack/neutron-lib/commit/8c6ab5e * The ``nova.network.model`` class will be extended to define the new ``vdpa``* The PCI tracker will be extended with a new device-type, ``VDPA``. whitelisted and is bound to a vDPA driver, it will be inventoried as ``VDPA``. In the libvirt driver this will be done by extending the private ``_get_pci_passthrough_devices`` and ``_get_device_type`` functions to detect if a VF is a parent of a vDPA nodedev.

In kernel 5.7+ a new virtual bus know as the ``vDPA`` (vHost data path acceleration) was introduced to provide a vendoraccelerator implementations. In Libvirt 6.9.0 vDPA support was introduced to leverage the VDPA capabilities introduced in QEMU 5.1+.for offloading to hardware-based smart NICs via hardware offloaded ovs.in the guest to function. The vdpa bus allows an abstraction layer to exist between the accelerator and the vm without the cpu overhead of traditional software vHost implementations. VDPA enabled vswitch offloads allow While VDPA technically can support live migration in the future QEMU currently does not support live migration with VDPA devices. One of the main advantages of VDPA based networking over sriov is the ability to abstract the device state from the VM allowing transparent live migration via a software fallback. Until that fallback is implemented in QEMU, live migration will be blocked at the api via a HTTP 409 (Conflict) error response so that we can enable it without a new micro-version. As Open vSiwtch is currently the only control plane capable of managing VDPA devices and since that requires hardware offloads to function this spec will focus on enabling VDPA networking exclusively with hardware offloaded OVS. In a future release this functionality can be extended to other vswitch implementations such as VPP or linux bridge if they become VDPA enabled.As an operator, I want to offer hardware accelerated networking without requiring tenants to install vendor-specific drivers in the guest. As an operator, I want to leverage hardware accelerated networking while Transparent live migration will not initially be supported and will be enabled only after it is supported officially in a future QEMU release.* A new vnic-type vdpa has been introduced to neutron to request vdpa offloaded networking. https://github.com/openstack/neutron-lib/commit/8c6ab5e * The ``nova.network.model`` class will be extended to define the new vDPA* The PCI tracker will be extended with a new device-type ``type-VDPA``. whitelisted and is bound to a vdpa driver, it will be inventoried as type-VDPA. In the libvirt driver this will be done by extending the private _get_pci_passthrough_devices and _get_device_type functions to detect if a VF is a parent of a VDPA nodedev. these function are called via get_available_resources in the resource tracker to generate the resources dictionary consumed by _setup_pci_tracker at the start up of the compute agent in _init_compute_node. The vdpa device type is required to ensure that the VF associated with vDPA devices cannot be allocated to VMs via PCI alias or standard neutron SR-IOV support. VFs associated with VDPA devices cannot be managed using standard kernel control plane command such as ip tools, as a result allocating them to an interface managed by the ``sriov-nic-agent`` or via alias based PCI pass-through is not valid.

This commit adds a new configuration option `default_branch`, which is
used to specify the default/base branch a repository is using.
Previously reno assumed the default branch was always named 'master'
which causes commands such as 'reno lint' to fail when it is run on a
repository that uses a different default branch name such as 'main'.
This config option gives users an option to specify which branch should
be used for cases like that.

This was fixed in libvirt-6.10.0-1.
Which means, once you're using libvirt-6.10.0-1 or higher, a client

If we simply create the client certificate, this will fix live-migration

As stated in the official ansible docs[0]:

When running fetch with become, the slurp module will also
be used to fetch the contents of the file for determining
the remote checksum. This effectively doubles the transfer
size, and depending on the file size can consume all available
memory on the remote or local hosts causing a MemoryError.
Due to this it is advisable to run this module without become
whenever possible.

This is mostly problematic when transfering big files and the
/var/lib/mysql folder tends to be big in long deployments.

This patch removes the become from the fetch task and changes
the archive permissions before the fetch in order to make it
possible. To cover this functionality a new test is added
huge_file which creates a 10G file in the source container,
as well as updates some molecule specific parameters which
were outdated.

TLS client verification used to be accidentally disabled in libvirt.
This was fixed in libvirt-6.10.0-1.
Which means, once you're using libvirt-6.10.0-1 or higher, a client
certificate is mandatory during live migration with TLS.

If we simply create the client certificate, this will fix live-migration
of newly created instance but will not fix already created instances.

This change will allow us to keep client certificate validation disabled
during the train release cycle and re-enable it from Wallaby and onward.

TLS client verification used to be accidentally disabled in libvirt.
This was fixed in libvirt-6.10.0-1.
Which means, once you're using libvirt-6.10.0-1 or higher, a client
certificate is mandatory during live migration with TLS.

If we simply create the client certificate, this will fix live-migration
of newly created instance but will not fix already created instances.

This change will allow us to keep client certificate validation disabled

Keystone's update_user() method in the SQL driver processes a lot of
information about how to update users. This includes evaluating password
logic and authentication attempts for PSI-DSS. This logic is evaluated
after keystone pulls the user record from SQL and before it exits the
context manager, which performs the write.

When multiple clients are all updating the same user reference, it's
more likely they will see an HTTP 500 because of race conditions exiting
the context manager. The HTTP 500 is due to stale data when updating
password expiration for old passwords, which happens when setting a new
password for a user.

This commit attempts to handle that case more gracefully than throwing a
500 by detecting StaleDataErrors from sqlalchemy and retrying.  The
identity sql backend will retry the request for clients that have
stale data change from underneath them.

using neutron from the last stable release instead of master.
So this patch sets explicitly master branch to be used.

With this change a Heat resource is no longer used to
create an undercloud neutron API port resource for the
redis and ovn_dbs service virtual IPs. Instead an
external deploy task at step 0 in the individual service
template uses the ""tripleo_service_vip"" ansible module
to mange a neutron API port resource for each service.

The interfaces to control the IP address and service
network (RedisVirtualFixedIPs, OVNDBsVirtualFixedIPs
and ServiceNetMap) remains the same.

It is also possible to include the 'use_neutron' boolean
in the FixedIPs parameter to instruct the ansible module
not to create a neutron API resource, and simply ""echo""
the ip_address given in the FixedIPs parameter. For
example:
  RedisVirtualFixedIPs:
    - ip_address: 1.0.0.5
      use_neutron: false

Alternatively the fixed-ips can be set using the
'ServiceVips' parameter, like this:

 ServiceVips:
   redis: 1.0.0.5
   ovs_dbs: 1.0.0.6

NOTE: If the neutron service is not available the
      tripleo_service_vip ansible module will ""echo""
      the IP provided in %service%VirtualFixedIPs.

Now that we have object audit watchers, let's have the ability to create
database audit watcher. That is account and container watchers.

Instead of a see_object, db watchers have a see_broker(broker).

There is also a very experimental bucket inventory container watcher
that by defaults puts the inventory in an object called .inventory in
the said container. On sharded containers this will be an SLO (once I
get it working). This inventory is just a json-ifyed version of the

The multipart document handling in the proxy is consumed via iteration,
but the error handling code is not consistent with how it applies
conversions of IO errors/timeouts and retry failures to StopIteration.

In an effort to make the code more obvious and easier to debug and
maintain I've added comments and additional tests as well as tightening
up StopIteration exception handling.

Manila's CephFS driver that we're testing
in scenario004 started supporting
snapshots and snapshot cloning, and our
tempest opts are incompatible.

Since tempestconf has a way to detect
the right options, lets stop overriding
in the job definitions.

Periodic RDO jobs will need to be fixed
in the same manner.

There have been problems with centos7 lately with py2/py3.
Ansible's pip module used python2 instead of python3 for
creating virtual venv which lead to dependency issues with
infrared which should be installed only by py3.

This changes also bumps the linters, removing yamllint which is now
included in ansible-lint.

The associated bug is due to a change introduced in commit d55dcde
which was to ensure that the correct password update is used for
different versions of mysql (pre and post 5.7.5).  However, this change
has broken the nagios user creation due to not setting the password.

This patch creates the nagios user and passord at the same time.  The
updating of the password is only done if the account already exists.

The change also corrects the nagios password store in leader-settings to
the 'mysql-nagios.passwd' key instead of 'nagios-password'.  This was an
unfortuante error when the nagios change password was introduced.  The
charm detects if the 'nagios-password' key is used on charm-upgrade and
moves it to 'mysql-nagios.passwd'.  This enables the key to work with
the standard MySQLHelper functions.

Finally, the ALTER command (on percona) doesn't update non-InnoDB tables
and thus needs to be run for each unit when the nagios password is
changed via the action.  The changes in percona_utils.py enable this to
happen.

Whilst the change looks large it ONLY affects the nagios password parts
of the charm.

The related bug is a tracking bug to serve as a reminder to fix this in
charm-helpers and this charm (i.e. make the charm-helpers code work to
change a password for any user other than root, and then enable this
charm to use that code).

TLS client verification used to be accidentally disabled in libvirt.
This was fixed in libvirt-6.10.0-1.
Which means, once you're using libvirt-6.10.0-1 or higher, a client
certificate is mandatory during live migration with TLS.

If we simply create the client certificate, this will fix live-migration
of newly created instance but will not fix already created instances.

This change will allow us to keep client certificate validation disabled
during the train release cycle and re-enable it from Wallaby and onward.

If docker_configure_for_zun is set to true, then Zun-specific
configuration for Docker is applied to all nodes. It should only be
applied based on the relevant inventory groups. In some cases this can
cause Docker to fail to start. See
https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2008544 for details.

This change applies the configuration based on the zun-compute and
zun-cni-daemon groups. It also modifies the expression to not assume
that these groups exist in the inventory.

This patch removes reference to TripleO packages.

It also brings a better testing coverage through Molecule.

This patch also refactors the module itself, so it now process
the packages in one go, and reports results to ansible.

Futhermore, validation will now check for appropriate package
arhchitecture, instead of assuming they are all the same.

Validation now also determines the package manager itself,
assuming it isn't provided one by ansible.
Default fact gathering is thus no longer needed,
potentially saving storage and improving performance.

We are seeing an error raised by older Neutron's

 400: Client Error for url: <cloud>/v2.0/security-group-rules,
 Unrecognized attribute(s) 'remote_address_group_id'

This field was added unconditionally with
I50374c339ab7685a6e74f25f9521b8810c532e13 but, per above, appears to
cause problems for older Neutron instances.

To work around this, remove the argument from the body when blank by
overriding the _prepare_request function of SecurityGroupRule.

Two tests where this are used are updated; one checks the body is not
sent when None and the other is modified to send a
remote_address_group_id value to validate the other path.

default_tls_verify

TLS client verification used to be accidentally disabled in libvirt.
This was fixed in libvirt-6.10.0-1.
Which means, once you're using libvirt-6.10.0-1 or higher, a client
certificate is mandatory during live migration with TLS.

If we simply create the client certificate, this will fix live-migration
of newly created instance but will not fix already created instances.

This change will allow us to keep client certificate validation disabled
during the train release cycle and re-enable it from Wallaby and onward.

This information will beYou should monitor the provisioning status of a load balancer, and send alerts if the provisioning status is not ACTIVE. Alerts should not be triggered when an application is making regular changes to the pool and enters several PENDING stages. The provisioning status of load balancer objects reflect the status of the control plane being able to contact and successfully provision a create, update, and delete request. The operating status of a load balancer object reports on the current functional status of the load balancer. For example, a load balancer might have a provisioning status of ERROR, but an operating status of ONLINE. This could be caused by a neutron networking failure that blocked that last requested update to the load balancer configuration from successfully completing. In this case the load balancer is continuing to process traffic through the load balancer, but might not have applied the latest configuration updates yet.You can monitor the operational status of your load balancer using the `openstack loadbalancer status show` command. It reports the current operation status of the load balancer and its child objects. You might also want to use an external monitoring service that connects to your load balancer listeners and monitors them from outside of the cloud. This type of monitoring indicates if there is a failure outside of Octavia that might impact the functionality of your load balancer, such as router failures, network connectivity issues, and so on.components in each of the three availability zones even if you lose a whole zone Octavia not to notice a stale amphora (the default configuration is 60s).

Alternatively, the monitoring of the other services showed problems as well, so depending on your overall monitoring strategy this might be optional.application to determine the health of members. This information will beFor critical applications, we recommend to monitor the access to the application with a tool which polls the application from various points on the Internet and measures response times. Alerts should be triggered when response times become too high. An additional check might be to monitor the provisioning status of a load balancer (see `Load Balance Status Codes <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/load-balancer/v2/#status-codes>`_) and alert depending on the application if the provisioning status is not ACTIVE. For some applications other states might not lead to alerts: For instance if an application is making regular changes to the pool several PENDING stages should not alert as well. In most cases, when a load balancer is in states other than ACTIVE it will still be passing traffic, which is why the response time check mentioned above is recommended. However, even if the load balancer is still functioning, it is advisable to investigate and potentially recreate it if it is stuck in a non-ACTIVE state.For production sites we recommend to use outside monitoring services. They will use servers distributed around the globe to not only monitor if the site is up but also parts of the system outside the visibility of Octavia like routers, network connectivity, etc.components in three availability zones even if you lose a whole zoneOctavia not to notice a stale amphora (the default configuration is 60s).",34,30

During the VM booting process Nova asks Neutron for the security groups
of the project. If there are no any fields specified, Neutron will
prepare list of security groups with all fields, including rules.
In case if project got many SGs, it may take long time as rules needs to
be loaded separately for each SG on Neutron's side.

During booting of the VM, Nova really needs only ""id"" and ""name"" of the

Pylint raises E1120 on all many of our migrations because the insert
call is missing the dml parameter:

  E1120: No value for argument 'dml' in method call

The dml parameter is automatically added by sqlalchemy using a
decorator, like this:

This patch adds the decorator to the pyling configured

Ceph does not support erasure coded pools for rbd-mirroring.
Unfortunately, ceph does not provide an easy way to determine if a
metadata pool is used for an erasure coded rbd pool. This adds
information to the CephBrokerRequest when creating a pool to explicitly
request an rbd_mirroring_mode of 'none' to indicate that rbd mirroring
should not be enabled.

Following the pattern of other cinder backends, a new

adds support for configuring cinder RBD backends associated with

Nova vnc configuration right now uses NovaVncProxyNetwork,
NovaLibvirtNetwork and NovaApiNetwork to configure the different
components (novnc proxy, nova-compute and libvirt) for vnc.
If one of the networks get changed from internal_api, the service
configuration between libvirt, nova-compute and novnc proxy gets
inconsistent and the console is broken.
This changed to just use NovaLibvirtNetwork for configuring the vnc
endpoints and removes NovaVncProxyNetwork completely.

Added the optional parameter `cert` to both get_server_version
get_highest_client_server_version and methods so that users can have
the option to pass client certificates while fetching server versions.

Also support passing mTLS certificate/key to HTTPClient

Currently if the baremetal boot mode is unknown and the driver doesn't
support setting the boot mode then the error is logged and deployment
continues.

However if the BMC doesn't support getting or setting the boot mode
then setting the boot mode raises an error which results in the deploy
failing. This is the case for HPE Gen9 baremetal, which doesn't have a
'BootSourceOverrideMode' attribute in its system Boot field, and
raises a 400 iLO.2.14.UnsupportedOperation in response to setting the
boot mode.

This is raised from set_boot_mode as a RedfishError. This change
raises UnsupportedDriverExtension exception when the 'mode' attribute
is missing from the 'boot' field, allowing the deployment to continue.

As per the community goal of migrating the policy file
the format from JSON to YAML[1], we need to do two things:

1. Change the default value of '[oslo_policy] policy_file''
config option from 'policy.json' to 'policy.yaml' with
upgrade checks.

2. Deprecate the JSON formatted policy file on the project side
via warning in doc and releasenotes.

Also replace policy.json to policy.yaml ref from doc and tests.
