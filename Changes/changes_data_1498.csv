This option is set to true by default in Neutron but it should be
disabled in case when OVN backend is used.
It should be enabled only when ""traditional"" dhcp agents are used in
Neutron.
As OVN is default Neutron backend in the Tripleo, this patch sets
DhcpAgentNotification option to be False by default and enables it only
when neutron-dhcp-agent is going to be deployed.

It looks like something in one of Tox's install phases other than
the deps install phase depends on dnspython, which is resulting in
installing a version of it that doesn't match what's set in upper
constraints. Tox relies on the install_command option, if specified,
to tell it how it should handle installation in all of its phases,
so add the constraints option there in order to make sure it's
applied consistently.

This became apparent because dnspython recently released version
2.3.0 which doesn't work with Eventlet, but chances are we've not
been testing with constrained dnspython (and other packages
installed outside the deps phase) long before that bug brought it to
our attention.

While updating an image using ``glance image-update``,

replace tags.
``[{""op"": ""replace"", ""path"": ""/name"", ""value"": ""Image""},

The request should only contain replace property.

This occurs for images having tags associated to it.
The ``glance image-update`` does not update the tag

To avoid the constraints mismatch on stable branch testing which can
happen in future also, let's use it from pypi version which will be the

Also, remove basepython/ignore_basepython_conflict from tox.ini. Tox 4.2.6
still failing with the missing interpreter for [testenv:functional{,-py38,

This patch removes basepython = python3 assuming that developers already
switched for python3 in their environment as python2.7 is EOL.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================================== [OVN] - IPv6 Distributed routing ==================================== RFE: https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1998609 This RFE intends to implement distributed routing support for IPv6 only or dual-stack usage scenarios. Distributed routing is already a reality for IPv4 addresses and the benefits of implementing DVR for IPv6 are the same as for IPv4. Problem Description =================== When we are using an IPv6 only or dual-stack deployment, the traffic for IPv6 addresses remains centralized by the gateway port of the router. DVR support for IPv4 FIP addresses has already implemented in neutron using the enable_distributed_floating_ip flag in the [ovn] section - ml2_conf.ini file. This issue affects both End Users and Deployers: * For End Users - (Network performance) Since traffic is centralized, all network applications need to go through the gw router port chassis resident <-> compute node (via tunneling - e.g. geneve) before reaching the endpoint. In case the gw router port is on the same chassis as the VM compute node, this is not applicable. * For Deployers - (Additional settings for dynamic routing) As the IPv6 GUA subnet is associated behind the router's gw port, it is necessary to advertise this subnet dynamically to the border network element (which routes the external/internal traffic of IPv6 prefixes). It could be statically, but it is not feasible when we talk about large scale deployments. So, we need to enable additional settings like BGP with the neutron-dynamic-routing, for example. If the compute node where the VM is running knows the path to send packets to external networks (with the help of routing protocols configured on each compute node, e.g. using FRR), outgoing traffic may work directly to the border. However, the incoming traffic will always be forwarded to the router's gw port, as he is the only one who knows how to respond the Neighbor Solicitation to the IPv6 GUA address of the VM. DVR Use case: * The provider networks must be stretched over the Underlay Network and each Compute Node would have the bridge for external traffic. In an L3 Leaf-Spine Underlay, for example, the network to be reached is for the Underlay Network be able to stretch an L2 domain(VLAN) via VXLAN as dataplane and BGP EVPN as Control Plane. In this solution, the Leaf switches would need to work as HW VTEP Gateway to initiate and terminate the VXLANs tunnels and use BGP EVPN to learn and advertise the MAC Addresses from the Compute Node's provider network. - E/W PATH: Compute Node VM <-> OVS br-int <-> br-provider <-> external-bridge-mapping <-> FRR <-> BGP EVPN type2 <-> E/W spine/leaf <-> [reverse flow to VM] - N/S PATH: Compute Node VM <-> OVS br-int <-> br-provider <-> external-bridge-mapping <-> FRR <-> BGP EVPN type2 <-> N/S Border Leaf <-> external network Proposed Change =============== To solve the problem described above, the proposal is to introduce a new NAT rule for the IPv6 GUA addresses that are allocated to VMs (ovn/ovs understands IPv6 GUA like a FIP). Even though it is a global address, the ovn-controller running on the chassis needs this rule to start responding Neighbor Advertisements for IPv6 just like it does with GARPs for IPv4 FIP's. To enable the IPv6 DVR NAT rule management, a new config option should be enabled via [ovn] section in ml2_conf.ini file. * ``enable_distributed_ipv6 = True`` This option is similar to a configuration option to enable DVR for FIP's: enable_distributed_floating_ip. OVN/OVS Impact ------------------- The OVN support the distributed routing for IPv6 GUA with the same idea of the IPv4 case [1]. For the ovn controller, the external_ip and local_ip can contain IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. Therefore, the contract rule for creating the IPv6 NAT rule remains the same used for FIP Ipv4 addresses: NAT rule fields (OVN): type : dnat_and_snat logical_ip : The same VM IPv6 GUA address external_ip : The same VM IPv6 GUA address logical_port: VM logical port external_ids: Managed by Neutron external_mac: VM MAC address The external_ip and logical_ip used in the NAT rule are the same (e.g. VM GUA). With this entry, the ovn should add logical flows to respond to IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation requests for the IPv6 GUA directly by ovn-controller on the chassis where the VM resides. We know that there is no NAT for IPv6, so this special rule that translates the GUA address to itself is only used to create the flows in the chassis where the VM resides. Without this rule, the compute node does not know how to respond to that IPv6 GUA and centralize the communication through the router's GW port (via geveve tunnel if the router resides on another host). Neutron Impact --------------------- The NAT rules for FIP Ipv4 are managed by Neutron floating ips database. In the case of the NAT rule for IPv6 GUA addresses, we need to create a ""fake translation rule"" for the address associated with a VM. IPv6 addresses are allocated to VMs during port creation and managed via ipv6_address_mode (static, SLAAC, DHCPv6 Stateful, or DHCPv6 Stateless). This means that port creation and deletion events manage IPv6 addresses and MAC addresses allocated to a VM. In this case, the creation of the NAT rule for IPv6 GUA can follow the port creation and deletion process provided by ovn_client in the OVN driver. The port structure provides the IPv6 address (subnet), the VM MAC address, and the logical_port but to create a NAT rule it is necessary to allocate this rule to the router, being necessary to search for the id of the router associated with the port of the VM. IPv6 GUA NAT rule creation: { args = {'type': 'dnat_and_snat', 'logical_ip': IPv6_ADDRESS, 'external_ip': IPv6_ADDRESS, 'logical_port': PORT_ID, 'external_ids': EXTERNAL_IDS, 'external_mac': EXTERNAL_MAC} _nb_idl.add_nat_rule_in_lrouter(gw_lrouter_name, args) } IPv6 GUA NAT rule deletion: { args = {'type': 'dnat_and_snat', 'logical_ip': IPv6_ADDRESS, 'external_ip': IPv6_ADDRESS} _nb_idl.delete_nat_rule_in_lrouter(gw_lrouter_name, args) } * external_ids For IPV4 FIP NAT rules, the external_ids has important fields such as the fip_key, for example, but for IPv6 the external_ids information is not relevant. So, we can set common port information in that field to keep tracking. { ext_ids = OVN_PORT_EXT_ID_KEY, OVN_DEVID_EXT_ID_KEY, OVN_NETWORK_NAME_EXT_ID_KEY, OVN_ROUTER_NAME_EXT_ID_KEY} } FIP Impact --------------- Until now, the only NAT rule of type 'dnat_and_snat' was used exclusively for FIP's, therefore, the functions that search the ovn database for NAT rules of type 'dnat_and_snat', need to filter for exclusive FIP rules. One idea would be to create a new constant in external_ids to set the IP version, but it might be enough just to look for rules that have the OVN_FIP_EXT_ID_KEY fieldset. The change in neutron ovn NAT lookup for FIP's may require changes in existing tests for floating ips. DB Impact --------------- No new column entries or tables are needed to implement this RFE. IPv6 and MAC address information is already recorded on ports associated with VMs. However, to ensure consistency of information between neutron and ovn, it is necessary to implement a check for IPv6 NAT rules during ovn_db_sync. For VMs already created before enabling 'enable_distributed_ipv6' flag, neutron will notify in the log about the config differences when it is restarted. The NAT rules for IPv6 GUA will be automatically added or removed when executing a SYNC_MODE_REPAIR. Assignee(s) ----------- * Roberto Acosta <rbartzen@gmail.com> References ========== ..

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ======================================================= Strict minimum bandwidth support for tunnelled networks ======================================================= Launchpad bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1998608 The aim of the RFE is to create a tool to perform generic tasks in the compute nodes when using ML2/OVN. Problem Description =================== ML2/OVN is a mechanism driver that doesn't have backend agents. This mechanism driver exposes two agent types: the OVN controller agent and the metadata agent. The OVN controller agent is a representation of the status of the ovn-controller service on the node; the metadata agent is the service that provides the metadata to the virtual machines. However the ML2/OVN mechanism driver does not have an agent to perform the local Open vSwitch service configuration as in ML2/OVS, with extension drivers (like QoS or Trunk). The ovn-controller reads the OVN Southbound database to configure the local OVS database. The lack of an agent running on the local node, owned by Neutron, prevents us from implementing some functionalities currently not supported by OVN nor the drivers. For example, an this will be the first feature that the OVN monitor will implement, hardware offloaded ports cannot apply the OVS QoS rules due to limitations in the drivers. Proposed Change =============== This RFE proposes to create a generic agent running on the compute node. This agent will be called ""OVN monitor"". The execution of this monitor is discretionary and will be needed only if the specific features implemented on it are requested in a particular compute node. In other words, initially this service will be needed if a compute node has hardware offloaded ports and QoS is needed (new features could be implemented in the future). Unless other mechanism driver agents (like in ML2/OVS or ML2/SRIOV), this agent does not implement an RPC client. The information required to work will be retrieved from the local OVS database, the OVN Northbound database and the OVN Southbound database. QoS for hardware offloaded ports -------------------------------- The first feature that will be implemented within this agent is the QoS extension for hardware offloaded ports. Because of the current drivers limitations, these ports cannot be properly configured with the current QoS rules. This RFE proposes to use the corresponding ""ip-link"" [1]_ commands (or their ""pyroute2"" equivalents) to configure the port representor virtual function rates (maximum and minimum). This is similar to what is done in ML2/SRIOV for a virtual function (VF). A port representor (or a devlink port [2]_) is an API to expose the device information; it is not a physical port but a representative of a hardware port. The devlink port is connected to the local OVS switch; using the ""devlink"" tool (or the ""pyroute2"" equivalent), it is possible to retrieve the port information, including the physical function (PF) PCI address. E.g.:: $ devlink port show enp4s0f1_5 -jp ""port"": { ""pci/0000:04:00.1/65542"": { ""type"": ""eth"", ""netdev"": ""enp4s0f1_5"", ""flavour"": ""pcivf"", ""pfnum"": 1, ""vfnum"": 5, ""splittable"": false, ""function"": { ""hw_addr"": ""fa:16:3e:f8:7b:10"" } } } With the PF PCI address, it is possible to retrieve the PF name, that will be stored in:: $ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/$pf_pci_address/net Using the ML2/SRIOV class ``PciDeviceIPWrapper``, it is possible to set the maximum and minimum rates of a VF, knowing the VF index and the PF name. OVN QoS information location ---------------------------- The OVN QoS information is stored in two different places (due to how QoS is currently implemented in ML2/OVN and core OVN): * The maximum bandwidth and maximum burst limits are stored in the ""Qos:rate"" dictionary:: $ ovn-nbctl list Qos _uuid : 376303c4-5290-4c4e-a489-d35894315199 action : {} bandwidth : {rate=1000, burst=800} direction : to-lport external_ids : {""neutron:port_id""=""89a81cc0-7b3e-473d-8c01-2539cf2a9a6a""} match : ""outport == \""89a81cc0-7b3e-473d-8c01-2539cf2a9a6a\"""" priority : 2002 * The minimum bandwidth rate is stored in the ""Logical_Switch_Port:options"" dictionary:: $ ovn-nbctl list Logical_Switch_Port _uuid : 502b3852-4a46-4fcb-9b49-03063cfc0b34 addresses : [""fa:16:3e:c4:b8:29 10.0.0.8""] dhcpv4_options : a7e4cfb1-ef22-490a-9ffe-fea04de3fe1c dhcpv6_options : [] dynamic_addresses : [] enabled : true external_ids : {...(skipped)} ha_chassis_group : [] name : ""e6808371-c9ac-4015-94a3-7f16ac3fbb2d"" options : {mcast_flood_reports=""true"", qos_min_rate=""1000"", requested-chassis=u20ovn} parent_name : [] port_security : [""fa:16:3e:c4:b8:29 10.0.0.8""] tag : [] tag_request : [] type : """" up : true OVN QoS events -------------- The hardware offloaded QoS extension will configure the QoS setting on a port reacting to the following events (please check the working POC [3]_ for more information): * The local OVS interface creation: with this event, the OVN monitor will store what ports are bound to the local instance. It will store the Neutron port ID (stored in the ""Interface.external_ids:iface-id"" string) and the OVS port name. * The local OVS interface deletion: this event will trigger the QoS reset and the interface local cache deletion. * The OVN Southbound ""Port_Binding"" creation event: this event is received after a port is created in a local OVS. If this event is received, that will trigger the QoS update of the local port. It's worth mentioning that this event happens always after the local OVS interface creation; that means the OVN monitor has already registered that this port is bound locally. * The OVN Northbound ""Logical_Switch_Port"" register change: if minimum bandwidth of a locally bound LSP changes, this event triggers the QoS update. * The OVN Northbound ""QoS"" register change: similar to the previous one but affecting the maximum bandwidth limit. REST API Impact --------------- This RFE does not introduce any API change. Data Model Impact ----------------- This RFE does not introduce any model change. Security Impact --------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ Each monitor will have a connection to the local OVS database and the remotes OVN Northbound and Southbound databases. The connection to the remove OVN databases can have a severe impact on the load of the OVN database node (that are usually the OpenStack controllers). This initial implementation will subscribe to the following tables:: Northbound: QoS, Logical_Switch_Port and Logical_Switch Southbound: Chassis, Encap, Port_Binding, Datapath_Binding and SB_Global Other Impact ------------ None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignees: Rodolfo Alonso Hernandez <ralonsoh@redhat.com> (IRC: ralonsoh) Work Items ---------- * OVN monitor implementation and the hardware offloaded QoS extension. * Tests and CI related changes. Testing ======= * Unit/functional tests. .. NOTE:: The hardware offloaded QoS extension requires specific hardware to test this feature. Currently is not possible to implement any tempest test on the CI. Documentation Impact ==================== User Documentation ------------------ * Information about how to configure and spawn the OVN monitor. * Information about the hardware offloaded QoS extension.

tox4 even when running specific env with -e option tries
to find python version for all envs defined in envlist[1]
when running with --skip-missing-interpreters=false and
fails if interpreter missing for any of the env.

With py38 in envlist it tries to find python3.8
which is not available in ubuntu-jammy by default
and fails, hence use generic version instead i.e py3
to handle it.

Even though [1] is fixed we are still seeing this failure.

On a recent change [1], some additional checks was added to avoid
ports overlapping cidrs on a router. On this change was also added
a check to do not attach more than one port IPv6 from same network,
but this check need to allow multiple ports when a deployment is
done using ml2/ovs+xvlan+dvr and the router has an external gateway
configured, because two ports are added:

- one with device_owner as network:router_interface_distributed
- another one with device_owner as network:router_centralized_snat

Also an small improvement is done for just run this check over the
existing ports on the router for the same network_id.

Support for the human format by oslo_utils.imageutils.QemuImgInfo was
deprecated since oslo.utils 4.9.1 [1]. This change replaces the human
format with the json format which will be used by default.

Backport note: The json format is preferable because it allows access
to format specific details (since oslo.utils 4.1.0).  These details
are not present when the default 'human' format is used.  See change

In Linuxbridge and OVS PortFixture, when port is created, in the fake
vm's namespace it needs to have correct mac address configured.
It seems that for some reason it's not properly configured sometimes and
that may cause failure of e.g. DHCP tests.
So this patch adds retries for 10 seconds to ensure that MAC address is

A combination of durable queues and classic queue mirroring can be used
to provide high availability of RabbitMQ. However, these options should
only be used together, otherwise the system will become unstable. Using
the flag ``om_enable_rabbitmq_high_availability`` will either enable
both options at once, or neither of them.

There are some queues that should not be mirrored:
* ``reply`` queues (these have a single consumer and TTL policy)
* ``fanout`` queues (these have a TTL policy)
* ``amq`` queues (these are auto-delete queues, with a single consumer)
An exclusionary pattern is used in the classic mirroring policy. This
pattern is ``^(?!(amq\\.)|(.*_fanout_)|(reply_)).*``

This transition the Queens branch to End of Life. The last patch of the

cannot be used anymore and will be deleted if this patch merges.

This is needed as stable/queens is not actively maintained in the recent

by removing these branches, infra resources will be freed up, too.

Please try to identify any zuul job, that is defined outside of the

This commit changes the os-reset_status group-snapshot-api

1.reset a group-snapshot to the 'deleting' or 'error_deleting'
status is now disallowed

NOTE: with this change, some requests that previously succeeded will
return a 400.  However, these were requests that would leave a resource
in an inconsistent state with an inaccurate status, so a 400 is
appropriate.  We use a 400 (not 409) to be consistent with the current
Block Storage API. This change is not microversioned because it doesn't
make sense to only prevent operators from shooting themselves in the
foot if they happen to specify an appropriate microversion,
and be grievously wounded otherwise.

The nvmet target was using the nvmetcli command to manage the NVMe-oF
targets, but the command has a big limitation when it comes to
controlling it's behaviour through the command line, as it can only
restore all its configuration and small parts, such as ports or
subsystems, cannot be directly modified without entering into the
interactive mode.

Due to this limitation the nvmet target would:

- Save current nvmet configuration
- Make changes to the json data
- Restore the updated configuration

The problem with this process, besides being slow because it runs a CLI
command and uses temporary files, is that the restoration completely
deletes EVERYTHING, before recreating it again.  This means that all
hosts that are connected to volumes will suddenly experience a
disconnect to the volumes (because the namespace and subsystems have
disappeared) and will keep retrying to connect.  The reconnect succeeds
after the configuration has been restored by nvmet, but that's 10 to 20
seconds that hosts cannot access volumes (this may block things in VMs)
and will present nnvme kernel log error messages.

To fix all these issues, speed and disconnect, this patch stops using
the nvmetcli as a CLI and uses it as a Python library, since that's the
most feature rich functionality of nvmetcli.

Querying the nvmet system can be done directly with the library, but to
make changes (create/destroy ports, subsystems, namespaces) it requires
privileges, so this patch adds a privsep wrapper for the operations that
we use and cannot be done as a normal user.

The nvmet wrapper doesn't provide privsep support for ALL operations,
only for those that we currently use.

Due to the client-server architecture of privsep and nvmet using non
primitive instances as parameters, the privsep wrapper needs custom
serialization code to pass these instances.

As a side effect of the refactoring we also fix a bug were we tried to
create the port over and over again on each create_export call which
resulted in nvme kernel warning logs.

On a recent change [1], some additional checks was added to avoid
ports overlapping cidrs on a router. On this change was also added
a check to do not attach more than one port IPv6 from same network,
but this check need to allow multiple ports when a deployment is
done using ml2/ovs+xvlan+dvr and the router has an external gateway
configured, because two ports are added:

- one with device_owner as network:router_interface_distributed
- another one with device_owner as network:router_centralized_snat

Also an small improvement is done for just run this check over the
existing ports on the router for the same network_id.

Created new add_ip_addresses privileged function

take on additional priv overhead when calling

For parity, performed the same change on the

Availability zone doc page [1] mentioned that server moving
operation (evacuate/live-migrate) request can force target host
and bypass scheduler.

This support of forcing target host for evacuate/live-migrate
request was removed in [2].

This change updates the doc page by mentioning that it was possible
to force a host with older API microversion and how to use it, if
user wants to force target host for evacuate/live-migrate.

Only evacuate and live migrate can forcefully bypass the scheduler and move a server to a specified host and even then it is highly recommended to *not* force and bypass the scheduler.Knowing this, it is dangerous to force a server to another host with evacuate or live migrate if the server is restricted to a zone and is then forced to move to a host in another zone, because that will create an inconsistency in the internal tracking of where that server should live and may require manually updating the database for that server. For example, if a user creates a server in zone A and then the admin force live migrates the server to zone B, and then the user resizes the server, the scheduler will try to move it back to zone A which may or may not work, e.g. if the admin deleted or renamed zone A in the interim.

The previous `getattr(old, 'nb_cfg', False)` would evaluate to `False`
if the `old` row either did not contain a `nb_cfg` value or if the value
was 0.

As 0 is the value set on startup of the ovn-controller this causes the
neutron-api to ignore any event a ovn-controller directly sends after
startup. In turn this causes us to miss the information that the agent
is synchronized, causing the agent to appear as down, until something
bumps the `nb_cfg` value globally.

This option is set to true by default in Neutron but it should be
disabled in case when OVN backend is used.
It should be enabled only when ""traditional"" dhcp agents are used in
Neutron.
As OVN is default Neutron backend in the Tripleo, this patch sets
DhcpAgentNotification option to be False by default and enables it only
when neutron-dhcp-agent is going to be deployed.

This patch adds support for QoS minimum bandwidth rules in tunnelled
networks. Now the ML2/OVS and ML2/OVN mechanism drivers can represent
in the Placement API the available bandwidth of the tunnelled networks
in each compute host.

Both mechanism drivers represent the compute VTEP (VXLAN) or TEP
(Geneve) interface as an IP address. This new resource provider
(by default called ""rp_tunnelled"") represents the available bandwidth
of this interface. Any new port created in a compute node that belongs
to a tunnelled network, will request to the Placement API the
corresponding bandwidth from the resource provider inventory.

This patch does not provide backend enforcement support for minimum
bandwidth rules.

The rbd backend implementation of glance_store requires not only
python3-rbd but also python3-rados. In CentOS the python3-rados package
is installed as a dependency of python3-rbd, but in Debian and Ubuntu
that dependency is not defined and we should install python3-rados
explicitly.

This fixes the missing python3-rados package in Ubuntu, by using
the meta python3-ceph package which installs all python libraries.

This change introduces the new flag to disable the separate Ceph
repository. This is now required to migrate Ubuntu job to Jammy,
because the upstream ceph repository does not provide the packages

When networks are created using REST APIs, if the MTU isn't specified
in the request, then a default value of 0 is used. Some use cases, such
as the auto-allocated-topology workflow, call the plugin directly to
create networks, bypassing the layer that inserts this default value.
Commit 68625686a40b3eb75502c8116f23d2297e288ca1 introduced a different
default value at the DB layer, defined by a constant in neutron-lib.
If the maximum MTU size has been configured lower than this constant,
then the user receives an exception, even though they didn't provide
a value for MTU.

This patch changes the default value used in the DB layer, so that
it's consistent with the workflow seen via REST APIs.

keystoneclient Session expects as cert argument, one of the followings:
 * None (no client certificate),
 * a path to client certificate,

The change updates manilaclient code to support the last case (ie:

tox4 even when running specific env with -e option tries
to find python version for all envs defined in envlist[1]
when running with --skip-missing-interpreters=false and
fails if interpreter missing for any of the env.

With py38 in envlist it tries to find python3.8
which is not available in ubuntu-jammy by default
and fails, hence use generic version instead i.e py3
to handle it.

Even though [1] is fixed we are still seeing this failure.

FT ``test_agent_updated_at_use_nb_cfg_timestamp`` updates
""nb_cfg_timestamp"" in Chassis_Private table and then
checks if agent cache get's updated to the same value.

But ""ChassisAgentWriteEvent"" which is responsible for
updating AgentCache doesn't get triggered with updates on

On a recent change [1], some additional checks was added to avoid
ports overlapping cidrs on a router. On this change was also added
a check to do not attach more than one port IPv6 from same network,
but this check need to allow multiple ports when a deployment is
done using ml2/ovs+xvlan+dvr and the router has an external gateway
configured, because two ports are added:

- one with device_owner as network:router_interface_distributed

existing ports on the router for the same network_id.

Bulk port create without mac address fails as when Neutron calls
oslo_utils.netutils.get_ipv6_addr_by_EUI64, as the mac field of the port
is an ATTR_NOT_SPECIFIED Sentinel() object.

passed to the get_create_load_balancer_flow function call: use kwargs as the
flow creation function parameters and handle ""store"" separately.

When running in check mode, some prechecks previously failed because
they use the command module which is silently not run in check mode.
Other prechecks were not running correctly in check mode due to e.g.
looking for a string in empty command output or not querying which
containers are running.

This change fixes these issues.

Most other configuration entries are optional, see below. ======== These example device configuration snippets are assumed to be part to a specific file ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_genericswitch.ini``, but they could also be added directly to ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini``. Here is an example for the Cisco 300 series device::General configuration ===================== Physical networks need to be declared in the ML2 config as well, with a range of VLANs that can be allocated to tenant networks. Several physical networks can coexist, possibly with overlapping VLAN ranges: in that case, each switch configuration needs to include its physical network, see :ref:`physicalnetworks`. Example of ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini`` with two physical networks:: [ml2_type_vlan] network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:700:799,physnet2:600:850 For a given physical network, it is possible to specify several disjoint ranges of VLANs by simply repeating the physical network name multiple times:: [ml2_type_vlan] network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:700:720,physnet1:750:760 (Re)start ``neutron-server`` specifying the additional configuration file containing switch configuration::To stop networking generic switch trying to add or remove VLANs on the switch, administrator are expected to pre-add all enabled VLANs as well as tagging these VLANs on trunk ports. Once those VLANs and trunk ports are preconfigured on the switch, you can use the following configuration to stop networking generic switch adding or removing any VLANs:: Trunk ports =========== When VLANs are created on the switches, it is common to want to tag these VLANS on one or more trunk ports. To do this, you need to declare a comma-separated list of trunk ports that can be managed by Networking Generic Switch. It will then dynamically tag and untag VLANs on these ports whenever it creates and deletes VLANs. For example:: [genericswitch:device-hostname] ngs_trunk_ports = Ethernet1/48, Port-channel1 This is useful when managing several switches in the same physical network, because they are likely to be interconnected with trunk links. Another important use-case is to connect the DHCP agent with a trunk port, because the agent needs access to all active VLANs. Note that this option is only used if ``ngs_manage_vlans = True``. .. _physicalnetworks: Multiple physical networks ========================== It is possible to use Networking Generic Switch to manage several physical networks. The desired physical network is selected by the Neutron API client when it creates the network object. In this case, you may want to only create VLANs on switches that belong to the requested physical network, especially because VLAN ranges from separate physical networks may overlap. This also improves reconfiguration performance because fewer switches will need to be configured whenever a network is created/deleted. To this end, each switch can be configured with a list of physical networks it belongs to:: [genericswitch:device-hostname] ngs_physical_networks = physnet1, physnet2 Physical network names should match the names defined in the ML2 configuration. If no physical network is declared in a switch configuration, then VLANs for all physical networks will be created on this switch. Note that this option is only used if ``ngs_manage_vlans = True``. ","-------- Here is an example of ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_genericswitch.ini`` for the Cisco 300 series device:: ...

is affecting this conditional evaluation.

As this conditional way was used in several places, this
patch aims also to change those places to look alike.

For example, the server may have NVMe devices attached to a RAID controller which could be in pass-through or single disk volume mode. The same scenario exists basically regardless of the disk/storage medium/type. The basic reason why is that RAID controllers essentially act as command translators with a buffer cache. They tend to offer a simplified protocol to the Operating System, and interact with the storage device in whatever protocol is native to the device. This is the root of the underlying problem. Protocols such as SCSI are rooted in quite a bit of computing history, but never evolved to include primitives like Secure Erase which evolved in the `ATA protocol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA#HDD_passwords_and_security>`_. The closest primitives in SCSI to ATA Secure Erase is the ``FORMAT UNIT`` and ``UNMAP`` commands. ``FORMAT UNIT`` might be a viable solution, and a tool named `sg_format <https://linux.die.net/man/8/sg_format>`_ exists, but there has not been a sufficient call upstream to implement this and test it sufficiently that the Ironic community would be comfortable shipping such a capability. The possibility also exists that a RAID controller might not translate this command through to an end device, just as some RAID controllers know how to handle and pass through ATA commands to disk devices which support them. It is entirely dependent upon the hardware configuration scenario. The ``UNMAP`` command is similar to the ATA ``TRIM`` command. Unfortunately the SCSI protocol requires this be performed at block level, and similar to ``FORMAT UNIT``, it may not be supported or just passed through. If your interested in working on this area, or are willing to help test, please feel free to contact the `Ironic development community </ironic/latest/contributor/community>`_. One last item of note, depending on the RAID controller, the BMC, and a number of other variables, you may be able to leverage the `RAID <raid>`_ configuration interface to delete volumes/disks, and recreate them. This may have the same effect as a clean disk, however that too is RAID controller dependent behavior.",,47,0

This patch [1] introduced checking whether the CONF.dns.nameservers
is empty. If the CONF.dns.nameservers value is empty then the
initialization of the QueryClient fails. This change makes the majority
of designate-tempest-plugin tests fail even tests that do not use the
QueryClient.

This patch introduces three changes:

1) ValueError is raised only when the query() function is called so
   that only tests that actually use the query() function fail.

2) wait_for_query() function is fixed so that it never succeeds when the
   CONF.dns.nameservers value is empty.

3) Skip tests that rely upon [dns].nameserver value.

This adds ephemeral encryption capabilities to the libvirt driver and
defaults image backends to SUPPORTS_LUKS = False. Image backends that

Improve logic for making systemd mount dependent on
network-online.target when network filesystem is being used.

This change improves feature implemented in commit [1].

Currently when device is specified by UUID or LABEL, dependency for
network-online.target is added even it's not a network filesystem.
We should be careful with this as it may create circular dependency.
In my case, circular dependency looked like this:

network.target ->
  network-pre.target ->
    netfilter-persistent.service ->
      local-fs.target ->
        var-lib-nova.mount ->
          network-online.target ->
            network.target

Additionally, this commit was originally supposed to add dependency also
for CIFS mounts(these ones starting from '//') but it never worked in my
opinion. It was also fixed by this change.

In this release cycle, a few services are enabling the
enforce scope and new defaults by default. Example Nova:
- https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/nova/+/866218)

Until the new defaults enalbing by default is not released we
should keep testing the old defaults in existing jobs and we can
add new jobs testing new defautls. To do that we can provide the
way in devstack to keep scope/new defaults disable by default which
can be enabled by setting enforce_scope variable to true.

Once any service release the new defaults enabled by default then
we can switch the bhavior, enable the scope/new defaults by default
and a single job can disbale them to keep testing the old defaults
until service does not remove those.

When a user is prevented from listing a non-public
share, the API service would return a 403 Forbidden.
This isn't consistent with the API SIG's guidance
on resources restricted by virtue of RBAC policy since
users with malicious intent may use the signal to
mean that the resource exists.
