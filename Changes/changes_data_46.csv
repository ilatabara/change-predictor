Previously some of the container health check run log records were not collected
by rsyslog and so health status of some containers was not reported.

This patch makes it so all relevant log records from systemd-timer based health
check runs are collected and correctly parsed and so those containers with health
check attached will be reported.

Wallaby+ is using podman socket for fetching container status data, so this patch
is needed only for stable/train.

Fix issues with tox 4.2.4

tox now hard fails if there is mismatch in spec
attributes[1]. This works around the issue
temporarily. We probably have to drop py38 jobs
and specify basepython for py39 target in the
future.

Backport note:
This is now required to adapt to the new tox 4.0 release, which no
longer supports the old deprecated options.

New tox has a bunch of incompatibilities -- on master it's worth fixing
things so we can work in the new world, but on stable branches it seems
simplest to keep ourselves in the old world.

Do it at the project level to ensure the pin applies to the
periodic-stable jobs.

Also, skip installing python-dev on jammy.

Also, pin PasteDeploy to 2.1.1 on CentOS 7. This was the last version to
support py27.

stable/stein was first released in April 2019,
and the final release from this branch (8.1.4)
was made on 19 Nov 2020 [1]. This branch is
currently open only to take necessary third
party driver fixes and maintenance is at best
effort. A number of CI jobs have been broken
on this branch for a while. Let's clean them
up so we don't waste CI resources when backports
are proposed. This definitely implies loss
of test coverage, however, we have to weigh
the cost of repairing these CI jobs against
momentum of maintenance and work for the
future branches.

Jobs being dropped are:

* openstack-lower-constraints
pip's latest dependency resolver unearthed a bunch
of broken dependencies on this branch. Resolving these
would involve bumping the ""lower"" requirements, the
team does not think this will be useful for anyone,
since we will not be altering requirements for this
branch anymore.
* manila-tempest-dsvm-mysql-generic and
The reference generic driver had four jobs on this
branch, manila-tempest-dsvm-generic-no-share-servers.
We can cut it down to two by dropping coverage
for the DHSS=False configuration and multibackend,
both of which are tested in the other jobs, albeit
with other backends.
* manila-tempest-minimal-dsvm-lvm-centos-7
This is a lost cause, we don't expect to fix
devstack on centos-7 anytime soon for these
old extended maintenance branches (See bug#1888717)
* manila-rally-multibackend and
manila-rally-multibackend-no-ss - these rally
jobs have been broken for a while, there's
barely any reason to think we'll cause performance
regressions in the API on this branch and use
these jobs to judge them.

Also drop all the experimental jobs and remove
""openstack-tox-cover"" from the post queue.
We can also remove the openstack-tox-genconfig
job from the gate queue, since it exists on
the check queue, and need only run once.

Pin the version of tempest to a version
that supports python2.7, since we do not
fully support functional testing with
python3 on this branch.

The share ""manage"" API checks whether
an existing/known share is being imported by
matching the export path provided to existing
shares.

This lookup does not consider the
fact that shares may have multiple export
locations, because it relies on an old/deprecated
""export_location"" property on shares which
was added to provide backwards compatibility
to the API that presented only one export
location per share.

Further, it's possible to get a
""ERROR: Invalid share: Share already exists""
exception even when no such share exists in the
database.

Fix the lookup by using the ""export_location_path""
based lookup which is faster, since it performs
a meaningful join on the export locations table;
and remove the parameters ""protocol""
and ""share_type_id"" - these things make no
difference when there's a duplicated export
location. We'll consider ""host"" as a lookup
parameter since we can't be sure that export
locations are unique in a deployment - but they
ought to be unique for a given host.

The existing ""manila-grenade"" job relies on
devstack-gate, a deprecated project. The Grenade
project now has a native zuulv3 style job that
we can inherit and run manila's upgrade tests.

Manila's grenade tests are only going to run
API tests, and hence this grenade job doesn't
have to enable nova, cinder, glance, neutron

us from disabling nova at the moment,
and nova requires glance, placement and neutron
to be deployed, so we'll be enabling these

New tox has a bunch of incompatibilities -- on master it's worth fixing
things so we can work in the new world, but on stable branches it seems
simplest to keep ourselves in the old world.

Do it at the project level to ensure the pin applies to the
periodic-stable jobs.

Also, skip installing python-dev on jammy.

Also, pin PasteDeploy to 2.1.1 on CentOS 7. This was the last version to
support py27.

New tox has a bunch of incompatibilities -- on master it's worth fixing
things so we can work in the new world, but on stable branches it seems
simplest to keep ourselves in the old world.

Do it at the project level to ensure the pin applies to the
periodic-stable jobs.

Also simplify our warning suppressions. The message filter is a regex,
so any prefix of the message will suffice. This allows us to also drop a
new message seen on CentOS 8:

   CryptographyDeprecationWarning: Python 3.6 is no longer
   supported by the Python core team. Therefore, support for
   it is deprecated in cryptography. The next release of
   cryptography (40.0) will be the last to support Python 3.6.

As we've previously seen with cryptography warnings, this can slow down
our probe tests to the point that they time out.

Also, skip installing python-dev on jammy.

Since systemd-252, calling lvextend on /home or /srv will sometimes
(~20%) cause the volume to be unmounted, here is the logging sequence:

growvols[2428]:   Logical volume vg/lv_srv successfully resized.

The event ""Stopped target Local File Systems."" should only happen
when dmeventd notifies that the thin pool is near capacity as a safety
measure, which is clearly not the case:

$ lvs

  lv_var      vg Vwi-aotz-- <37.43g lv_thinpool        1.10

I speculate that the root cause is that systemd-252 is intrepreting
messages from dmeventd differently since systemd-250 and either the
message or the intrepretation is incorrect.

This change sets LVM_RUN_BY_DMEVENTD=1 for each lvextend run, which
according to the dmeventd man page:

  Variable is set by thin and vdo plugin to prohibit recursive
  interation with dmeventd by any executed lvm2 command from a
  thin_command, vdo_command environment.

This means lvextend will not trigger dmeventd, avoiding the incorrect
unmount. Growvols is run in early boot before any workload is running,
and growth values are assumed to not go beyond pool capacity, so it
could be appropriate to leave this workaround in place indefinitely.

New tox has a bunch of incompatibilities -- on master it's worth fixing
things so we can work in the new world, but on stable branches it seems
simplest to keep ourselves in the old world.

Do it at the project level to ensure the pin applies to the
periodic-stable jobs.

Also simplify our warning suppressions. The message filter is a regex,
so any prefix of the message will suffice. This allows us to also drop a
new message seen on CentOS 8:

   CryptographyDeprecationWarning: Python 3.6 is no longer
   supported by the Python core team. Therefore, support for
   it is deprecated in cryptography. The next release of
   cryptography (40.0) will be the last to support Python 3.6.

As we've previously seen with cryptography warnings, this can slow down
our probe tests to the point that they time out.

The main goal of this PS is to make sure the migrator can complete the migrations even if mariadb galera cluster dropped the migrator connection leaving the database in inconsistent state. It may happen that migration_log has a record of a successfully performed migration while the database scheme misses an entity so any further attempts to re-run the migrator fail because of missed entity the migrator expects to be present.

Also the migrator is running mariadb image as a main one and grafana binaries are mounted as /usr/share/grafana. Migrator job container is running under nobody user uid.

This PS runs migrator in a safe way:
- prepares database backup
- runs a single instance of grafana as migrator with log file as a background process in a loop
- constantly checks the log file in the main process
- in case of the migrations completed it stops grafana-server process and completed the job
- in case of a migration error it restores the previously prepared backup so the grafana-server that is running in a background loop can re-try the migration
- the database operations are prefixed with code that makes sure the database is reachable.

New tox has a bunch of incompatibilities -- on master it's worth fixing
things so we can work in the new world, but on stable branches it seems
simplest to keep ourselves in the old world.

This patch adds support for cold migrate, and resize with PCI
devices when the placement tracking is enabled.

Same host resize, evacuate and unshelve will be supported by subsequent
patches. Live migration was not supported with flavor based PCI requests
before so it won't be supported now either.

The 'all-plugin' tox environment was deprecated by this patch [1].
Instead of the 'all-plugin' it is recommended to use the 'all' tox
environment.

This patch removes any reference to 'all-plugin' tox environment and
updates the documentation so that the installation steps work with
the 'all' tox venv.

Wallaby branch is in Extended Maintenance now[1]. Tempest and
tempest plugins are branchless which means master version of
Tempest and its plugins is used to test the supported stable
branches.

Once any stable branch is moved to EM state then, Tempest and
its plugins compatible tag[2] needs to be released so that we can
keep testing the EM stable branches with that tag once master
Tempest and its plugins are not compatible[3].

Initially, _check_incomplete_consumers was intended to find the case
when consumers are mentioned in allocation but do not exist in the
consumer table. Due to a bug it's possible to have rows in the
consumer table those are not in the allocation table. The second case
it seems was not expected and it can be tricky to automate a cleanup

This patch modifies the check such way it counts only consumers
presented in the allocation table.

In fullstack security group test, after fake VMs are created there
check if connectivity to some custom port is working fine with port

After that there is called ""block_until_ping"" method for each vms.

This patch changes that to first wait if we can ping vms and later do

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Ironic Shards ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/ironic-shards Problem description =================== Nova's Ironic driver involves a single nova-compute service managing many compute nodes, where each compute node record maps to an Ironic node. Some deployments support 1000s of ironic nodes, but a single nova-compute service is unable to manage 1000s of nodes and 1000s of instances. Currently we support setting a partition key, where nova-compute only cares about a subset of ironic nodes, those associated with a specific conductor group. Howerver, some conductor groups can be very large, servered by many ironic-conductor services. To help with this, Nova has attempted to dynamically spread ironic nodes between a set of nova-compute peers. While this work some of the time, there are some major limitations: * when one nova-compute is down, only unassigned ironic nodes can move to another nova-compute service * i.e. when one nova-compute is down, all ironic nodes with nova instances associated with the down nova-compute service are unable to be managed, i.e. reboot will fail * moreover, when the old nova-compute comes back up, which might take some time, there are lots of bugs as the hash ring slowly rebalances This spec about tweaking the way we shard Ironic compute nodes. We need to stop violating deep assumptions in the compute manager code by moving to a more static ironic node partitions. Use Cases --------- Any users of the ironic driver that have more than one nova-compute service per conductor group should move to an active-passive failover mode. The new static sharding will be of paritcular interest for clouds with ironic conductor groups that are greater than around 1000 baremetal nodes. Note that many parts of this story work today but need better documentation: * active-passive failover for nova-compute services running the ironic driver * sharding ironic-conductors and nova-computes using ironic conductor groups, at the same time as using active-passive failover * understanding the current scale limit of around 500-1000 ironic nodes per nova-compute, and the best way to scale beyond that Proposed change =============== Firstly, we must deprecate the user of the peer_list with more than one host. We need the logic that tries to move Compute Nodes to never work unless the peer_list is larger than one. We expect to keep the option of sharding by conductor group, but rename the key so its more obviously about the conductor group. We need to add the option to limit the ironic nodes being managed by nova-compute to make use of the new sharding key in ironic. This can't be used the same time as the conductor group key above. TODO: reference the ironic spec. Add a nova-manage command to help move instances between hosts to help migrate from multiple nova-computes to a single nova-compute with active-passive fallback. This will also help when moving ironic nodes between shards. Only instances on compute nodes that are forced down in the API can be moved with this tool (just like with evactuate). Alternatives ------------ We could attempt to keep fixing the hash ring recovery within the ironic driver, but its very unclear what will break next due to all the deep assumptions made about the nova-compute process. Data model impact ----------------- TBC. We need to make sure we don't have any surpizes when nodes move between shards, or active-passive fail over happens. It is quite related to this spec: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/nova-specs/+/853837 Maybe we need to record the shard in the DB, so we don't get shocked when it changes. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ It should help users more easily support large ironic deployments integrated with Nova.

Add new charm configuration option to configure the HA queue policy
ha-promote-on-shutdown defaulting to 'always' (previously it would use
the rabbitmq internal default of 'when-synced').

This is mainly a workaround for RabbitMQ v3.6 bugs where the queues are
likely to get stuck during rolling restarts of the cluster requiring a
simultaneous cluster stop before then starting them again to recover.
Typical symptoms are timeouts reported in the log when trying to declare
or consume the queue. See Bug #1943929 for details.

However it is also generally recommended in various places as the
openstack message queue largely works better favouring availability over
consistency as messages would typically timeout after only a few minutes
at most anyway before any recovery is likely to happen.

It appears we are getting an opcode error when attempting to boot
Centos 9-stream utilizing the EFI artifacts from Ubuntu.

Technically this should work, however further aftifacts in the boot
chain may be signed with other key credentials that Ubuntu's
grub does not know about, because the chain of trust is
MSFT -> Vendor shim (slow change rate) -> Vendor GRUB -> Kernel

Where vendor differences should never work, is if Secure Boot
is enforcing.

A similar Debian bug is open for a very similar issue:

However, no additional comments or information have been in follow
up to that reported issue. So in the mean time, we're going to try
and do what those smarter than I recommend, use the vendor's
binaries for their distribution.

Keycloak only enables the introspection API when using a 'confidential'
client.  This means that for user initiated OAuth2 tokens the user would
need to know the secrets for a client (ie the confidential piece).

With Keycloak to use a 'public' client, where the user doesn't need to
know a client secret, you need to use a JWKS to validate the JWT tokens
instead of the introspection endpoint.

By setting KeystoneOpenIdcVerifyMethod to 'jwks' and
KeystoneOpenIdcVerifyJwksUri to the published URI for the JSON Web Key Set
you can switch over to 'local' verification of the token using signed data
in the JWT.

Primarily remove the workaround added in
Ia6d512ff2ae417bab938cb095fbb0884d195010a which added
continued use of autocommit, which is incompatible with
SQLAlchemy 2.0.

Also set the environment for unit tests to report compatability
warnings, although it appears none are being reported at this time.

Also cuts out the db upgrade cruft to only use the online database
migration code through oslo_db's enginefacade, which has the smarts
to handle online or offline migrations.

And then, retools unit/functional test data storage to utlize sqlite,
and in that re-tooled the queries to prevent locking conditions

Also, don't mock and test time.sleep().

Additionally, it looks like we have discovered the root cause of the

Example: lsblk: /dev/nvme0n1p2: not a block device What has happened is the partition contains an partition table inside of it which is conflusing the NVMe device interaction. While basically valid in some cases to have have nested partition tables, for example, with software raid, in the NVMe case the driver and possibly the underlying device gets quite confused. This is in part because partitions in NVMe devices are higher level abstracts. The way this occurs is you likely had a ``whole-disk`` image, and it was configured as a partition image. If using glance, your image properties may have a ``img_type`` field, which should be ``whole-disk``, or you have a ``kernel_id`` and ``ramdisk_id`` value in the glance image ``properties`` field. Definition of a kernel and ramdisk value also indicates that the image is of a ``partition`` image type. This is because a ``whole-disk`` image is bootable from the contents within the image, and partition images are unable to be booted without a kernel, and ramdisk. If your using ironic in standalone mode, the optional ``instance_info/image_type`` setting may be advisable to be checked. Very similar to Glance usage above, if you have set Ironic's node level ``instance_info/kernel`` and ``instance_info/ramdisk`` parameters, Ironic will proceed with deploying an image as if it is a partition image, and create a partition table on the new block device, and then write the contents of the image into the newly created partition. .. NOTE:: As a general reminder, the Ironic community recommends the use of whole disk images over the use of partition images.",,38,0

In fullstack security group test, after fake VMs are created there
check if connectivity to some custom port is working fine with port
security disabled.
After that there is called ""block_until_ping"" method for each vms.

This patch changes that to first wait if we can ping vms and later do
netcat tests.
Even if that will not solve problems with failures of this test, we
may know more if the issue is caused by netcat or it's just no
ICMP connectivity between VMs at all.

statistics and pollutes the final report.

Wallaby branch is in Extended Maintenance now[1]. Tempest and
tempest plugins are branchless which means master version of
Tempest and its plugins is used to test the supported stable
branches.

Once any stable branch is moved to EM state then, Tempest and
its plugins compatible tag[2] needs to be released so that we can

When a new HM is created, the provisioning status is conditioned
by the status of the existing members on the pool. When any of
the members are in ERROR status (e.g. when a member is configure
with non existing address) the created HM is in ERROR status.

It makes more sense to warn about the member problem but let the
HM continue with its normal flow of operation over the possible
remaining members that exist for the pool on which it is created.
This patch removes the break after finding a problematic member
(port not found) and just log a warning about the issue, but
continue with the rest of the members.

Default policy in neutron doesn't allow port security to change
if network not owned by the user. To allow users to update other
attributes of a port don't send port_security_enabled attribute
to neutron unless it changes.

If user tries to change port security on a port in a network not
owned by them it will still error as it does now.

If no NetworkConfigTemplate parameter is set when exporting
overcloud nodes to baremetal_deployment.yaml an attempt to
look for a legacy Heat nic-config template is made.

In case a heat nic-config template is found it will be
downloaded from the stack to a temporary file. The tool

used to convert the template to an ansible j2 nic-config

The template created by the conversion tool is placed in

While collecting information because of a question I received
about soft delete and shadow tables I realized that the documentation
contains bits and pieces here and there, but I couldn't find more.
This change summarizes what I found from docs and asking around.
I hope you find it useful.

During the delay, the instance is marked to be in state ``SOFT_DELETED`` and can be restored (``openstack server restore``) by an admin in order to gracefully handle human mistakes. If the instance is not restored during the configured delay, a periodic job actually deletes the instance. This feature is optional and by default off. See also: - ""Delete, Restore"" in `API Guide: Server Concepts <https://docs.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/server_concepts.html#server-actions>`_ - ``reclaim_instance_interval`` in the `config reference <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/configuration/config.html#DEFAULT.reclaim_instance_interval>`_ Soft delete to shadow tables ---------------------------- At an actual instance delete, no DB record is deleted. Instead the records are marked as deleted (for example ``instances.deleted`` in Nova cell databases). This preserves historic information for debugging and audit uses. But it also leads to accumulation of data in Nova cell DB tables, which may have an effect on Nova DB performance as documented in `DB prune deleted rows <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/upgrades.html#concepts>`_. The records marked as deleted can be cleaned up in multiple stages. First you can move them to so-called shadow tables (tables with prefix ``shadow_`` in Nova cell databases). This is called *archiving the deleted rows*. Nova does not query shadow tables, therefore data moved to the shadow tables no longer affect DB performance. However storage space is still consumed. Then you can actually delete the information from the shadow tables. This is called *DB purge*. These operations can be performed by nova-manage: - https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/cli/nova-manage.html#db-archive-deleted-rows - https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/cli/nova-manage.html#db-purge This feature is not optional. Every long-running deployment should regularly archive and purge the deleted rows. For example via a cron job to regularly call ``nova-manage db archive_deleted_rows`` and ``nova-manage db purge``. The tradeoffs between data retention, DB performance and storage needs should be considered. In the Mitaka release there was an agreement between Nova developers that it's not desirable to provide shadow tables for every table in the Nova database, `documented in a spec <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/mitaka/implemented/no-more-soft-delete.html>`_. Therefore not all information about an instance is preserved in the shadow tables. Since then new shadow tables are not introduced. ",,63,0

Currently, if the iSCSI CIDR filter filters out some portals in
a synchronous replication setup, it only filters out the portals
but leaves the IQNs and LUNs, which can result in a mismatched
set of connection lists. This addresses the issue by filtering
earlier in the process, and only adding ones that pass the filter
in the first place.

root user/group ownership of the neutron-ovn-metadata service caused
the neutron lock dir to be owned by root:root, which caused issues
with neutron-server's ability to write the OVN hash ring lock file
to /run/lock/neutron and prevented the creation of networks.

It appears neutron-ovn-metadata-agent needs access to the OVS DB
schema via unix:/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock, which is owned by root,
so a separate lock path has been created for the metadata agent to
workaround this.

FWIW, this issue manifested with upstream Neutron commit
536498a29a4e7662a4d0b1bb923e2521509ad77a.

At present, the collection and compression of static file is
carried out asynchronously to speed up execution. If compression
starts before collection has completed it can result in incomplete
results which cause the Horizon front end to produce 500 errors.

This patch switches the collection of static files back to a
synchronous task before triggering the slower compression as an
asynchronous task to maintain most of the speed-up benefit.

Patch [1] introduced new mechanism which only brings UP interfaces
on master node of HA router. It works fine with keepalived 1.x
but it is broken when keepalived 2.x was used (e.g. on Centos 8) as
in this new version of keepalived by default all interfaces of VIPs
and routes are tracked, and if one of them is DOWN, keepalived is
going to FAULT state. Because of that router will never be
transitioned to MASTER on any node.

This patch fixes it by adding ""no_track"" option to all VIPs
and routes in keepalived's config file.

This ""no_track"" option isn't added to ha interface so this one
is still tracked by keepalived.

For deployment/evaluation we have another guide. Allways use the latest stable version from the distribution of your choice. Recommended reading ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ It's beneficial to learn basics of both `Ansible <https://docs.ansible.com>`__ and `Docker <https://docs.docker.com>`__ before running Kolla Ansible. Host machine requirements ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The host machine must satisfy the following minimum requirements: - 2 network interfaces - 8GB main memory - 40GB disk space - If you want to use cinder you need to configure a LVM or NFS. `Cinder-guide <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/reference/storage/cinder-guide.html>_. See the :kolla-ansible-doc:`support matrix <user/support-matrix>` for details of supported host Operating Systems. Kolla Ansible supports the default Python 3.x versions provided by the supported Operating Systems. For more information see `tested runtimes <|TESTED_RUNTIMES_GOVERNANCE_URL|>`_. Install dependencies ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Typically commands that use the system package manager in this section must be run with root privileges. It is generally recommended to use a virtual environment to install Kolla Ansible and its dependencies, to avoid conflicts with the system site packages. Note that this is independent from the use of a virtual environment for remote execution, which is described in :kolla-ansible-doc:`Virtual Environments <user/virtual-environments.html>`. #. For Debian or Ubuntu, update the package index. .. code-block:: console sudo apt update #. Install Python build dependencies: For CentOS, RHEL 8 or openEuler, run: .. code-block:: console sudo dnf install python3-devel libffi-devel gcc openssl-devel python3-libselinux For Debian or Ubuntu, run: .. code-block:: console sudo apt install python3-dev libffi-dev gcc libssl-dev Install dependencies using a virtual environment ------------------------------------------------ If not installing Kolla Ansible in a virtual environment, skip this section. #. Install the virtual environment dependencies. For CentOS, RHEL 8 or openEuler, you don't need to do anything. For Debian or Ubuntu, run: .. code-block:: console sudo apt install python3-venv #. Create a virtual environment and activate it: .. code-block:: console python3 -m venv /path/to/venv source /path/to/venv/bin/activate The virtual environment should be activated before running any commands that depend on packages installed in it. #. Ensure the latest version of pip is installed: .. code-block:: console pip install -U pip #. Install `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com>`__. Kolla Ansible requires at least Ansible ``4`` and supports up to ``5``. .. code-block:: console pip install 'ansible>=4,<6' #. Create a ansible.cfg file with default settings (all commented out) if not allready done before. .. code-block:: console ansible-config init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg This will create the ansible.cfg file in the current directory. If you want to use another path like /etc/ansible or something else, use the directly path. Install dependencies not using a virtual environment ---------------------------------------------------- If installing Kolla Ansible in a virtual environment, skip this section. #. Install ``pip``. For CentOS, RHEL or openEuler, run: .. code-block:: console sudo dnf install python3-pip For Debian or Ubuntu, run: .. code-block:: console sudo apt install python3-pip #. Ensure the latest version of pip is installed: .. code-block:: console sudo pip3 install -U pip #. Install `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com>`__. Kolla Ansible requires at least Ansible ``4`` and supports up to ``5``. For CentOS or RHEL, run: .. code-block:: console sudo dnf install ansible For openEuler, run: .. code-block:: console sudo pip install ansible For Debian or Ubuntu, run: .. code-block:: console sudo apt install ansible .. note:: If the installed Ansible version does not meet the requirements, one can use pip: ``sudo pip install -U 'ansible>=4,<6'``. Beware system package upgrades might interfere with that so it is recommended to uninstall the system package first. One might be better off with the virtual environment method to avoid this pitfall. Install Kolla-ansible ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #. Clone ``kolla-ansible`` repository from git. .. code-block:: console git clone --branch |KOLLA_BRANCH_NAME| https://opendev.org/openstack/kolla-ansible #. Install requirements of ``kolla`` and ``kolla-ansible``: If using a virtual environment: .. code-block:: console pip install ./kolla-ansible If not using a virtual environment: .. code-block:: console sudo pip3 install ./kolla-ansible #. Create the ``/etc/kolla`` directory. .. code-block:: console sudo mkdir -p /etc/kolla sudo chown $USER:$USER /etc/kolla #. Copy the configuration files to ``/etc/kolla`` directory. ``kolla-ansible`` holds the configuration files ( ``globals.yml`` and ``passwords.yml``) in ``etc/kolla``. .. code-block:: console cp -r kolla-ansible/etc/kolla/* /etc/kolla #. Copy the inventory files to the current directory. ``kolla-ansible`` holds inventory files ( ``all-in-one`` and ``multinode``) in the ``ansible/inventory`` directory. .. code-block:: console cp kolla-ansible/ansible/inventory/* . Install Ansible Galaxy requirements ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Install Ansible Galaxy dependencies (Yoga release onwards): .. code-block:: console kolla-ansible install-deps Configure Ansible ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ For best results, Ansible configuration should be tuned for your environment. For example, add the following options to the Ansible configuration file ``/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`` or ``/path/to/venv/ansible.cfg``: .. code-block:: ini [defaults] host_key_checking=False pipelining=True forks=100 Further information on tuning Ansible is available `here <https://www.ansible.com/blog/ansible-performance-tuning>`__. Prepare initial configuration ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Inventory --------- The next step is to prepare our inventory file. An inventory is an Ansible file where we specify hosts and the groups that they belong to. We can use this to define node roles and access credentials. Kolla Ansible comes with ``all-in-one`` and ``multinode`` example inventory files. The difference between them is that the former is ready for deploying single node OpenStack on localhost. In this Guide we will show the ``all-in-one`` Installation. For ``all-in-one`` scenario in virtual environment add the following to the very beginning of the inventory: .. code-block:: console localhost ansible_python_interpreter=python3 Kolla passwords --------------- Passwords used in our deployment are stored in ``/etc/kolla/passwords.yml`` file. All passwords are blank in this file and have to be filled either manually or by running random password generator: .. code-block:: console cd kolla-ansible/tools ./generate_passwords.py Kolla globals.yml ----------------- ``globals.yml`` is the main configuration file for Kolla Ansible and per default stored in /etc/kolla/globals.yml. There are a few options that are required to deploy Kolla Ansible: * Image options User has to specify images that are going to be used for our deployment. In this guide `Quay.io <https://quay.io/organization/openstack.kolla>`__-provided, pre-built images are going to be used. To learn more about building mechanism, please refer :kolla-doc:`Building Container Images <admin/image-building.html>`. Kolla provides choice of several Linux distributions in containers: - CentOS Stream (``centos``) - Ubuntu (``ubuntu``) - Debian (``debian``) - RHEL (``rhel``, deprecated) For newcomers, we recommend to use CentOS Stream 8 or Ubuntu 20.04. .. code-block:: console kolla_base_distro: ""centos"" * Networking Kolla Ansible requires a few networking options to be set. We need to set network interfaces used by OpenStack. First interface to set is ""network_interface"". This is the default interface for multiple management-type networks. .. code-block:: console network_interface: ""eth0"" Second interface required is dedicated for Neutron external (or public) networks, can be vlan or flat, depends on how the networks are created. This interface should be active without IP address. If not, instances won't be able to access to the external networks. .. code-block:: console neutron_external_interface: ""eth1"" To learn more about network configuration, refer :kolla-ansible-doc:`Network overview <admin/production-architecture-guide.html#network-configuration>`. Next we need to provide floating IP for management traffic. This IP will be managed by keepalived to provide high availability, and should be set to be *not used* address in management network that is connected to our ``network_interface``. If you use an existing OpenStack installation for your deployment, make sure the IP is allowed in the configuration of your VM. .. code-block:: console kolla_internal_vip_address: ""10.1.0.250"" * Enable additional services By default Kolla Ansible provides a bare compute kit, however it does provide support for a vast selection of additional services. To enable them, set ``enable_*`` to ""yes"". For example, to enable Block Storage service: .. code-block:: console enable_cinder: ""yes"" If you wanna use Cinder in your testdeployment you must configure a Cinder backend: .. code-block:: console enable_cinder_backend_lvm: ""yes"" For more information about this, please read the `Cinder-guide <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/reference/storage/cinder-guide.html>`_. Kolla now supports many OpenStack services, there is `a list of available services <https://github.com/openstack/kolla-ansible/blob/master/README.rst#openstack-services>`_. For more information about service configuration, Please refer to the :kolla-ansible-doc:`Services Reference Guide <reference/index.html>`. * Multiple globals files For a more granular control, enabling any option from the main ``globals.yml`` file can now be done using multiple yml files. Simply, create a directory called ``globals.d`` under ``/etc/kolla/`` and place all the relevant ``*.yml`` files in there. The ``kolla-ansible`` script will, automatically, add all of them as arguments to the ``ansible-playbook`` command. An example use case for this would be if an operator wants to enable cinder and all its options, at a later stage than the initial deployment, without tampering with the existing ``globals.yml`` file. That can be achieved, using a separate ``cinder.yml`` file, placed under the ``/etc/kolla/globals.d/`` directory and adding all the relevant options in there. * Virtual environment It is recommended to use a virtual environment to execute tasks on the remote hosts. This is covered :kolla-ansible-doc:`Virtual Environments <user/virtual-environments.html>`. Deployment ~~~~~~~~~~ After configuration is set, we can proceed to the deployment phase. First we need to setup basic host-level dependencies, like docker. Kolla Ansible provides a playbook that will install all required services in the correct versions. The following assumes the use of the ``all-in-one`` inventory. If using a different inventory, such as ``multinode``, replace the ``-i`` argument accordingly. #. Bootstrap servers with kolla deploy dependencies: .. code-block:: console cd kolla-ansible/tools ./kolla-ansible -i ../../all-in-one bootstrap-servers #. Do pre-deployment checks for hosts: .. code-block:: console kolla-ansible -i ../../all-in-one prechecks #. Finally proceed to actual OpenStack deployment: .. code-block:: console kolla-ansible -i ../../all-in-one deploy When this playbook finishes, OpenStack should be up, running and functional! If error occurs during execution, refer to :kolla-ansible-doc:`troubleshooting guide <user/troubleshooting.html>`. Using OpenStack ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #. Install the OpenStack CLI client: .. code-block:: console pip install python-openstackclient -c https://releases.openstack.org/constraints/upper/|KOLLA_OPENSTACK_RELEASE| #. OpenStack requires a ``clouds.yaml`` file where credentials for the admin user are set. To generate this file: .. code-block:: console cd kolla-ansible/tools ./kolla-ansible post-deploy * The file will be generated in /etc/kolla/clouds.yaml, you can use it by copying it to /etc/openstack or ~/.config/openstack or setting OS_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. #. Depending on how you installed Kolla Ansible, there is a script that will create example networks, images, and so on. .. warning:: You are free to use the following ``init-runonce`` script for demo purposes but note it does **not** have to be run in order to use your cloud. Depending on your customisations, it may not work, or it may conflict with the resources you want to create. You have been warned. .. code-block:: console kolla-ansible/tools/init-runonce ",,459,0

For tox 3.x and earlier, passenv was a space-separated list; as of tox
4.0.0, it's comma-separated. For a while, our spaces would be silently
included in the now-one-and-only passenv value parsed (which wasn't
great, but mostly just caused confusion) -- as of tox 4.0.6, however, it
became a hard error, and all tests would fail like

  pass_env values cannot contain whitespace, use comma to have multiple
  values in a single line, invalid values found 'SWIFT_* *_proxy'

Unfortunately, we don't really know what versions of tox all our various
stakeholders might want/need to use (though we previously set a
minversion of 2.3.2). We might be able to spread values over multiple
lines to make it compatible with both tox 3 *and* tox 4, but I'm fairly
certain *_proxy was only included for some variables that are recent
versions of tox include by default anyway, so just increase our
minversion (which was too low, anyway -- allowlist_externals which we
already configure was added in 3.18.0) and get rid of *_proxy.

FWIW, python-swiftclient was already specifying 3.18.0 as a minversion,
so I expect the new minversion to not be a problem.

Also, add ./.functests to a bunch of allowlist_externals, as newer tox
is more strict about that sort of thing.

Drop skipsdist in a bunch of places so we can import swift from func
tests and docs. (Still not sure why I don't see us hitting a similar
problem for unit tests...)
