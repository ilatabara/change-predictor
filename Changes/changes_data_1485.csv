Handle liberty-era neutron

We had a workaround for this in the shade code, but it really should
have been in the CloudRegion code.

The underlying issue here is that neutron didn't have a version
discovery document, and also that neutronclient just hard-coded an
append of v2.0 to the end of the endpoint in the catalog. There's really
no way around also doing an append - but we can do our best to not do
the append unless we need to.

Work around discovery being a bit messy for cinder

Discovery for block-storage is tricky due to project_ids being needed in
the URL still, but the unversioned endpoint in the catalog having no
project_id. Nobody is actually using block-storage yet, so hack it for
the moment until we can figure out a proper solution.

All common implementation for vmware has been split out to
the oslo.vmware library, which is currently an optional dependency.
We have to make sure this library is installed so that vmware driver
is functional.

Also, python(3)-suds is required by python(3)-oslo-vmware so we don't
have to explicitly installs this library.

Additionally this fixes the wrong indent in the spec file.

The Cinder NVMeoF deployment YAML has a couple of issues addressed in
this patch:

- Incorrect port is being used. According to the NVM Express specs: ""TCP
  port 4420 has been assigned for use by NVMe over Fabrics"". And that's
  the port default in Cinder as well.

- Instead of loading ``nvme-rdma`` we should load ``nvme-fabrics`` so it
  will automatically load the right module when connecting (``nvme-tcp``
  or ``nvme-rdma``).

- There is no need to load ``nvme`` module, since that's only used for
  local nvme volumes, and we care about remote modules.

- Controller nodes also connect to storage (for example for backups), so
  we need to load ``nvme-fabrics`` there as well.

- An iptables rule to allow port 4420 is needed, just like the one we
  have for iscsi (port 3260).

- Add a new CinderEnableNVMeOFBackend parameter, which triggers
  the configuration of the LVM volumes, mirroring the behavior
  of CinderEnableIscsiBackend.

Refer to CVE-2022-47950 for more information. * Fixed a path-rewriting bug introduced in Python 3.7.14, 3.8.14, 3.9.14, and 3.10.6 that could cause some `domain_remap` requests to be routed to the wrong object. swift (2.29.2, yoga stable backports) * Fixed a security issue in how `s3api` handles XML parsing that allowed authenticated S3 clients to read arbitrary files from proxy servers. Refer to CVE-2022-47950 for more information. * Constant-time string comparisons are now used when checking S3 API signatures. * Fixed a path-rewriting bug introduced in Python 3.7.14, 3.8.14, 3.9.14, and 3.10.6 that could cause some `domain_remap` requests to be routed to the wrong object. * Improved compatibility with certain FIPS-mode-enabled systems. swift (2.28.1, xena stable backports) * Fixed a security issue in how `s3api` handles XML parsing that allowed authenticated S3 clients to read arbitrary files from proxy servers. Refer to CVE-2022-47950 for more information. * Constant-time string comparisons are now used when checking S3 API signatures. * Fixed a path-rewriting bug introduced in Python 3.7.14, 3.8.14, 3.9.14, and 3.10.6 that could cause some `domain_remap` requests to be routed to the wrong object. * Improved compatibility with certain FIPS-mode-enabled systems. * Ensure that non-durable data and .meta files are purged from handoffs after syncing. swift (2.25.1, ussuri stable backports) * Python 3 bug fixes: * Fixed an error when reading encrypted data that was written while running Python 2 for a path that includes non-ASCII characters. This was caused by a difference in string types that resulted in ambiguity when decrypting. To prevent the ambiguity for new data, set `meta_version_to_write = 3` in your keymaster configuration after upgrading all proxy servers. If upgrading from Swift 2.20.0 or Swift 2.19.1 or earlier, set `meta_version_to_write = 1` in your keymaster configuration prior to upgrading. * Object expiration respects the `expiring_objects_container_divisor` config option. * `fallocate_reserve` may be specified as a percentage in more places. * The ETag-quoting middleware no longer raises TypeErrors. * Improved how containers reclaim deleted rows to reduce locking and object update throughput. * Fix a proxy-server error when retrieving erasure coded data when there are durable fragments but not enough to reconstruct. * Fixed some SignatureDoesNotMatch errors when using the AWS .NET SDK. * Region name config option is now respected when configuring S3 credential caching. swift (2.23.3, train stable backports) * Sharding improvements: * Prevent object updates from auto-creating shard containers. This ensures more consistent listings for sharded containers during rebalances. * Deleted shard containers are no longer considered root containers. This prevents unnecessary sharding audit failures and allows the deleted shard database to actually be unlinked. * The sharder daemon has been enhanced to better support the shrinking of shards that are no longer required. Shard containers will now discover from their root container if they should be shrinking. They will also discover the shards into which they should shrink, which may include the root container itself. * Improved performance of sharded container listings when performing prefix listings. * Improved container-sharder stat reporting to reduce load on root container databases. * The container sharder can now handle containers with special characters in their names. * `swift-container-info` now summarizes shard range information. Pass `-v`/`--verbose` if you want to see all of them. * Don't inject shard ranges when user quits. * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements. * Python 3 bug fixes: * Fixed a potential server error when uploading data via a tempurl. * Fixed a potential server error when getting symlink details. * Added the ability to connect to memcached over TLS. See the `tls_*` options in etc/memcache.conf-sample swift (2.23.2, train stable backports) * Python 3 bug fixes: * Fixed an error when reading encrypted data that was written while running Python 2 for a path that includes non-ASCII characters. This was caused by a difference in string types that resulted in ambiguity when decrypting. To prevent the ambiguity for new data, set `meta_version_to_write = 3` in your keymaster configuration after upgrading all proxy servers. If upgrading from Swift 2.20.0 or Swift 2.19.1 or earlier, set `meta_version_to_write = 1` in your keymaster configuration prior to upgrading. * Fixed an issue when reading or writing objects with a content-type like `message/*`. Previously, Swift would fail to respond. * Object expiration respects the `expiring_objects_container_divisor` config option. * `fallocate_reserve` may be specified as a percentage in more places. * The formpost middleware now works with unicode file names. * Certain S3 API headers are now lower case as they would be coming from AWS. * Improved how containers reclaim deleted rows to reduce locking and object update throughput. * Fix a proxy-server error when retrieving erasure coded data when there are durable fragments but not enough to reconstruct. * Fixed 500 from cname_lookup middleware. Previously, if the looked-up domain was used by domain_remap to update the request path, the server would respond Internal Error. * The bulk extract middleware once again allows clients to specify metadata (including expiration timestamps) for all objects in the archive. * Errors encountered while validating static symlink targets no longer cause BadResponseLength errors in the proxy-server. * Fixed some SignatureDoesNotMatch errors when using the AWS .NET SDK. * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.

Before restarting haproxy, the amphora-agent dumps the state of the
servers in a file, so when haproxy reloads, it can recover the operating
state of its backends' members.
But with haproxy 2.4 (in Centos 9 Stream), it fails with a ""corrupted
global server state file"" error when reading this file. It seems that
most recent haproxy releases have a more strict validation of the format
of the file and ensure that it is terminated with a newline.

This commit adds a newline to the file (all the responses to haproxy
queries are stripped in the amphora-agent). It fixes the issue on Centos
9 Stream (and turns off a warning on Ubuntu).

At the moment, we are actually going ahead and sending
an API request for every single member when doing a batch
update, this can be very expensive in large number of
members and will cause a big hit against the Neutron API,
it potentially also makes those API calls timeout.

This patch instead implements a simple cache (per batch
call) to simply store the subnets which are considered valid
which means that it will make significantly less calls,
potentially even one.

It also adjusts the behaviour so that it only runs this on newly
added members which should avoid running it for deleted and
updated members which won't have an effect in this change.

Before restarting haproxy, the amphora-agent dumps the state of the
servers in a file, so when haproxy reloads, it can recover the operating
state of its backends' members.
But with haproxy 2.4 (in Centos 9 Stream), it fails with a ""corrupted

most recent haproxy releases have a more strict validation of the format
of the file and ensure that it is terminated with a newline.

This commit adds a newline to the file (all the responses to haproxy

9 Stream (and turns off a warning on Ubuntu).

There may be circumstances when an internal client wishes to modify
container sysmeta that is hidden from the user. It is desirable that
this happens without modifying the put-timestamp and therefore the
last-modified time that is reported in responses to client HEADs and
GETs.

This patch modifies the container server so that a POST will not
update the container put_timestamp if an X-Backend-No-Timestamp-Update
header is included with the request and has a truthy value.

Note: there are already circumstances in which container sysmeta is
modified without changing the put_timestamp:

 - PUT requests with shard range content do not update put_timestamp.
 - the sharder updates sysmeta directly via the ContainerBroker without
   modifying put_timestamp.

The metadata port fixed IPs depend on the subnets ""enabled_dhcp"" flag.
If the subnet has this flag disabled, the metadata port doesn't receive
an IP on the subnet CIDR.

The method ``create_metadata_port`` should explicitly define what fixed
IPs should request the metadata port during the creating depending on
the subnets ""enabled_dhcp"" flag.

When networks are created using REST APIs, if the MTU isn't specified
in the request, then a default value of 0 is used. Some use cases, such
as the auto-allocated-topology workflow, call the plugin directly to
create networks, bypassing the layer that inserts this default value.
Commit 68625686a40b3eb75502c8116f23d2297e288ca1 introduced a different
default value at the DB layer, defined by a constant in neutron-lib.
If the maximum MTU size has been configured lower than this constant,
then the user receives an exception, even though they didn't provide
a value for MTU.

This patch changes the default value used in the DB layer, so that
it's consistent with the workflow seen via REST APIs.

Libvirt 7.7 changed the mdev device naming to include the parent PCI
device when listing node devices. The domain, however, will still only
see the UUID and not see the parent PCI device. Changing the parsing to
simply drop the PCI identifier is not enough as the device cannot be
found when attempting to lookup the new ID.

Modify the Libvirt Driver's _get_mediated_device_information to tolerate
different formats of the mdev name. This first uses the legacy behavior
by trying to lookup the device name that is passed in (typically
mdev_<uuid> format) and if that is not found, iterates the list of mdev
node devices until the right UUID is found and selects that one.

Note that the lookup of the mdev device by UUID are needed in order
to keep the ability to recreate assigned mediated devices on a reboot of
the compute node.

Additionally, the libvirt utils parsing method mdev_name2uuid, has
been updated to tolerate both mdev_<uuid> and mdev_<uuid>_<pciid>
formats.

The Cinder NVMeoF deployment YAML has a couple of issues addressed in
this patch:

- Incorrect port is being used. According to the NVM Express specs: ""TCP
  port 4420 has been assigned for use by NVMe over Fabrics"". And that's
  the port default in Cinder as well.

- Instead of loading ``nvme-rdma`` we should load ``nvme-fabrics`` so it
  will automatically load the right module when connecting (``nvme-tcp``
  or ``nvme-rdma``).

- There is no need to load ``nvme`` module, since that's only used for
  local nvme volumes, and we care about remote modules.

- Controller nodes also connect to storage (for example for backups), so
  we need to load ``nvme-fabrics`` there as well.

- An iptables rule to allow port 4420 is needed, just like the one we
  have for iscsi (port 3260).

- Add a new CinderEnableNVMeOFBackend parameter, which triggers
  the configuration of the LVM volumes, mirroring the behavior
  of CinderEnableIscsiBackend.

The Cinder NVMeoF deployment YAML has a couple of issues addressed in
this patch:

- Incorrect port is being used. According to the NVM Express specs: ""TCP
  port 4420 has been assigned for use by NVMe over Fabrics"". And that's
  the port default in Cinder as well.

- Instead of loading ``nvme-rdma`` we should load ``nvme-fabrics`` so it
  will automatically load the right module when connecting (``nvme-tcp``
  or ``nvme-rdma``).

- There is no need to load ``nvme`` module, since that's only used for
  local nvme volumes, and we care about remote modules.

- Controller nodes also connect to storage (for example for backups), so
  we need to load ``nvme-fabrics`` there as well.

- An iptables rule to allow port 4420 is needed, just like the one we
  have for iscsi (port 3260).

- Add a new CinderEnableNVMeOFBackend parameter, which triggers
  the configuration of the LVM volumes, mirroring the behavior
  of CinderEnableIscsiBackend.

ceph pool creation failure

During `openstack overcloud deploy`, ceph create pool operation
fails on RHSCSv6 as the podman command generated by 'ceph_pool'
ansible module has the volume argument as /etc/ceph.

This patch ensures to use the '/var/lib/ceph/$FSID/config/'
in the podman command generated by all the ansible moduels.

Even the 'tripleo_cephadm_ceph_cli' is updated to use the
new path.

We've had SLO for nearly ten years, and it is preferable for most
use-cases. It's time to default to SLO rather than DLO.

Add a new --use-dlo option to give users a way to return to old
behavior; ensure there is still a --use-slo option so we don't break
existing scripts that may use it.

UpgradeImpact:
==============
The default segmented-upload behavior has changed; Static Large Objects
are now used by default rather than Dynamic Large Objects. To revert to
the old behavior:

* CLI users may use the new `--use-dlo` option
* Service API users may explicitly set `use_slo` to False in their
  options dicts

The metadata port fixed IPs depend on the subnets ""enabled_dhcp"" flag.
If the subnet has this flag disabled, the metadata port doesn't receive
an IP on the subnet CIDR.

The method ``create_metadata_port`` should explicitly define what fixed
IPs should request the metadata port during the creating depending on
the subnets ""enabled_dhcp"" flag.

The cephfs-nfs job was turned off [1] for perma-failing.
This commit adds the original non-voting job back into the
check queue and fixes some installation issues:

1) use ceph ""quincy"" release: Ceph Pacific's end of life
   is 2023-06-01 [2]. The manila community thinks deployers
   are more likely to use quincy with the 2023.2 (bobcat)
   release of OpenStack.
2) run the job with centos-stream-9: There are no packages
   currently available for Jammy Jellyfish on download.ceph.com [3].
   The OS shouldn't really matter for this CI job that is meant to
   test feature functionality provided by manila. At this time, we'd
   like to stick with builds provided by the ceph community instead
   of the distro since it may take a while to get bugfixes into distro
   builds.
3) The install script uses ""nfs-ganesha"" builds for ubuntu and
   centos hosted by the nfs-ganesha community [4]. We will not rely on
   the ceph community to provide the latest builds for
   nfs-ganesha any longer.

This commit also cleans up the unnecessary condition in the
ceph script file pertaining to configuring ceph packages for
Jammy Jellyfish. This step wasn't doing anything.
Ubuntu packages don't work at the moment and that requires some more
investigation.

Libvirt 7.7 changed the mdev device naming to include the parent PCI
device when listing node devices. The domain, however, will still only
see the UUID and not see the parent PCI device. Changing the parsing to
simply drop the PCI identifier is not enough as the device cannot be
found when attempting to lookup the new ID.

Modify the Libvirt Driver's _get_mediated_device_information to tolerate
different formats of the mdev name. This first uses the legacy behavior
by trying to lookup the device name that is passed in (typically
mdev_<uuid> format) and if that is not found, iterates the list of mdev
node devices until the right UUID is found and selects that one.

Note that the lookup of the mdev device by UUID are needed in order
to keep the ability to recreate assigned mediated devices on a reboot of
the compute node.

Additionally, the libvirt utils parsing method mdev_name2uuid, has
been updated to tolerate both mdev_<uuid> and mdev_<uuid>_<pciid>
formats.

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect

will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when
the requirements repository branches.

Until the requirements repository has as stable/2023.1 branch, tests will

When networks are created using REST APIs, if the MTU isn't specified
in the request, then a default value of 0 is used. Some use cases, such
as the auto-allocated-topology workflow, call the plugin directly to
create networks, bypassing the layer that inserts this default value.
Commit 68625686a40b3eb75502c8116f23d2297e288ca1 introduced a different
default value at the DB layer, defined by a constant in neutron-lib.
If the maximum MTU size has been configured lower than this constant,
then the user receives an exception, even though they didn't provide
a value for MTU.

This patch changes the default value used in the DB layer, so that
it's consistent with the workflow seen via REST APIs.

When networks are created using REST APIs, if the MTU isn't specified
in the request, then a default value of 0 is used. Some use cases, such
as the auto-allocated-topology workflow, call the plugin directly to
create networks, bypassing the layer that inserts this default value.
Commit 68625686a40b3eb75502c8116f23d2297e288ca1 introduced a different
default value at the DB layer, defined by a constant in neutron-lib.
If the maximum MTU size has been configured lower than this constant,
then the user receives an exception, even though they didn't provide
a value for MTU.

This patch changes the default value used in the DB layer, so that
it's consistent with the workflow seen via REST APIs.

A single paragraph of prose that operators can understand. The title and this first paragraph should be used as the subject line and body of the commit message respectively. Some notes about the nova-spec and blueprint process: * Not all blueprints need a spec. For more information see https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/contributor/blueprints.html#specs * The aim of this document is first to define the problem we need to solve, and second agree the overall approach to solve that problem. * This is not intended to be extensive documentation for a new feature. For example, there is no need to specify the exact configuration changes, nor the exact details of any DB model changes. But you should still define that such changes are required, and be clear on how that will affect upgrades. * You should aim to get your spec approved before writing your code. While you are free to write prototypes and code before getting your spec approved, its possible that the outcome of the spec review process leads you towards a fundamentally different solution than you first envisaged. * But, API changes are held to a much higher level of scrutiny. As soon as an API change merges, we must assume it could be in production somewhere, and as such, we then need to support that API change forever. To avoid getting that wrong, we do want lots of details about API changes upfront. Some notes about using this template: * Your spec should be in ReSTructured text, like this template. * Please wrap text at 79 columns. * The filename in the git repository should match the launchpad URL, for example a URL of: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/awesome-thing should be named awesome-thing.rst * Please do not delete any of the sections in this template. If you have nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None * For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html * To test out your formatting, build the docs using tox and see the generated HTML file in doc/build/html/specs/<path_of_your_file> * If you would like to provide a diagram with your spec, ascii diagrams are required. http://asciiflow.com/ is a very nice tool to assist with making ascii diagrams. The reason for this is that the tool used to review specs is based purely on plain text. Plain text will allow review to proceed without having to look at additional files which can not be viewed in gerrit. It will also allow inline feedback on the diagram itself. * If your specification proposes any changes to the Nova REST API such as changing parameters which can be returned or accepted, or even the semantics of what happens when a client calls into the API, then you should add the APIImpact flag to the commit message. Specifications with the APIImpact flag can be found with the following query: https://review.openstack.org/#/q/status:open+project:openstack/nova-specs+message:apiimpact,n,z Problem description =================== A detailed description of the problem. What problem is this blueprint addressing? Use Cases --------- What use cases does this address? What impact on actors does this change have? Ensure you are clear about the actors in each use case: Developer, End User, Deployer etc. Proposed change =============== Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How do you propose to solve this problem? If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In other words, what's the scope of this effort? At this point, if you would like to just get feedback on if the problem and proposed change fit in nova, you can stop here and post this for review to get preliminary feedback. If so please say: Posting to get preliminary feedback on the scope of this spec. Alternatives ------------ What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one. Data model impact ----------------- Changes which require modifications to the data model often have a wider impact on the system. The community often has strong opinions on how the data model should be evolved, from both a functional and performance perspective. It is therefore important to capture and gain agreement as early as possible on any proposed changes to the data model. Questions which need to be addressed by this section include: * What new data objects and/or database schema changes is this going to require? * What database migrations will accompany this change. * How will the initial set of new data objects be generated, for example if you need to take into account existing instances, or modify other existing data describe how that will work. REST API impact --------------- Each API method which is either added or changed should have the following * Specification for the method * A description of what the method does suitable for use in user documentation * Method type (POST/PUT/GET/DELETE) * Normal http response code(s) * Expected error http response code(s) * A description for each possible error code should be included describing semantic errors which can cause it such as inconsistent parameters supplied to the method, or when an instance is not in an appropriate state for the request to succeed. Errors caused by syntactic problems covered by the JSON schema definition do not need to be included. * URL for the resource * URL should not include underscores, and use hyphens instead. * Parameters which can be passed via the url * JSON schema definition for the request body data if allowed * Field names should use snake_case style, not CamelCase or MixedCase style. * JSON schema definition for the response body data if any * Field names should use snake_case style, not CamelCase or MixedCase style. * Example use case including typical API samples for both data supplied by the caller and the response * Discuss any policy changes, and discuss what things a deployer needs to think about when defining their policy. Example JSON schema definitions can be found in the Nova tree https://opendev.org/openstack/nova/src/branch/master/nova/api/openstack/compute/schemas Note that the schema should be defined as restrictively as possible. Parameters which are required should be marked as such and only under exceptional circumstances should additional parameters which are not defined in the schema be permitted (eg additionaProperties should be False). Reuse of existing predefined parameter types such as regexps for passwords and user defined names is highly encouraged. Security impact --------------- Describe any potential security impact on the system. Some of the items to consider include: * Does this change touch sensitive data such as tokens, keys, or user data? * Does this change alter the API in a way that may impact security, such as a new way to access sensitive information or a new way to login? * Does this change involve cryptography or hashing? * Does this change require the use of sudo or any elevated privileges? * Does this change involve using or parsing user-provided data? This could be directly at the API level or indirectly such as changes to a cache layer. * Can this change enable a resource exhaustion attack, such as allowing a single API interaction to consume significant server resources? Some examples of this include launching subprocesses for each connection, or entity expansion attacks in XML. For more detailed guidance, please see the OpenStack Security Guidelines as a reference (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/Guidelines). These guidelines are a work in progress and are designed to help you identify security best practices. For further information, feel free to reach out to the OpenStack Security Group at openstack-security@lists.openstack.org. Notifications impact -------------------- Please specify any changes to notifications. Be that an extra notification, changes to an existing notification, or removing a notification. Consider proposing changes to the versioned notifications: * When the feature adds or removes fields to the API responses. For example when the feature adds a new field to the ``GET /servers`` API response consider adding similar information to the payload of the instance action notifications * When the feature adds a new action to the existing API entities. For example adding a new action to the server might mean you want to emit a corresponding new instance action notification * When the feature adds a new resource (noun) to the REST API consider adding new notifications about the creation and deletion of such resource Other end user impact --------------------- Aside from the API, are there other ways a user will interact with this feature? * Does this change have an impact on python-novaclient and openstack client? What does the user interface there look like? Performance Impact ------------------ Describe any potential performance impact on the system, for example how often will new code be called, and is there a major change to the calling pattern of existing code. Examples of things to consider here include: * A periodic task might look like a small addition but if it calls conductor or another service the load is multiplied by the number of nodes in the system. * Scheduler filters get called once per host for every instance being created, so any latency they introduce is linear with the size of the system. * A small change in a utility function or a commonly used decorator can have a large impacts on performance. * Calls which result in a database queries (whether direct or via conductor) can have a profound impact on performance when called in critical sections of the code. * Will the change include any locking, and if so what considerations are there on holding the lock? Other deployer impact --------------------- Discuss things that will affect how you deploy and configure OpenStack that have not already been mentioned, such as: * What config options are being added? Should they be more generic than proposed (for example a flag that other hypervisor drivers might want to implement as well)? Are the default values ones which will work well in real deployments? * Is this a change that takes immediate effect after its merged, or is it something that has to be explicitly enabled? * If this change is a new binary, how would it be deployed? * Please state anything that those doing continuous deployment, or those upgrading from the previous release, need to be aware of. Also describe any plans to deprecate configuration values or features. For example, if we change the directory name that instances are stored in, how do we handle instance directories created before the change landed? Do we move them? Do we have a special case in the code? Do we assume that the operator will recreate all the instances in their cloud? Developer impact ---------------- Discuss things that will affect other developers working on OpenStack, such as: * If the blueprint proposes a change to the driver API, discussion of how other hypervisors would implement the feature is required. Upgrade impact -------------- Describe any potential upgrade impact on the system, such as: * If this change adds a new feature to the compute host that the controller services rely on, the controller services may need to check the minimum compute service version in the deployment before using the new feature. For example, in Ocata, the FilterScheduler did not use the Placement API until all compute services were upgraded to at least Ocata. * While we strive to have feature parity between all virt drivers, it is not uncommon for one virt driver to implement a new feature exposed out of the API before the others. For example, extending the size of an attached volume. Since Nova does not yet have any type of sophisticated *capabilities* API so a user can know what actions can be performed on a given instance, consider adding a new policy rule to at least let operators that cannot support a virt-specific feature disable it in their cloud which is at least presented to the user in an understandable way by getting a ``403 Forbidden`` error. * Nova supports N-1 version *nova-compute* services for rolling upgrades. Does the proposed change need to consider older code running that may impact how the new change functions, for example, by changing or overwriting global state in the database? This is generally most problematic when making changes that involve multiple compute hosts, like move operations such as migrate, resize, unshelve and evacuate. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: <launchpad-id or None> Other contributors: <launchpad-id or None> Feature Liaison --------------- Ideally feature work is sponsored by a member of the `nova core team`_ or other experienced and active nova developer. The purpose of a liaison is to: * Mentor developers through the arcana of nova's development processes. * Advocate for (aka ""care about"") the feature to the rest of the nova team. * Be the initial go-to for reviews. See the :ref:`feature-liaisons` for more details. Feature liaison: <name and/or nick> * Feature liaison is optional. However we suggest to find a liaison for your feature as it will help getting your feature merged. The :ref:`feature-liaisons` has details about how to find a liaison for your work. * If you do not already have agreement from a nova developer to act as your liaison, you may write ""Liaison Needed"" here and/or in your commit message. * If you are a core or experienced nova dev, you need not have a separate liaison; if you wish, you may just assign yourself, or put ""None""/""N/A"". .. _`nova core team`: https://review.opendev.org/#/admin/groups/25,members Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Consider creating an ordering of patches, that allows gradually merging instead of the need to merge them all at once. For example if you are introducing a feature that requires implementation changes in multiple VM lifecycle operations then first add a step that rejects all the not yet supported actions with a HTTP 400 Bad Request. The error should explain that the <operation> is not supported with <feature> at this time. Then gradually remove the limitation as you progress with the implementation. This way we can merge your changes gradually and regardless when the feature freeze hit we can be sure that the system is consistent. Dependencies ============ * Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in nova, or in other projects, that this one either depends on or is related to. * If this requires functionality of another project that is not currently used by Nova (such as the glance v2 API when we previously only required v1), document that fact. * Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not included in OpenStack? Or does it depend on a specific version of library? Testing ======= Please discuss the important scenarios needed to test here, as well as specific edge cases we should be ensuring work correctly. For each scenario please specify if this requires specialized hardware, a full openstack environment, or can be simulated inside the Nova tree. Please discuss how the change will be tested. We especially want to know what tempest tests will be added. It is assumed that unit test coverage will be added so that doesn't need to be mentioned explicitly, but discussion of why you think unit tests are sufficient and we don't need to add more tempest tests would need to be included. Is this untestable in gate given current limitations (specific hardware / software configurations available)? If so, are there mitigation plans (3rd party testing, gate enhancements, etc). Documentation Impact ==================== Which audiences are affected most by this change, and which documentation titles on docs.openstack.org should be updated because of this change? Don't repeat details discussed above, but reference them here in the context of documentation for multiple audiences. For example, the Operations Guide targets cloud operators, and the End User Guide would need to be updated if the change offers a new feature available through the CLI or dashboard. If a config option changes or is deprecated, note here that the documentation needs to be updated to reflect this specification's change. References ========== Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any reference. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are: * Links to mailing list or IRC discussions * Links to notes from a summit session * Links to relevant research, if appropriate * Related specifications as appropriate (e.g. if it's an EC2 thing, link the EC2 docs) * Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to History ======= Optional section intended to be used each time the spec is updated to describe new design, API or any database schema updated. Useful to let reader understand what's happened along the time. .. list-table:: Revisions :header-rows: 1 * - Release Name - Description * - 2023.2 Bobcat - Introduced ",,472,0

FFUv3 (Train->Wallaby) and mixed-rhel stories require possibility to
run modular libvirt on el9 hypervisors and monolithic libvirt on el8.

It is not clear yet if we might need a new ComputeEL8 role, or not.
Create legacy service OS::TripleO::Services::NovaLibvirtLegacy to run
monolithic libvirt on such computes that are supposed to stay on

The ""ubuntu"" target had a post-install 99-autoremove task that removed
unnecessary dependency packages, but the ""ubuntu-minimal"" target does not.
This patch moves the 99-autoremove post-install task from the ""ubuntu"" target
to the ""ubuntu-common"" target so that both will run an autoremove at the end of
the image build.
For the Octavia amphora image, this saved about 1GB in the image by removing
build only package dependencies.

For historical reasons the ``haproxy_service_configs`` variable was
a list of nested mappings with only single valid key for the top
level mapping.

There have been no use-cases for extra keys, so this patch simplifies
the code by removing one level of nesting.

As of Zed jsonschema version has been bumped to 4.14.0 in
upper-constraints, which means project should support running with
this version. This patch aims to fix ApiValidator that is not compatible
with new jsonschema.

Other deprecations, like FormatChecker.cls_checks decorator are left
intact and must be covered with follow-up patches.

We also move zuul queues to project scope as otherwise jobs do not
run due to config error.

We also replace iteritems with six method as iteritems have been dropped
from Python 3.

Previously, ""share network create"" command was trying to look up
the availability-zone provided by the user. However, this is not supported
by the AvailabilityZoneManager.

Drop the AZ lookup if the option is used and pass the user provided value

Change[1] modified how --limit option, used together with skiplist,
works in ussuri and onwards. For overcloud update run the change poses
some problems, because when update run is triggered --limit option is
used to run control sequence of nodes being updated. As a result
skiplisted nodes can be added to update run unintentionally.

With this fix `excluded_overcloud` group is added to --limit flag to
exclude all nodes in skiplist when update run is triggered.
`excluded_overcloud` group is added only when skiplist contains any host

following cases:

Currently nova::migration::libvirt tries to look up the manage_service
parameter from nova::compute::libvirt. This lookup was required when
we had to introduced support for sockets but this logic can sometimes
cause problems, mainly because it does not work properly in case
the migration class is included before the compute class.

This introduces the new parameter so that users can enforce the class

When your booting a Linux system using dracut, i.e. with any
redhat style distribution, dracut's internal code looks to validate
the kernel hmac signature in before proceeding to userspace.

It does this by looking at the /boot/ folder file for the kernel
hmac file.

And it normally does this with the root filesystem. Except if the
kernel is not on the root filesystem and is instead on a /boot
filesystem, this breaks horribly. This is compounded because
DIB enables the operator to restructure the OS image/layout
to fit their needs. In order for this to be navigated, as dracut
is written, we need to pass a ""boot="" argument to the kernel.

So now we attempt to purge any prior boot entry in the disk image
content, which is good because any filesystem operations invalidate
it, and then we attempt to identify the boot filesystem, and save a
boot kernel command line parameter so the resulting image can
boot properly if FIPS was enabled in the prior image.

Regex developed with https://sed.js.org utilizing stdin:

VAR=""quiet boot=UUID=173c759f-1302-48a3-9d51-a17784c21e03 text""
VAR=""quiet boot=PARTUUID=173c759f-1302-48a3-9d51-a17784c21e03""
VAR=""quiet boot=PARTUUID=173c759f-1302-48a3-9d51-a17784c21e03 reboot=meow""
VAR=""quiet boot=UUID=/dev/sda1 text""
VAR=""quiet boot=/dev/sda1""
VAR=""quiet boot=/dev/sda1 reboot=meow""
VAR=""quiet after_boot=1 reboot=meow boot=/dev/sda1""
VAR=""quiet after_boot=1 reboot=meow""

Which resulted in stdout:

VAR=""quiet reboot=meow""
VAR=""quiet after_boot=1 reboot=meow""

When we perform reimage operation, we check the image metadata
like we do when creating a bootable volume from image.
If the metadata check fails for any reason like image status is
not active or image size or virtual size is bigger than volume
size, we fail the operation but the volume stays in downloading
state.
This patch adds the handling when the image metadata check fails
we revert the volume status to it's original status.

Closes-Bug: #1982436

The `diskimage-builder` command provides a yaml file based interface
to `disk-image-create` and `ramdisk-image-create`. Every argument to
these scripts has a YAML equivalent. The command has the following
features:
- Environment values can be provided from the calling environment as
  well as YAML
- All arguments are validated with jsonschema in the most appropriate
  YAML type
- Schema is self-documenting and printed when running with --help
- Multiple YAML files can be specified and each file can have multiple
  images defined
- Entries with duplicate image names will be merged into a single
  image build, with attributes overwritten, elements appended, and
  environment values updated/overwritten. A missing image name implies
  the same image name as the previous entry.
- --dry-run and --stop-on-failure flags

A simple YAML defintion would resemble:

- imagename: centos-minimal
  checksum: true
  install-type: package
  elements: [centos, vm]
- imagename: ironic-python-agent
  elements:
  - ironic-python-agent-ramdisk
  - extra-hardware

The TripleO project has managed image build options with YAML files
and it has proved useful having git history and a diff friendly
format, specifically for the following situations:
- Managing differences between distros (centos, rhel)
- Managing changes in major distro releases (centos-8, centos-9-stream)
- Managing the python2 to python3 transition, within and across major
  distro releases

Now that the TripleO toolchain is being retired this tool is being
proposed to be used for the image builds of TripleO's successor, as
well as the rest of the community.

Subsequent commits will add documentation and switch some tests to
using `diskimage-builder`.

The Stein release does away with the concept of built in notifications,
in favour of treating all notification types equally.

This patch fixes an issue with the DB schema migration associated
with this change, which will fail if any notifications using
built-in notification types are configured at the time of the upgrade.

This refactor paves the way to support continuous control plane test.

Added:
- trigger error when openstack command fails during creation;
- add a trap exit to make sure cleanup is always trigger in sanity;
- add a sanityfast mode to fail fast during continuous testing;
- add more test on created resources like cinder vol and fip;
- remove leftover ~/instance_.. file during sanity;

Sanity mode, we add a trap exit to support cleanup. This ensures that
cleanup is triggered if any openstack command fail, we don't need
explicit test.

During the teardow, we don't trigger new error for openstack command
as the state of the overcloud is at that point unknown and the best
course of action is just to return an error at that point.

By default ha-promote-on-shutdown=when-synced. However we are seeing
issues with RabbitMQ automatically recovering when nodes are restarted.
https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html#cluster-shutdown

Rather than waiting for operator interventions, it is better we allow
recovery to happen, even if that means we may loose some messages.
A few failed and timed out operations is better than a totaly broken
cloud. This is achieved using ha-promote-on-shutdown=always.

Note, when a node failure is detected, this is already the default
behaviour from 3.7.5 onwards:
https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html#promoting-unsynchronised-mirrors

This patch adds the option to change the ha-promote-on-shutdown
definition, using the flag `rabbitmq_ha_promote_on_shutdown`. This
value is unset by default to avoid any unexpected changes to the
RabbitMQ definitions.json file, as that would trigger an unexpected
restart of RabbitMQ during the next deploy.

result3 does not invoke message.clean() when an exception is thrown
by `message.connection.result3()` call, causing pool connection
associated with the message to be marked active forever. This causes

The metadata port fixed IPs depend on the subnets ""enabled_dhcp"" flag.
If the subnet has this flag disabled, the metadata port doesn't receive

The ``neutron-remove-duplicated-port-bindings`` script removes the
duplicated port binding registers (""ml2_port_bindings"" table) that
have status=INACTIVE.

This patch also removes the corresponding port binding levels
(""ml2_port_binding_levels"" table) associated to those inactive port
bindings.

The current document states that O flag will be 1 when ipv6_ra_mode is

This actual behavior looks correct because O flag can be either 1 or 0
when M flag is 1, according to the following statement of RFC 4861:

  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-4.2
  If the M flag is set, the O flag is redundant and can be ignored
  because DHCPv6 will return all available configuration information.

To make consistency between the documet and actually behavior, this
commit changes the document to state that O flag can be either 1 or 0
when ipv6_ra_mode is dhcpv6_stateful.

This change allows specifying different volume sizes and types for
master and worker nodes. Volume types can be specified independent of
size setting - falling back to boot_volume_size if specific node volume
size label is not declared.

New labels added:
 - master_volume_size

Cinder generally supports defining multiple backends using the same
driver. This means we have to expect the case cinder::backend::foo is
used multiple times. However some of the defined types include the raw
package resources which causes duplicate declarations.

This fixes that and ensure we avoid duplication by ensure_packages.
