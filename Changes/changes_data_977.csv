The selector for setting the default project passes on an empty string
if the value is not changed. This is causing an error from keystone as
an empty string is not a valid project ID.

To fix, a couple of things have been done:

First, as user_update is a PATCH, we no longer pass on the default
project as a parameter in the update when using keystone v3
and the value did not change when editing the user.

Second, there is currently no way to unset the default project
using keystoneclient. An entry in the default project select
""select a project"" has been removed when the default project is
already set. The entry was selectable and resulted in the
problematic empty string. The current default project is already
selected at load time. The ability to select a different default
project is maintained.

Additionally, keystone v2.0 functionality is not effected, as the
default project id is required in v2.0.

A test was added to cover the case of editing the default project.

As of today the current resolution gives:: Should the nomination period for Program Technical Lead close and any program subject to the decisions of the Technical Committee not have a minimum of one eligible candidate identify themselves, the following process will be used to determine leadership for any program in this situation. 1. Programs without a minimum of one eligible candidate are identified to the Technical Committee by the Election Officials, as soon as possible after the nomination period has expired. 2. The Technical Committee can appoint a leader to any programs in this situation, by mutual agreement of the Technical Committee and the proposed appointee. 3. The appointed leader has all the same obligations and responsibilities as a self-nominated elected Program Technical Lead. An additional item is proposed in the case where a program is leaderless and inactive: 4. The Technical Committee can agree to remove a program from OpenStack due to inactivity and being leaderless at time of elections. This program will then reside in the list of `retired projects`_. .. _inactive programs without a leader: http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/meetings/tc/2015/tc.2015-09-29-20.01.log.html#l-342 .. _program being removed: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/governance/commit/reference/projects.yaml?id=05dd9e1b33d34001de5be7c33fcc851f7aabc6e7 .. _retired projects: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/governance/tree/reference/retired-projects.yaml ",,39,0

Test names containing '/' characters currently raise 404 errors for
the '/test_runs/` route because flask considers it a separate route.
This changes the route parameter's type to 'path' to allow the '/'

During indexing, incoming events are processed into both the old and new indices. Once indexing is complete, an Elasticsearch alias is used to switch searches seamlessly onto the new index, at which time the old one is removed. - Plugin configuration refers to `resource_group_name` rather than `index_name` to represent groups of resources separate from the logical Elasticsearch index. This setting is used to determine index and alias names. issues: - Reindexing must now take place across all resource types that share the index (it is not possible to re-index a specific resource type). This is a limitation that Elasticsearch 2.x would likely have forced upon us anyway. A subsequent patch will allow more efficient reindexing for associated resource types. ",,35,0

This is a first iteration of testing IPv6 deployment.
This patch will deploy scenario002 on centos7 by using IPv6 network.

To make it work on Ubuntu, it will require more work, that will be done
in future iterations. During my testing, I found some bugs and did not
investigate because I wanted a first scenario working on v6.

Same for scenario001 and scenario003, they'll be tested later.

Change I01b22593724616bc0a7793c509ecabf095d6927d made the
live_migrate() method in the ServerManager conditional on the
API version requested. This broke the host-evacuate-live
command which is calling ServerManager.live_migrate() directly
with one too many arguments for the v2.25 version of the method.

This updates the host-evacuate-live shell to behave like the
live-migration method and be aware of the API version when
calling the live_migrate() method.

In the group_vars pip_get_pip_options is set with the intention
of restricting the initial pip install to using the local repo
server first, then reaching out to a set upstream repo.
The pip install role then has a fallback which ignores these
settings and goes to pypi to fetch the versions required.

While this works, it causes an initial failure to install pip
when the repo server is not yet available. This is OK considering
that there isa fallback, but when other pip install options
need to be used (eg: proxy options, certificate validation
disabling due to bad proxies) then circumstances are reached
where both tasks will fail and pip is uninstallable.

Going back to the original intent, the use of this setting in
group_vars is a logic flaw. If there's a repo server already,
then everywhere where it matters the pip_lock_down role would
have already restricted pip install options to make use of the
local repo server for the first task in pip_install anyway. In
other words we're double-doing the lock down unnecessarily.

This patch results in the following behaviour:

- The first pip install task will look for the versions specified
  in the local repo if there is one and the pip_lock_down task has
  run on the host in question.
- If there is no local pip.conf, the first pip install task will
  seek the packages from pypi.
- If the deployer chooses to set 'pip_get_pip_options' in
  user_variables, then those options will be honoured.

This patch paves the way for https://review.openstack.org/296114
to actually be something useful to have merged.

Currently, since creating or updating a domain config is
done as a sequence of option creates/updates, it is possible
for other keystone threads/processes to see a partial update
if the cache timeout occurs in the middle of such an update.

This patch makes the creation/updating of a domain config
atomic (by doing it all within a common sql session), hence
avoiding this issue.

This issue has not been reported in the field - and is extremely
difficult to test, so we are relying on code inspection to
convince ourselves we have solved this issue.

Since the domain config API is still marked as experimental, we
do not gurantee backward compatability for the driver. Hence,
although this patch modifies the driver interface, it does not
include a new versioned driver.

This play is no longer used and is a hold over from the time
when the OpenStack-Ansible project came from the Rackspace
Private Cloud product. Being this is not a play used by
the core project it should be removed.

This change also resolves an issue/misconseption that using
the clone play is a better/more stable way to build/deploy
an OpenStack cloud using OpenStack-Ansible.

This patch changes the nova providers to use puppet-openstacklib's
authentication methods, which use python-openstackclient as an interface,
instead of the nova command line client.

The benefits of this is a code reduction. This patch reduces the amount
of code in the nova parent provider and nova providers by reusing code from
Puppet::Provider::Openstack instead of implementing authentication,
retries, and response parsing in the provider.

This patch doesn't affect next providers:

 * nova_network and nova_floating:
   openstack client has small functionality for managing nova floatings
   and doesn't provide possibility to manage nova-networks,
   so keeping old format of auth for this providers.
   Also Nova-Network is deprecated.
 * nova_cell:
   openstack client doesn't provide possibility to manage cells;
 * nova security groups - will be done in separate patch;

Additional reasoning for this change is in the blueprint.

Also added new tests for providers.

This would allow me to perform configuration change and maintenance of my cluster with ability to do troubleshooting and audit of things happening in the cluster. -------------------- Problem description -------------------- Currently, it is almost impossible for any Fuel user to understand the history of changes happened to his cluster. This puts a barrier onto adoption of Fuel as not only as an OpenStack installer, but also as a cloud management tool. This change proposes to store all the information about particular deployment tasks ever executed for each particular cluster. This would allow for anyone to understand status of the cluster it is currently in, which tasks were ever ran and what could have possibly gone wrong. ---------------- Proposed changes ---------------- Main changes are going to happen within Nailgun Data Model. This assumes creation of additional relation in Nailgun DB that will store history of deployment tasks with relation to particular global Nailgun tasks. The other part that is going to be changed is Nailgun receiver module code that is going to update deployment tasks status. Web UI ====== None Nailgun ======= Modules to be changed: * add tasks history DB table * introduce tasks history table update in receiver * add reset api Data model ---------- Add new table tasks_history with the following scheme: FK deployment_task - ID of deploy task in Nailgun tasks table task_name - task name as in deployment_tasks.yaml, for example node_id - ID of the node where task is being run (was run) time_started - timestamp of task start time_ended - timestamp of task end status - enum of task statuses returned by astute - consult [0] task-based deployment blueprint task statuses for the details REST API -------- There will be a REST API handler allowing to get a list of tasks and (tentatively) particular task details in case of failure Orchestration ============= None RPC Protocol ------------ None Fuel Client =========== Add a command to list task statuses for particular Nailgun task Plugins ======= None Fuel Library ============ None -------------- Upgrade impact -------------- Should be disabled for pre-9.0 clusters --------------- Security impact --------------- None so far -------------------- Notifications impact -------------------- None --------------- End user impact --------------- Ability to easier troubleshoot and perform maintenance and day-2 operations ------------------ Performance impact ------------------ Insignificant ----------------- Deployment impact ----------------- None ---------------- Developer impact ---------------- None --------------------- Infrastructure impact --------------------- None -------------------- Documentation impact -------------------- None except for generic feature documentation -------------- Implementation -------------- Assignee(s) =========== Primary assignee: vsharshov Other contributors: bgaifullin ashtokolov Mandatory design review: ikalnitsky rustyrobot Work Items ========== * Add new relation for tasks history in the DB * Modify Receiver part to update tasks history DB * Add REST API list and show handlers Dependencies ============ ------------ Testing, QA ------------ Basic unit tests, scalability tests for 10000 transaction of Nailgun **deploy** tasks, simple functional testing.

This patch adds posibility to configure backend settings for Glare
service.

Since Glare service is experimental feature, it can be usually disabled
for deployment. Hence was added a optional parameter 'glare_enabled' for
each backend manifest. So, if Glare is enabled glance glare config

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================ Scheduling interaction for cells ================================ https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/cells-scheduling-interaction In order to schedule instance builds to compute hosts Nova and the scheduler will need to take into account that hosts are grouped into cells. It is not necessary that this is apparent when Nova is requesting a placement decision. Problem description =================== In order to partition Nova into cells the scheduler will need to be involved earlier in the build process. Use Cases ---------- * Operators want to partition their deployments into cells for scaling, failure domain, and buildout reasons. When partitioned, we need to have flexible scheduling that can make decisions on cells and hosts. Proposed change =============== The scheduler will be queried at the api level so that it knows which cell to pass the build to. The instance table exists in a cell and not in the api database, so to create an instance we will first need to know which cell to create it in. The scheduler will continue to return a (host, node) tuple and the calling service will look up the host in a mapping table to determine which cell it is in. This means the current select_destinations interface will not need to change. Querying the scheduler will take place after the API has returned a response so the most reasonable thing to do is pass the build request to a conductor operating outside of any cell. The conductor will call the scheduler and then create the instance in the cell and pass the build request to it. Rescheduling will still take place within a cell via the normal compute->conductor loop, using the conductors within the cell. Adding rescheduling at a cell level will be a later effort. Information about cells will need to be fed into the scheduler in order for it to account for that during its placement decisions, but that is outside the scope of this spec. Alternatives ------------ We could query the scheduler at two points like in cellsv1. This creates more deployment complexity and creates an unnecessary coupling between the architecture of Nova and the scheduler. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- Nova-conductor will need to be deployed for use by nova-api. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: alaski Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Add a conductor method to call the scheduler and then handle the latter half of what the api currently does for a build request(create instance in db and cast to the cell conductor). * Update the conductor build_instances interface to take a scheduling decision and not call the scheduler if it's provided. This allows for bypassing scheduling when it comes from the api conductor but still call the scheduler when a compute requests a reschedule. * Update devstack to spin up a conductor for use by the nova-api service. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Since this is designed to be an internal re-architecting of Nova with no user visible changes the current suite of Tempest or functional tests should suffice. At some point we will want to look at how to test multiple cells or potentially exposing the concept of a cell in the API and we will tackle testing requirements then. Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation will be written describing the flow of an instance build and how and where scheduling decisions are made.

This patch wires in ringbuilder.pp so that it is always
asserted like the other manifests and it fixes the misaligned
step sequencing in calling our overcloud controller manifests.

Previously it was called as a separate software deployment outside of
the hiera step sequence. This made things confusing in
controller-post.yaml since the deployment names didn't align

just like the other modules it should make gradually moving this

During indexing, incoming events are processed into both the old and new indices. Once indexing is complete, an Elasticsearch alias is used to switch searches seamlessly onto the new index, at which time the old one is removed. - Plugin configuration refers to `resource_group_name` rather than `index_name` to represent groups of resources separate from the logical Elasticsearch index. This setting is used to determine index and alias names. issues: - Reindexing must now take place across all resource types that share the index (it is not possible to re-index a specific resource type). This is a limitation that Elasticsearch 2.x would likely have forced upon us anyway. A subsequent patch will allow more efficient reindexing for associated resource types. ",,35,0

We need to reload/restart services on updates/upgrades to apply any
config changes, but restarting services managed from Pacemaker from
Puppet causes problems.

For now we no-op the restart and rely on the catch-all restart after
Puppet phase.

In the future we should have a service provider for pacemaker resources
that will be using pcs. We still might have to restart services outside
Puppet due to cluster-wide orchestration issues, but we might be able to
do the restarts selectively rather than restart everything.

We also no-op the start/stop commands to be safe, as it also doesn't
make sense for Puppet to try start and stop those services when it
doesn't have knowledge about Pacemaker.

This patch adds a new load consolidation strategy based on a heuristic
algorithm which focuses on measured CPU utilization and tries to
minimize hosts which have too much or too little load.
A new goal ""vm_workload_consolidation"" was added which executes
the strategy ""VM_WORKLOAD_CONSOLIDATION"".

We'd like to let the post puppet pacemaker controller services
restart to happen for the convergence step so set the
UpdateIdentifier. However also set the PackageUpdate to noop so the
yum_update.sh doesn't happen.

Since a full haproxy restart is expected, we no longer need the
systemctl reload added at Iae3bad745ecdf952a7a0314fe1375d07eb47c454
so remove that too.

A commit similar to this one was applied (and then reverted because of
some issues) some time ago to switch ISO to CentOS-7.2. When all issues
were resolved we finally have switched to CentOS-7 using intermediate
snapshots that updating constantly. A path to snapshot to use is passed

However, there are community builds that doesn't use snapshotting

A previous patch [1] mistakenly added a port detach call to the failover
flow.  It didn't cause failures due to a type-o in the arguments to the
call, so it would passively fail with a log entry.  However, if someone
fixed this it would cause failover to fail due to the port getting
deleted during the detach.
This patch removes that code.

Using of *regexValidator* and *validators* attributes with *password* field was introduced in version 2.3. By default, password should have at least 7 characters, 1 capital letter, 1 non-capital letter, 1 digit, and 1 special character. If you do not want password validation to be so strong, you can override it by setting a custom validator or multiple validators for password. For that add *regexValidator* or *validators* to the *password* field and specify custom regex string as value, just like with any *string* field. *Example* .. code-block:: yaml - name: password type: password label: Password descriptionTitle: Password description: >- Please, provide password for the application. Password should be 5-50 characters long and consist of alphanumeric characters regexpValidator: '^[a-zA-Z0-9]{5,50}?$' *Network* field itself and its specific attributes (*include_subnets*, *filter*, *murano_networks*, *allow_auto*) are available since version 2.1. Before that, there was no way for the end user to select existing network in the UI. The only way to change the default networking behavior was the usage of networking.yaml file which allows to override the networking setting at the environment level, for all the murano environments of all the tenants. Now you can simple add a *network* field to your form definition and provide the ability to select the desired network for specific application. *Example* .. code-block:: yaml - instanceConfiguration: fields: - name: network type: network label: Network description: Select a network to join. 'Auto' corresponds to a default environment's network. murano_networks: translate ", *string* field.,44,1

In testing it was discovered that a separate resource_pools
tables was not required. Instead the resource-providers table
itself could provide that and any given provider could provide
multiple resources classes, associated via the inventories
table.

Therefore, this adds 'name', 'generation', and 'can_host' columns
to resource_providers and changes an allocations index to add the
'used' column.

A 'resource_providers_aggregates' table is added to associate a
resource provider with an aggregate.

A unique constraint is added on the inventories table so that any
resource provider can have only one inventory for any given
resource class.

The test was deriving from NoDBTestCase to avoid setting up an api
database fixture it wasn't going to use. However, it isn't harmful
to set up the api fixture and deriving from test.TestCase prevents
the test from potentially breaking the global database state.

This also changes the test to use a non-admin context as use of
the admin context was unnecessary.

The reason for this bug is that the name is not validated when create
 role, domain and groups. In the V3 version we use jsonschema to
validate them. So I changed the code of schema files to validate
the name.

When I wrote the test code, I found that there was a lack of some tests
 in the file and then I added to write the test code.

There are at most 16 virtual disks that can be attached onto a SCSI
controller, while if the limitation is reached, error occurs
with message ""VMwareDriverException: Invalid configuration for
device '0'"".

The reason is that when the controller's quota is used up, a new
controller will be created automatically, but the newly-created
one will try to use bus number 0, which is already used my existing
controller.

This change will allocate a new free bus number for the newly-created
controller.

Since now we provide the original RequestSpec for move operations (unshelve,
live-migrate and evacuate), it can also provide the original force_hosts/nodes
to the scheduler.
In that case, it means that if an admin was asking to boot an instance forcing
to an host, a later move operation could then give again the forced value and
then wouldn't permit to get a different destination which is an issue.

TBH, that is not a problem for live-migrate and evacuate that do provide an
optional host value (which bypasses then the scheduler) but since unshelve
is not having this optional value, it would mean that we could only unshelve
an forced instance to the same host.

The old behavior takes a list of network names or id, ignores it and
picks the first external network it can find

This fix implements the actual logic of using the parameter:
 * Uses the given external network, if supplied. This changes to
   using only a single network instead of a list because no where
   is a list supplied to the call.
 * If no network is given, it takes the first external network.

(Shrews) The unit tests are also changed because they were suck.
The test for available_floating_ip() is changed to test only it's
calls and not the lower level functionality. New tests are added for
the _neutron_available_floating_ips() call, which implements the lower
level functionality and which is where this change is actually tested.

Currently we have retry logic with random period of delay.
There is a chance, when we have several re-try attemts with maximum
timeout, so it can be a root cause of floating fails, when we have not
enough time for getting all signals.

Also decrease number of signals from 30 to 25, due to small risk, when
one of signals goes to ConcurrentTransaction error.

Note, that all these changes are made in corresponding functional test
and don't affect main code.

This adds a min_version parameter to the yaml which lets us have a
standard way of displaying new microversion parameters.

Classes are added to rows which means we could display: none them if

It also removes the inline yaml parsing. This was fundamentally not

When the keystone user provider does it's prefetch for
the user list, it is not passing the --domain parameter
in the call. This results in the cli receiving a 401
error and puts the openstack provider in an error state
that causes all other providers dependent on the openstack
provider to error out.

This change adds the the --domain parameter with the default
domain as the value.

When the live migration, currently we would check whether the
destination host has enough memory, but would not check whether the
destination host has enough vcpus.

This may lead to excessive VMs are migrated to a host, at the same time
it leads to performance degradation of a VM in that host(such as io/vnc).

The VMUtils class init method ignores the host attribute, not
passing it to its super class.

For this reason, a local connection will be estabilished even if a
remote host is requested. This breaks live migration when having

This patch fixes this issue.

Importing openstack_dashboard from within tests/__init__.py causes
problems under Django 1.9 because some changes to module loading mean
that Django gets upset that it hasn't finished loading its application.

Moving the import and BaseRecordFormCleanTests to tests/base.py resolves
the issue.

In addition, tests/settings.py is modified to use logging.NullHandler

Written and tested using Linux version of ZFS. Requirements ------------ - NFS daemon that can be handled via 'exportfs' app. - ZFS filesystem packages, either Kernel or FUSE versions. - ZFS zpools that are going to be used by Manila should exist and be configured as desired. Manila will not change zpool configuration. - For remote ZFS hosts according to manila-share service host SSH should be installed. - For ZFS hosts that support replication: - SSH access for each other should be passwordless. - Service IP addresses should be available by ZFS hosts for each other. Supported Operations -------------------- The following operations are supported: - Create NFS Share - Delete NFS Share - Allow NFS Share access - Only IP access type is supported for NFS - Both access levels are supported - 'RW' and 'RO' - Deny NFS Share access - Create snapshot - Delete snapshot - Create share from snapshot - Extend share - Shrink share - Replication (experimental): - Create/update/delete/promote replica operations are supported Possibilities ------------- - Any amount of ZFS zpools can be used by share driver. - Allowed to configure default options for ZFS datasets that are used for share creation. - Any amount of nested datasets is allowed to be used. - All share replicas are read-only, only active one is RW. - All share replicas are synchronized periodically, not continuously. So, status 'in_sync' means latest sync was successful. Time range between syncs equals to value of config global opt 'replica_state_update_interval'. - Driver is able to use qualified extra spec 'zfsonlinux:compression'. It can contain any value that is supported by used ZFS app. But if it is disabled via config option with value 'compression=off', then it will not be used. Restrictions ------------ The ZFSonLinux share driver has the following restrictions: - Only IP access type is supported for NFS. - Only FLAT network is supported. - 'Promote share replica' operation will switch roles of current 'secondary' replica and 'active'. It does not make more than one active replica available. - 'Manage share' operation is not yet implemented. - 'SaMBa' based sharing is not yet implemented. - 'Thick provisioning' is not yet implemented. Known problems -------------- - 'Promote share replica' operation will make ZFS filesystem that became secondary as RO only on NFS level. On ZFS level system will stay mounted as was - RW. Backend Configuration --------------------- The following parameters need to be configured in the manila configuration file for the ZFSonLinux driver: - share_driver = manila.share.drivers.zfsonlinux.driver.ZFSonLinuxShareDriver - driver_handles_share_servers = False - replication_domain = custom_str_value_as_domain_name - If empty, then replication will be disabled - If set then will be able to be used as replication peer for other backends with same value. - zfs_share_export_ip = <user_facing IP address of ZFS host> - zfs_service_ip = <IP address of service network interface of ZFS host> - zfs_zpool_list = zpoolname1,zpoolname2/nested_dataset_for_zpool2 - Can be one or more zpools - Can contain nested datasets - zfs_dataset_creation_options = <list of ZFS dataset options> - readonly,quota,sharenfs and sharesmb options will be ignored - zfs_dataset_name_prefix = <prefix> - Prefix to be used in each dataset name. - zfs_dataset_snapshot_name_prefix = <prefix> - Prefix to be used in each dataset snapshot name. - zfs_use_ssh = <boolean_value> - Set 'False' if ZFS located on the same host as `manila-share` service - Set 'True' if `manila-share` service should use SSH for ZFS configuration - zfs_ssh_username = <ssh_username> - Required for replication operations - Required for SSH'ing to ZFS host if 'zfs_use_ssh' is set to 'True' - zfs_ssh_user_password = <ssh_user_password> - Password for 'zfs_ssh_username' of ZFS host. - Used only if 'zfs_use_ssh' is set to 'True' - zfs_ssh_private_key_path = <path_to_private_ssh_key> - Used only if 'zfs_use_ssh' is set to 'True' - zfs_share_helpers = NFS=manila.share.drivers.zfsonlinux.utils.NFSviaZFSHelper - Approach for setting up helpers is similar to various other share driver - At least one helper should be used. - zfs_replica_snapshot_prefix = <prefix> - Prefix to be used in dataset snapshot names that are created by 'update replica' operation.

We'd like to let the post puppet pacemaker controller services
restart to happen for the convergence step so set the
UpdateIdentifier. However also set the PackageUpdate to noop so the
yum_update.sh doesn't happen.

Since a full haproxy restart is expected, we no longer need the
systemctl reload added at Iae3bad745ecdf952a7a0314fe1375d07eb47c454

The default root device logic is different between IPA and the old ramdisk.
It results in user frustration when a mere rebuild moves their root device.
Actually, without cleaning it will lead to breakages, as cloud-init can't
reliably handle two config drive partitions and will use a random one.

This change makes IPA respect the ""disk"" argument which we still send.
Note that it only affects iSCSI drivers.

Currently, neutron core resources (like net, subnet, port and subnetpool)
do not save time-stamps upon their creation and updation. This
information can be critical for debugging purposes.

This patch introduces a new extension called ""timestamp"" extending existing
the neutron core resources to allow their creation and modification times
to be record. Now this patch add this resource schema and the functions which
listen db events to add timestamp fields.

DocImpact: Neutron core resources now contain 'timestamp' fields like
           'created_at' and 'updated_at'

In bind() method of dhcp_agent_scheduler for transaction was not
used context manager. This is not correct as if another exception
appear, not DBDuplicateEntry, that is caught, current transaction
will hang.

Tempest change 9bee3b92f1559cb604c8bd74dcca57805a85a97a
renamed a test in our blacklist so update the filter to
handle the old and new name.

The Tempest team is hesitant to revert the change so we
should handle it ourselves and eventually move to using
test uuids for our blacklist, but there might need to
be work in devstack-gate for that first.

WebOb change https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/230 changed
the way in which the error response body is formatted such that
it's no longer a nested dict. So we have to handle both the
old convention of an error message key to the response body error
dict and the new way with just the error body dict.

This was reported upstream:
https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/235

But given this was apparently implemented as a long-overdue change
in WebOb the behavior is not likely to change.

Cooldown behavior changed in commit:
50cc71e33c40a9e3be604b16f77d3c3cf030a63b

Restore the cooldown behavior so that when a group does not encounter
scaling activity, a cooldown period is not activated.

Inthis case, the libvirt driver might try to find large pages, but fallback to small pages, but other drivers may choose alternate policies for ""any"" - pagesize: (string) An explicit page size can be set if the workload has specific requirements. This value can be an integer value for the page size in kB, or can use any standard suffix. e.g. 4kB, 2MB, 2048, 1GB. .. note:: Large pages can be enabled for guest RAM without any regard to whether the guest OS will use them or not. ie if the guest OS chooses not to use huge pages, it will merely see small pages as before. Conversely though, if a guest OS does intend to use huge pages, it is very important that the guest RAM be backed by huge pages otherwise the guest OS will not be getting the performance benefit it is expecting.

We need to start populating the mappings of instance to cells. For now a
mapping with a null cell_mapping will indicate that the instance has not
yet been scheduled and that list/show requests should be honored using
the persisted RequestSpec/BuildRequest. That work will be a followup to
this one.

There's no need to leave instance_mappings loitering in the database if
there are no cells yet. So if a scheduled host does not belong to a cell
the instance_mapping will be removed. The instance will be mapped later
as part of the migration process to cellsv2.

`patch_cover` checks to make sure your patch has
adequate test coverage.

How it works is it stashes your changes, runs `tox -e cover`,
saves the results then stash pops your change and runs cover
again.  It then reports to show if your code in your patch
has 100% test coverage or not.

The intent of this job is to be a non-voting / warning like
job that can inform reviewers if the review clearly needs
more testing.

Since cover.sh is copied from [0] the copyright should
reflect the owners of the code.

vhost-user is a userspace protocol to establish connectivity
between a virto-net frontend typically qemu and a
userspace virtio backend such as ovs with dpdk.

vhost-user interfaces exist only in userspace from the host perspective
and are not represented in the linux networking stack as kernel netdevs.
As a result attempting to set the mtu on a vhost-user interface
using ifconfig or ip link will fail with a device not found error.

- this change removes a call to _set_device_mtu when plugging
  vhost-user interfaces.
- this change prevents the device not found error from occurring
  which stopped vms booting with vhost-user interfaces
  due to an uncaught exception resulting in a failure to set the
  interface type in ovs.
- this change make creating vhost-user interface
  an atomic action.

This latent bug is only triggered when the mtu value is set to a
value other than 0 which was the default proir to mitaka.

Prerequisits ~~~~~~~~~~~~ The following packages must be installed on the same host with manila-share service: - NFS server - Samba server >= 3.2.0 - LVM2 >= 2.02.66 Services must be up and running, ports used by the services must not be blocked. A node with manila-share service should be accessible to share service users. LVM should be preconfigured. By default LVM driver expects to find a volume group named ``lvm-shares``. This volume group will be used by the driver for share provisioning. It should be managed by node administrator separately. Shared File Systems service driver configuration setting ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ To use the driver a corresponding backend should be set up. A driver must be explicitly specified as well as export IP address. An absolutely minimal set that will enable LVM share driver could be found below: .. code-block:: ini [LVM_sample_backend] share_driver = manila.share.drivers.lvm.LVMShareDriver lvm_share_export_ip = 1.2.3.4 ``lvm_share_export_ip`` here is the address to be used by clients for accessing shares. In the simpliest use case it should be the same as host's address. Supported shared filesystems and operations ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The driver supports CIFS and NFS shares. The following operations are supported: - Create a share. - Delete a share. - Allow share access. Note the following limitations: - Only IP access type is supported for NFS. - Deny share access. - Create a snapshot. - Delete a snapshot. - Create a share from a snapshot. - Extend a share. Known restrictions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - LVM driver is not supposed to be used together with Neutron, simultaneous usage might cause issues with share deletion (shares won't get deleted from volume group). Driver options ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The following table contains the configuration options specific to this driver. .. include:: ../../tables/manila-lvm.rst ",,87,0

When dvr serviceable port is deleted/migrated, dvr callback checks
if there are any more dvr serviceable ports on the host and if
there are no - removes the router from the agent on that host.
To prevent snat namespace removal we need to check SNAT bindings
and not remove router from l3 agent hosting SNAT.

was removed because this change renders it invalid.

Each project, in turn, is composed of multiple services. To process some request, e.g. to boot a virtual machine, OpenStack uses multiple services from different projects. In the case something works too slowly, it's extremely complicated to understand what exactly goes wrong and to locate the bottleneck. To resolve this issue, we introduce a tiny but powerful library, **osprofiler**, that is going to be used by all OpenStack projects and their python clients. To be able to generate 1 trace per request, that goes through all involved services, and builds a tree of calls. Why not cProfile and etc? ------------------------- **The scope of this library is quite different:** * We are interested in getting one trace of points from different service, not tracing all python calls inside one process. * This library should be easy integratable in OpenStack. This means that: * It shouldn't require too many changes in code bases of integrating projects. * We should be able to turn it off fully. * We should be able to keep it turned on in lazy mode in production (e.g. admin should be able to ""trace"" on request).

I97f0cf78bf2c980628abe0f18aa9f5e96af70ae7 stopped the bot from
proposing generated updates to the constraints file. Before that,
two bot proposed updates were landed in stable/liberty which made
upper-constraints diverge from what was released with the liberty GA
and are causing some problems with packages being able to install
together from minimum liberty versions and upper-constraints using
versions that come from mitaka.

This change specifically resets the oslo.config version (and
dependencies, but not transitive dependencies) in upper-constraints to
that of the liberty GA (based on commit
1cc88e0d007acb49d4fa2f7633ed1302b6d2bd4a which was the last commit
before the bot proposed updates were merged).

This should resolve an issue where the oslo.config job
gate-tempest-dsvm-neutron-src-oslo.config fails on stable/liberty
because it's installing oslo.config from source which results in
version 2.4.1.dev3.

7627e1bae53747e1471caf632dfc1b6edf2e26cf introduced new code to add the
environment to the files mapping, so server side resolution of multiple
environments is possible.

However, the environment added is wrong when you're handling those with
relative paths inside, we must add the resolved version or the keys
don't map to keys in the files map, an you get an error when we try
to locate the file on the server.

Evidently we lack adequate functional test coverage of this, which can
be addressed via a heat patch, but I added a unit test illustrating
the problem.

When using Neutron, L3 agent, and OpenVSwitch, the IP address is moved
from the physical interface, ethX, over to the OVS bridge, br-ex. This
is done by ./stack.sh during the neutron L3 configuration.  This
movement is required in order to maintain connectivity to this IP
address.

When the host machine is rebooted OR the network service is restarted,
the IP address is associated with the physical interface, ethX, once
again and the IP address is no longer reachable.

Update rejoin-stack.sh to move the IP address (if necessary) using
the same logic that is invoked during stack.sh

Currently neutron DCHP scheduler assumes that that every server running
a dhcp-agent can reach every network. Typically the scheduler can
wrongly schedule a vlan network on a dhcp-agent that has no reachability
to the network it's supposed to serve (ex: network's physical_network
not supported).

Typically such usecase can append if:

* physical_networks are dedicated to a specific service and we don't
  want to mix dnsmasqs related to different services (for
  isolation/configuration purpose),
* physical_networks are dedicated to a specific rack (see example
  diagram http://i.imgur.com/NTBxRxk.png), the rack interconnection can
  be handled outside of neutron or inside when routed-networks will be
  supported.

This change makes the DHCP scheduler network reachability aware by
querying plugin's filter_hosts_with_network_access method.

This change provides an implementation for ML2 plugin delegating host
filtering to its mechanism drivers: it aggregates the filtering done by
each mechanism or disables filtering if any mechanism doesn't overload
default mechanism implementation[1] (for backward compatibility with
out-of-tree mechanisms). Every in-tree mechanism overloads the default
implementation: OVS/LB/SRIOV mechanisms use their agent mapping to filter
hosts, l2pop/test/logger ones return empty set (they provide to ""L2
capability"").

This change provides a default implementation[2] for other plugins
filtering nothing (for backward compatibility), they can overload it to
provide their own implementation.

Such host filtering has some limitations if a dhcp-agent is on a host
handled by multiple l2 mechanisms with one mechanism claiming network
reachability but not the one handling dhcp-agent ports. Indeed the
host is able to reach the network but not dhcp-agent ports! Such
limitation will be handled in a follow-up change using host+vif_type
filtering.

To achieve rolling upgrades we need to make non-backward-compatible DB schema
migrations in a very specific manner that spans through 3 releases. In
particular we need to be very careful when dropping or altering columns
and tables.

This commit adds a test that blocks all the ALTER and DROP operations
from DB migrations. It allows to specify exceptions from this rule for two
purposes:
* Some DROP/ALTER migrations aren't subtractive (e.g. dropping a
  constraint).
* When following the process we've designed for non-backward-compatible
  migrations, we should be able to drop first unused columns or tables
  in O release.

The test is based on similar one implemented in Nova.

Drivers that do not need the bridge parameter are safe to ignore it.
Actually, the base abstract interface for those drivers does not allow
to pass the new parameter.

Ideally, the base class __init__ signature would change to accept the
argument, but we can't do it without breaking API.

So instead, just handle both types of drivers - those that accept the
additional argument, and those that don't. And don't assume the latter
are somehow wrong.

Some standalone plugins, such as networking-ovn, are expecting
to store provider network information in neutron database, but
we have no table, like other extensions do, for provider
network extension defined.

This patch moves NetworkSegment table out of the ML2 code tree.
The API methods to operate segments are also moved, but stub
methods are still kept in the ml2 db API.

This is unsafe when calling ML2 because ML2 assumes that its
functions will not be called inside of a transaction. This is
not only an issue for drivers that try to do DB lookups using
a different session in the post commit operation, but it's a
big issue for the delete methods.

The delete subnet and network methods in ML2 have 'while True'
loops that catch concurrency errors and retry the operation after
looking up info. If these are called inside a transaction, the
lookups will contain stale information and it can lead to the
while True loop never terminating!

This patch adds a libvirt hook that saves the VM console log everytime
it shutdown. This is great for troubleshooting because it allow us to
see what happened with the VM on every boot instead of only the last one.

Devstack: Remove QEMU hook at ./unstack
Remove the libvirt QEMU hook to rotate the logs when ./unstack is
invoked. Otherwise it will always rotate the logs even if the
IRONIC_VM_LOG_ROTATE is set to False in a subsequently ran.

This commit also makes the path to the hook configurable.

Devstack: Make sure libvirt's hooks directory exists
Before copying the QEMU hook to the libvirt's hooks directory, make sure
that the path exists. Some distros do not create it by default (e.g
Fedora 23).
