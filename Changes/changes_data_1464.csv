Threads are the recommended way to scale CPU performance since HAProxy
1.8.

Official documentation says: « While ""nbproc"" historically used to be the only
way to use multiple processors, it also involved a number of shortcomings
related to the lack of synchronization between processes (health-checks, peers,
stick-tables, stats, ...) which do not affect threads. As such, any modern
configuration is strongly encouraged to migrate away from ""nbproc"" to
""nbthread"". ».

While more recent versions of HAProxy automatically detect the number of
available CPU and enable threads for them, it can be useful to explicitely set
the value.

In this patch, setting cpu-map for threads is not supported.

OSA playbooks only call this role once for all Ironic containers
(API and inspector). As a result, the wheel builds only happen
once. If the first host (which is responsible for wheel builds)
is an API container, these vars would prevent Ironic inspector
requirements being accounted for, and as such no matching

When the venv is deployed to the Ironic inspector container,
the lack of constraints can cause dependencies which are too new
to be installed, causing the service to fail.

Alternatively this role could be called twice by the playbook
for differing container/host roles, but as inspector is expected

The current implementation of the resolve_domain function doesn't
support a multivalue list of groups in the received claim. This
patch aims to fix it in a way that mainteins the current behavior
for non-multivalued groups.

The current mapping engine expects each group on a separate
object:

group: [{name:group1},{name:group2}]

Meanwhile the IdP sends a multivalue array of groups, the length
of which may vary depending of the user. Then the mapping engine
transform it to a string representation of an array.

IdP sends:
	[g1;g2;g3]

After mapping engine:
	""['g1','g2','g3']""

After apply the mapping rules, on the resolve_domain function:
	group: [{name:""[g1,g2,g3]""}]

Which raise an error ""Group has no entry on the backend"".

This change modifies the os-vif ovs plugin to set a default
tc qdisc on ovs interface when the host os is not windows
and the system datapath is used.

This change fixes a ""silent"" bug in the functional test code due
to a change in an ovsdbapp function signiture to accpet a new paramater.

This reverts commit ee4d51197f175d03a4edd2c9af2188f5df2d8aa2.

It later turned out that setenv does not override os.environ in wsgi
applications and this option can't be used to customize the environment
variable as intended. Let's revert the change to keep the interface

When multipath is enabled and friendly names are ON and we try
to extend a volume, we pass the SCSI WWID to the multipath_resize_map
method which is not correct.

There are 2 things we can pass to the multipathd resize map command:

1) Multipath device (eg: dm-0)
2) Alias (eg: mpath1) or UUID (eg: 36005076303ffc56200000000000010aa)

The value should be an alias (mpath1) when friendly names are ON
and UUID (36005076303ffc56200000000000010aa) when friendly names
are OFF. However, we only pass the UUID irrespective of the value
set for friendly names.

This patch passes the multipath device path (to multipathd resize
map command) which is the real path of the multipath device (/dev/dm-*).
This fixes the issue as it passes the same value irrespective of if
the friendly names are ON or OFF.

For some unknown reason, Horizon's Apache configuration enables
requiring of client certificate when tls-everywhere is enabled, but
since haproxy is not configured to use a client certificate, it all
breaks horribly.

From what I can say looking at the history of commits, the
SSLVerifyClient parameter was included in tripleo-templates from
the beginning, but with an invalid value of ""true"", so it had
no effect and everything worked fine. At some point the value
was fixed to correct ""require"", but looks like that was never
tested, either by the author or by the reviewers, and ever since
then Horizon is broken when tls-everywhere is enabled.

We have two ways of fixing this. Either remove the ssl_verify_client
like this patch is doing, or add the client certificates to the
haproxy configuration. Since no other service is using client
certificates like that, I choose to go with an option that brings
Horizon to the same setup as other services.

PEP 333 (WSGI) says: ""If the iterable returned by the application has
a close() method, the server or gateway must call that method upon
completion of the current request[.]""

There's a bunch of places where we weren't doing that; some of them
matter more than others. Calling .close() can prevent a connection
leak in some cases. In others, it just provides a certain pedantic
smugness. Either way, we should do what WSGI requires.

Noteworthy goofs include:

  * If a client is downloading a large object and disconnects halfway
    through, a proxy -> obj connection may be leaked. In this case,
    the WSGI iterable is a SegmentedIterable, which lacked a close()
    method. Thus, when the WSGI server noticed the client disconnect,
    it had no way of telling the SegmentedIterable about it, and so
    the underlying iterable for the segment's data didn't get
    closed.

    Here, it seems likely (though unproven) that the object server
    would time out and kill the connection, or that a
    ChunkWriteTimeout would fire down in the proxy server, so the
    leaked connection would eventually go away. However, a flurry of
    client disconnects could leave a big pile of useless connections.

  * If a conditional request receives a 304 or 412, the underlying
    app_iter is not closed. This mostly affects conditional requests
    for large objects.

The leaked connections were noticed by this patch's co-author, who
made the changes to SegmentedIterable. Those changes helped, but did
not completely fix, the issue. The rest of the patch is an attempt to
plug the rest of the holes.

bcrypt  hashing algorythm has a limitation on length of passwords it
can hash on 72 bytes. In [1] a password trimm to 54 symbols has been
implemented, which resulted in password being invalidated after the
keystone upgrade, since passwords are trimmed differently by bcrypt
itself, as well as len(str()) is not always equal to
len(str().encode()) as trimming should be done based on bytes and not
string itself.

With the change we return a byte object from
`verify_length_and_trunc_password`, so it does not need to
be encoded afterwards, since we need to strip based on bytes
rather then on length of the string.

This reverts commit 1694f0ce20dcea536bf1656b3a19e61aa2100fbf.

Reason for revert:
It later turned out that setenv does not override os.environ in wsgi
applications and this option can't be used to customize the environment
variable as intended. Let's revert the change to keep the interface
as much simple as possible instead of keeping the useless option.

Glance v1 APIs were removed in Rocky and tempest master
does not support the Rocky release. If glance v1 APIs
needs to be tested for older release then older Tempest
can be used.

This removes the Glance v1 APIs tests, config option,
and its service clients.

Now that older branches for networking-bagpipe transitioned to End of
Life and legacy zuul jobs are not needed anymore, it turned out that
one of the jobs is still used in stable/train as experimental,
non-voting job (legacy-networking-bagpipe-dsvm-fullstack).
Since this is the last place where the job is defined and the fact it
was not used since a year [1], did not run successfully since 4.5 years
ago [2], I think it's safe to remove it.

Trying to deploy OpenStack environment consisting of ironic nova
hypervisor & hardware Ironic node (not VM Ironic node) with devstack

Devstack error says error occurred while calling configure_libvirt
in configure_nova_hypervisor. This happens because libvirt related
packages are not installed when specifying ""VIRT_DRIVER=ironic""

To fix this problem, this commit add ""if"" statement to check

repositories in this patch (for example in openstack-zuul-jobs, etc.)
and won't be used anymore if stable/rocky is deleted. Propose a job
removal patch for them.

Please +1 if the team is ready for us to proceed with this transition,
or -1 if there are still some activity on the branch and the team wants
to continue to maintain it.

The get_* methods on the Flavor object use a common helper method to
build a query object to execute later.

Currently, the @api_db_api.context_manager.reader decorator which
manages the session is located on the helper method instead of on the
methods that actually execute the database queries. Part of the context
manager's job is to close the session after the query is executed.
Because the decorator is not on the methods that actually execute the
queries, those database connections are not being closed and it will
eventually lead to errors like:

  sqlalchemy.exc.TimeoutError: QueuePool limit of size 5 overflow 50
  reached, connection timed out, timeout 30.00 (Background on this
  error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/14/3o7r)

which means the connection pool size plus the overflow size has been
reached and the pool will block for a fixed period of time before
timing out and raising this error.

This removes the @api_db_api.context_manager.reader decorator from the
query build helper method and adds it to the Flavor.get_* methods that
execute the database queries.

A recent oslo.messaging patch [1], not yet merged, who aim to update the
test runtime for antelope lead us to the following error:

```
qdrouterd: Python: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qpid_dispatch'
```

Neither debian nor ubuntu in the latest releases have any binary
built for the qpid backend, not even 3rd party. Only qpid proton,
the client lib, is available.

To solve this issue, these changes propose to deprecate the AMQP1 driver
who is the one based on qpid and proton, and propose to remove the
related functional tests.

The AMQP1 driver doesn't seems to be widely used.

Prior to this patch the ovn-db-sync script did not check if the router
ports were actually out-of-sync before marking them to be updated. This
behavior introduced irrelevant information in the sync report (specially
when ran in ""log"" mode) making the user think that the databases were
out-of-sync even when they were not.

This patch adds the code checking for differences in the Neutron Router
Ports and OVN Logical Router Port entries prior to updating them.

This patch could/should probably be split in two, one for syncing
and one for building.

Building:
  We check all the hosts in the ansible_play_batch for distro/arch
exactly the same as venv_build_targets, and then we flatten that
structure to a list of venv_build_requesters. The
python_venv_wheel_build was set to run_once, because we only needed
it to build once for the single distro/arch, but now we can pick
out one host for every distro/arch and have it request a build to
it's corresponding repo_container/distro/arch via venv_build_host.

Synchronizing:
  If packages are built on repo_all[0] we just move them into
venv_build_host_wheel_path, and if on any other host, we rsync the
files over to repo_all[0] for further distribution. (Shamelessly
ripped from the old repo_build.)

My suggestion would be two patches,
1) sync
2) building with a depends on sync

Thoughts?

When we deploy both DistributedComputeHCIScaleOut and
DistributedComputeHCI, Ceph Mon and Mgr are wrongly deployed on
DistributedComputeHCIScaleOut nodes.
This bug comes from the wrong regex to find out DistributedComputeHCI
nodes, like:

  wrong regex: .*-distributedcomputehci

This wrong regex matches both DistributedComputeHCIScaleOut and
DistributedComputeHCI, because their default HostHostnameFormat are:

  DistributedComputeHCI: %stackname%-distributedcomputehci-%index%
  DistributedComputeHCIScaleOut: %stackname%-distributedcomputehciscaleout-%index%

By this change, the regex will be:

  new regex: .*-distributedcomputehci-\d+$

Such a release will support upgrades from either the immediate previous release (that is, following the traditional OpenStack upgrade process) or from the previous SLURP release. (See the `Release Cadence Adjustment <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/resolutions/20220210-release-cadence-adjustment.html>`_ resolution for details.) An implication of supporting both the SLURP and the traditional release process is that operators upgrading from one SLURP to the next SLURP will not see the release notes from the release in between the SLURPs. At the same time, operators who follow the traditional release upgrade process should not have to read these intermediate release notes twice. (This is because if people are forced to re-read a bunch of stuff, it is more likely that their eyes will glaze over and they'll miss something new and important.) Thus, we need to make the intermediate release notes easily discoverable from the SLURP release notes, both so that they don't clutter up the SLURP notes and so that they are easily available for operators who haven't already read them. Discovery will be enhanced if all projects follow the same basic structure for doing this, which is outlined below. Let's pretend that Wallaby was a SLURP release, Xena was the next non-SLURP release, and Yoga was a SLURP release. Deployers following the SLURP strategy will upgrade directly from Wallaby to Yoga, skipping Xena. Further, suppose that Yoga has not been released yet, and you are finalizing the Yoga (second SLURP) release notes now. #. Generate a static page of the Xena (Yoga SLURP minus 1) release notes. * from the root directory of the project repo: :: $ tox -e releasenotes --notest $ .tox/releasenotes/bin/reno report \ --title ""Xena Release Notes"" \ --branch ""stable/xena"" | \ sed 's/^ *$//g' > ""releasenotes/source/xena-static.rst"" * a few points to note: * The title heading in the ""regular"" release notes is always ""X Series Release Notes"". Note that we're using something different, namely, ""X Release Notes"". This is because reno uses the title when generating anchors in the ``.rst`` file, and we need the anchors in the static document to be unique. * Make sure that you include ""-static"" in the filename being written to. There will already be a ``xena.rst`` file in the directory and we don't want to overwrite it. (That file is used for the ""regular"" release notes for the series, which will continue to be generated in the normal way as patches are backported following the normal backport process.) * Why use this extra static ``.rst`` file? For two reasons: * Any release notes associated with changes since the coordinated release (that is, the x.0.0 release) are already included in the SLURP release's notes, because the OpenStack backport process dictates that changes must be merged to release *n*\+1 before they can be merged to release *n*. We don't want these to be duplicated. * Having a static ``.rst`` file available will allow you to include anchors in the static file so that your SLURP release notes can link to specific items in the static page. #. Edit the static release notes page. * Using cinder as an example, the original Xena release was version 19.0.0, and Xena 19.1.0 has been released, and some other fixes have been merged into the stable/xena branch. We want the static file to contain *only* the release notes for 19.0.0. So if you hadn't thought ahead and generated the static page at the time of the 19.0.0 release, you'll have to remove the extraneous stuff by hand. Joking aside, there's a good reason to wait until the last minute to generate the static file because, given the way reno works, corrections to release notes in stable branches must be made directly to the stable branch, and if you had actually generated the static file early, you'd miss any corrections. When you're done, the top of the static ``.rst`` file should look like this: :: ================== Xena Release Notes ================== .. _Xena Release Notes_19.0.0_stable_xena: 19.0.0 ====== .. _Xena Release Notes_19.0.0_stable_xena_Prelude: Prelude ------- .. releasenotes/notes/xena-release-prelude-2190d8c515dbedc1.yaml @ b'0700979bb8fddc79d80c325efd4f352fde955b44' Welcome to the Xena release of the OpenStack Block Storage service (cinder) ... * One more change needs to be made to the static ``.rst`` file. We aren't going to include it in the toctree; instead we'll link to it from the SLURP release notes. So we need to add an ``:orphan:`` directive at the top of the page so that sphinx doesn't generate a warning (which the openstack releasenotes job treats as an error, thereby failing your releasenotes build). It should be the first non-comment non-whitespace characters in the file: :: :orphan: ================== Xena Release Notes ================== etc. * Don't forget to do a 'git add' to the static file, because you will need to commit it to the repository. #. Add a link to the static page from the SLURP release notes. * The final task is to add a point to the ""Prelude"" section of the SLURP release that contains a link to the static page. You do this in a regular reno ``.yaml`` file. For example, :: --- prelude: | Welcome to the Yoga release of the OpenStack Block Storage service (cinder) ... * Something important about this release. * Another important thing to mention. * **This is a SLURP release.** If you are upgrading directly from the previous SLURP release (Wallaby), we recommend that you read through the :doc:`release notes from the intermediate release <xena-static>` (Xena). There may be items of such importance from an intermediate non-SLURP release that a project team may wish to reemphasize them in the SLURP release notes. That's perfectly OK. We just ask that you do this judiciously so that deployers don't think that they can completely ignore the other notes from the intermediate release (which must be important, or why did you write them in the first place?). Since the intermediate non-SLURP release notes are being kept in a static ``.rst`` document, you don't have to repeat entire notes. Instead, you can add an anchor to the particular item you want to highlight, and then link to it from the SLURP release notes. Finally, as of this writing, we haven't actually had a SLURP release yet. So we fully expect the release note process to evolve as both project teams and deployers adapt to it. But hopefully this simple approach is a good start. ",,174,0

Major:
- Result's first() does not raise NoResultFound, it returns None.
- Avoid opening a read transaction while a write transaction is active.

Minor:
- Do not handle NoResultFound where it cannot happen (or is already
  handled).
- Only load the fields we use when fetching intermediate results.
- Do not load the node the 2nd time when releasing: the detection of
  the exact error is racy anyway.

In this PR https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/openstack-helm-images/+/887596
while debugging we removed the zuul.d/openstack-loci.yaml file
as a job dependency. This prevented upload and promote jobs
to be launched.

Also recently we switched to multinode compute-kit jobs
for some Openstack releases where we deploy Kubernetes
using Kubeadm with Containerd as a container runtime.

These multinode compute-kit jobs are not fully compatible with
the role use-buildset-registry which is used to configure
image registry to test new images.

There are two issues:
- use-buildset-registry role expects root user has a valid kube
  config file
- use-buildset-registry configures docker to use private zuul
  registry, but for multinode compute-kit environment we need
  to configure containerd instead

So, for now we redefine the openstack-helm-images-compute-kit-zed-ubuntu_focal
job, so it uses single node compute-kit env.

When creating a backup and it fails we will try
to update the status on the volume but if it does
not exist we will instead fail on that and the
backup will be stuck in creating status which means
cloud admin need to help resetting the status.

This catches the VolumeNotFound exception and ignores
updating the volume status and thus backup will be
set to error and can be deleted by user instead.

Some identity api tests are failing, when keystone parameter
minimum_password_age is set to value greater than 0. It causes inability
to update user's password more than once per test suite. As in this test
suite it is required total of four times, this patch suggests skipping

This patch provides the support for share server migrations between
hosts on different physical networks. Share server's network may
therefore have different segmentation id's for source and target hosts.
It is achieved by creating an inactive port binding on the target host
during share server migration, and then cut it over to target host when
migration completes. The implementation is driver agnostic, so that this
feature should be not limited to specific driver, although it is only
tested against NetApp driver. The feature is enabled by a new share
service option 'server_migration_extend_neutron_network'. Note
supporting for multiple bindings of Manila ports must be enabled in
neutron ML2 plugin.

Rebuild tests rebuild the class level server which
is used by other tests also and they rebuild it
again on the original image. If anything goes
wrong with the class level server then we do recreate
the server in setup of each test.

Doing so much things on server needed by other tests
and recreate them in setup is too much. Instead of
rebuilding the class level server, let's create its
own server and perform the rebuild.

Also, this test does two ssh validation after rebuild
so removing the one.

While looking at an unrelated issue I noticed log lines like
this in the neutron-ovn-metadata-agent log file:

  No port found in network b62452f3-ec93-4cd7-af2d-9f9eabb33b12
  with IP address 10.246.166.21,10.131.84.23

While it might seem harmless, looking at the code it only showed
a single value being logged:

  LOG.error(""No port found in network %s with IP address %s"",
  network_id, remote_address)

The code in question is looking for a matching IP address, but
will never match the concatenated string.

Google shows the additional IP address(es) that might be present
in this header are actually proxies:

  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For

And sure enough in my case the second IP was always the same.

The code needs to be changed to account for proxies, which are not
actually necessary to lookup what port is making the request.

This change includes back the the helm-toolkit snippet:
kubernetes_pod_rbac_serviceaccount to the openvswitch Daemonset
definition, since it is responsible for creating the POD's
ServiceAccount which contains imagePullSecrets that enable the POD to
retrieve images from private registries.

Originally openvswitch chart had two daemonset definitions: for the
db and for the server, but recently both were merged into a single
daemonset [1] and the template inclusion was dropped during this merge

The 'all-plugin' tox environment was deprecated by this patch [1].
Instead of the 'all-plugin' it is recommended to use the 'all' tox
environment.

This patch removes any reference to 'all-plugin' tox environment and
updates the documentation so that the installation steps work with
the 'all' venv.

bcrypt  hashing algorythm has a limitation on length of passwords it
can hash on 72 bytes. In [1] a password trimm to 54 symbols has been
implemented, which resulted in password being invalidated after the
keystone upgrade, since passwords are trimmed differently by bcrypt
itself, as well as len(str()) is not always equal to
len(str().encode()) as trimming should be done based on bytes and not
string itself.

With the change we return a byte object from
`verify_length_and_trunc_password`, so it does not need to
be encoded afterwards, since we need to strip based on bytes
rather then on length of the string.

Since we are python3 only for openstack we create a single python3
virtualenv to install all the packages into. This gives us the benefits
of installing into a virtualenv while still ensuring coinstallability.
This is a major change and will likely break many things.

There are several reasons for this. The change that started this effort
was pip stopped uninstalling packages which used distutils to generate
their package installation. Many distro packages do this which meant
that pip installed packages and distro packages could not coexist in the
global install space. More recently git has made pip installing repos as
root more difficult due to file ownership concerns.

Currently the switch to the global venv is optional, but if we go down
this path we should very quickly remove the old global installation
method as it has only caused us problems.

Major hurdles we have to get over are convincing rootwrap to trust
binaries in the virtualenvs (so you'll notice we update rootwrap
configs).

Some distros still have issues, keep them using the old setup for now.

During Antelope upgrade, haproxy-install.yml configures base service
listening on ports 80 and 443.
But at this point, horizon frontend is not removed yet so haproxy has
two frontends listening on 80/443.
During os-horizon-install.yml, horizon frontend is removed and
appropriate haproxy maps config is applied.

horizon will encounter intermittent issues.

upgrade when running haproxy-install.yml playbook.
To be precise: when horizon is already deployed in an environement but
its maps config is not there yet, haproxy will trigger reconfiguration
of horizon service.
This change is intendent to land only in 2023.1. Upgrades from 2023.1
to 2023.2 or 2024.1 are not affected.

See project-specific notes for relevant deadlines. .. _c-2: Caracal-2 milestone -------------------- January 11, 2024 is the Caracal-2 milestone. See project-specific notes for relevant deadlines. .. _c-mf: Membership Freeze ----------------- Projects must participate in at least two milestones in order to be considered part of the release. Projects made official after the second milestone, or which fail to produce milestone releases for at least one of the first and second milestones as well as the third milestone, are therefore not considered part of the release for the cycle. This does not apply to cycle-trailing packaging / lifecycle management projects. .. _c-extra-atcs: Extra-ATC freeze ---------------- All contributions to OpenStack are valuable, but some are not expressed as Gerrit code changes. That allow teams to list active contributors to their projects and who do not have a code contribution this cycle, and therefore won't automatically be considered an Active Technical Contributor and allowed to vote. This is done by adding extra-atcs to https://opendev.org/openstack/governance/src/branch/master/reference/projects.yaml before the Extra-ATC freeze date. .. _c-final-lib: Final release for non-client libraries -------------------------------------- Libraries that are not client libraries (Oslo and others) should issue their final release during this week. That allows to give time for last-minute changes before feature freeze. .. _c-3: Caracal-3 milestone -------------------- February 29, 2024 is the Caracal-3 milestone. See project-specific notes for relevant deadlines. .. _c-ff: Feature freeze -------------- The Caracal-3 milestone marks feature freeze for projects following the `release:cycle-with-rc`_ model. No featureful patch should be landed after this point. Exceptions may be granted by the project PTL. .. _release:cycle-with-rc: https://releases.openstack.org/reference/release_models.html#cycle-with-rc .. _c-final-clientlib: Final release for client libraries ---------------------------------- Client libraries should issue their final release during this week, to match feature freeze. .. _c-soft-sf: Soft StringFreeze ----------------- You are no longer allowed to accept proposed changes containing modifications in user-facing strings. Such changes should be rejected by the review team and postponed until the next series development opens (which should happen when RC1 is published). .. _c-rf: Requirements freeze ------------------- After the Caracal-3 milestone, only critical requirements and constraints changes will be allowed. Freezing our requirements list gives packagers downstream an opportunity to catch up and prepare packages for everything necessary for distributions of the upcoming release. The requirements remain frozen until the stable branches are created, with the release candidates. .. _c-rc1: RC1 target week --------------- The week of March 11, 2023 is the target date for projects following the `release:cycle-with-rc`_ model to issue their first release candidate. .. _c-hard-sf: Hard StringFreeze ----------------- This happens when the RC1 for the project is tagged. At this point, ideally no strings are changed (or added, or removed), to give translators time to finish up their efforts. .. _c-finalrc: Final RCs and intermediary releases ----------------------------------- The week of March 25, 2023 is the last week to issue release candidates or intermediary releases before release week. During release week, only final-release-critical releases will be accepted (at the discretion of the release team). .. _c-final: Caracal release ---------------- The Caracal coordinated release will happen on Wednesday, April 3, 2023. .. _c-cycle-highlights: Cycle Highlights ---------------- Cycle highlights need to be added to the release deliverables after the feature freeze to be included in any marketing release messaging. Highlights may be added after this point, but they will likely only be useful for historical purposes. See the `Project Team Guide`_ for more details and instructions on adding these highlights.

This patch implements a more resilient approach to handle the case
where Neutron API workers are killed and restarted. Instead of marking
all nodes for that host as offline, this patch tries to remove the
worker that was killed from the Hash Ring leaving all others nodes for
that host online.

In case the we fail to remove the node and another entry is added upon the
restart of the worker this patch also logs a clear critical log message to
alert the operator that there are more Hash Ring nodes than API workers
(it's expect to be the same) and that OVSDB events could go missing if
they are routed to the previous node that failed to be removed from the
ring.

In order to get a list of available ports, the current implementation
of the form code in `project/instances/attach_interface` loops through
the available networks in the project and requests a list of ports for
each via the Neutron API. This implementation is O(N) in time with a
large prefactor (the time for a Neutron API call) where N is the
number of networks.

Instead of calling the Neutron API for each network this change uses
one call to the Neutron API to get the list of ports on all networks
and filters this list via a list comprehension. While this
implementation is still O(N) the prefactor is significantly smaller.

Includes some unit test fixes to workaround the fact that patch
6ac31e0 is not backported beyond Y.

Currently logger is not properly initialized according to config
options or process arguments when the neutron-rpc-server script or
the api wsgi script is used. Because of this neutron does not generate
the log files as expected when we deploy api using WSGI and use
neutron-rpc-server, instead of the monolithic neutron-server.

This ensures the logger is initialized even when these two scripts
are used.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================================================== Support an external key manager for authentication credentials ============================================================== This specification describes the encryption and decryption methods for authentication credentials in Tacker by using an external key manager service such as OpenStack Key Manager (barbican) [#OpenStack_Key_Manager]_. Problem description =================== Tacker stores some authentication credentials in Tacker DB. However, in the case of the actual NFV operation of Tacker, these information should be encrypted for secure NFV management and security requirements to prevent eavesdropping and data exploitation by attackers. The following is a sample of VnfInstanceV2.vimConnectionInfo (Kubernetes): authentication credentials are password, bearer_token and client_secret. .. code-block:: { ""vim1"": { ""vimType"": ""ETSINFV.KUBERNETES.V_1"", ""accessInfo"": { ""username"": ""nfv_user"", ""password"": ""password"", ""bearer_token"": ""bearer_token"", ""client_secret"": ""client_secret"" }, ""interfaceInfo"": { ""endpoint"":""http://123.124.64.6:8443"", ""ssl_ca_cert"": ""ssl_ca_cert"" } } } This specification proposes an encryption and decryption implementations using a common key scheme using ""cryptography"" library and an external key management service to manage credentials and keys securely. Proposed change =============== The following changes will be proposed: #. Add utility functions to integrate with an external key manager. #. Add sample implementations with v2API and OpenStack Key Manager. #. Add configuration options. Add utility functions to integrate with an external key manager --------------------------------------------------------------- Since Tacker stores sensitive credentials in multiple DB tables, this specification will implement common utility functions to encrypt and decrypt the credentials in cooperation with an external key manager are required for both v1 and v2 API. Examples of authentication credentials to be encrypted ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The following is a list of examples of authentication credentials to be encrypted in Tacker. * accessInfo in VimConnectionInfo: password, bearer_token, and client_secret * paramsBasic and paramsOauth2ClientCredentials in authentication: password and clientPassword * metadata.targetsInfo.authInfo in Prometheus Plugin: ssh_password .. note:: This function will use generically for other sensitive information too. We will analysis and add more detailed target data if find new target, if new targets are found during our implementation. common utility functions include three main roles: 1. Manage encryption keys in cooperation with an external key manager. It enables the registration and deletion of encryption keys. 2. Encrypt the authentication credentials using the encryption key and store them to Tacker DB. 3. Decrypt the authentication credentials stored in Tacker DB by the decryption key and use them for VNF operations. Users can perform VNF operations without awareness of this process. On the other hand, the authentication credential is encrypted in tacker DB and the possibility of eavesdropping or data data exploitation is reduced. Two types of encryption keys are created: master key and table key. The table key is used to encrypt authentication information, and the master key is used to encrypt the table key. The table key is created when authentication information is saved in the DB, and the master key is created when Tacker is started. The table key and master key are stored in a new table created to store the encryption key. Add sample implementations with v2API and Barbican -------------------------------------------------- In this specification, it implements a sample usecase for encryption and decryption of authentication credentials to integrates with barbican [#OpenStack_Key_Manager]_ in v2 API. Example of proposed sequences in VNF LCM ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The following is an example of sequence for encryption and decryption of authentication credentials in VNF LCM operations under consideration. The following is a flow of Instantiation of a VNF instance with barbican under consideration. .. seqdiag:: seqdiag { Client; NFVO; tacker-server; tacker-conductor; VnfLcmDriver; TackerDB; Barbican; Client -> ""tacker-server"" [label = ""POST /vnflcm/v2/vnf_instances/{vnfInstanceId}/instantiate""]; Client <-- ""tacker-server"" [label = ""202 Accepted""]; ""tacker-server"" -> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""trigger asynchronous task""]; NFVO <- ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""POST /grants""]; NFVO --> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""201 Created""]; ""tacker-conductor"" -> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""encrypt auth credentials""]; ""tacker-conductor"" -> ""Barbican"" [label = ""register the encryption key""]; ""tacker-conductor"" <-- ""Barbican"" [label = ""200 Successful Request""]; ""tacker-conductor"" -> ""VnfLcmDriver"" [label = ""execute VnfLcmDriver""]; ""tacker-conductor"" <-- ""VnfLcmDriver"" [label = """"]; ""tacker-conductor"" -> ""TackerDB"" [label = ""store encrypted auth credentials""]; ""tacker-conductor"" <-- ""TackerDB"" [label = """"]; } The following is a flow of Termination of a VNF instance with barbican. .. seqdiag:: seqdiag { Client; NFVO; tacker-server; tacker-conductor; VnfLcmDriver; TackerDB; Barbican; Client -> ""tacker-server"" [label = ""POST /vnflcm/v2/vnf_instances/{vnfInstanceId}/terminate""]; Client <-- ""tacker-server"" [label = ""Response 202 Accepted""]; ""tacker-server"" -> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""trigger asynchronous task""]; NFVO <- ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""POST /grants""]; NFVO --> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""201 Created""]; ""tacker-conductor"" -> ""TackerDB"" [label = ""load encrypted auth credentials""]; ""tacker-conductor"" <-- ""TackerDB"" [label = """"]; ""tacker-conductor"" -> ""Barbican"" [label = ""get the encryption key""]; ""tacker-conductor"" <-- ""Barbican"" [label = ""200 Successful Request""]; ""tacker-conductor"" -> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""decrypt the encrypted auth credentials""]; ""tacker-conductor"" -> ""VnfLcmDriver"" [label = ""execute VnfLcmDriver""]; ""tacker-conductor"" <-- ""VnfLcmDriver"" [label = """"]; ""tacker-conductor"" -> ""Barbican"" [label = ""delete the encryption key""]; ""tacker-conductor"" <-- ""Barbican"" [label = ""204 No Content""]; } Add configuration options -------------------------- As the function defined in this specification changes the default sequences, it is suggested to add a configuration option to the ``tacker.conf`` file. Therefore, users can choose whether to enable this function or not. + Boolean value of ""use_credential_encryption"" This parameter determines whether using encryption. Default value: ""false"" + String value of ""keymanager_type"" This parameter determines the type of external key management service. Default value: ""barbican"" + String value of ""crypt_key_dir"". This parameter specifies the path where the encryption key is stored. Default value: """" .. note:: barbican will be supported in Tacker Bobcat cycle. If other external key management services will be supported in the future, this parameter allows the target service to be changed. As a suggested implementation, when the ``use_external_keymanager`` is True, the function of encryption and decryption of authentication credentials takes effect; When ``use_external_keymanager`` is False, this function will not performed. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- The key-related information (e.g., key type, key id) of the external key manager needs to be added in the data model. .. list-table:: :widths: 15 10 30 :header-rows: 1 * - Attribute name - Data type - Parameter description * - id - String - id of key information (primary key) * - secret_uuid - String - uuid of master key registered in barbican * - encrypted_key - String - table key for tacker * - key_type - String - how to retain master key. local or barbican * - in_use - Boolean - Flag of the latest key is used REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- If this change will be applied, the authentication credentials in Tacker DB will be encrypted with the encryption key, so encryption keys must be secured by an external key manager. The option to store encryption keys in the local is also allowed, but is deprecated in the production environment. In addition, encryption keys need to be backup so that users can decrypt the credentials in case of failure or disaster recovery. The following is an example of key backup when using barbican [#OpenStack_Key_Manager]_ as an external key manager. Key backup methods by Barbican ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The process for backup and restore of encryption keys will vary depending on the type of backend. Two separate components need to be backed up for simple crypto back end: the Key Encryption Key (KEK) and the database. * Backup and restore KEK. For the simple crypto back end, to backup the ``barbican.conf`` file that contains the master encryption key; KEK is written. This file must be backed up to a security hardened location. The actual data is stored in the Barbican database. To restore the key from a backup, it needs to copy the restored ``barbican.conf`` over the existing ``barbican.conf``. * Backup and restore the barbican database. Run the following steps while logged in to the ``controller-0`` node. 1. Retrieve barbican user password 2. Backup the barbican database 3. Database backup is stored in ``/home/heat-admin`` 4. Restore the databases .. note:: Only the user barbican has access to the barbican database. So the barbican user password is required to backup or restore the database. For more information, please refer to the OpenStack Key Manager backup documentation [#OpenStack_Key_Manager_Backup]_. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ Tacker needs to access an external key manager service for both encryption and decryption of authentication credentials. The performance impact might be ``LOW`` if there are few cases to use the encrypted authentication credentials that each time the Rest API is called. However, the impact might be ``HIGH`` if it needs access to an external key manager for every single data in the DB table. Implementation policies need to be carefully decided. Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Kenta Fukaya <kenta.fukaya@ntt.com> Yuta Kazato <yuta.kazato@ntt.com> Other contributors: Yusuke Niimi <niimi.yusuke@fujitsu.com> Yoshiyuki Katada <katada.yoshiyuk@fujitsu.com> Ayumu Ueha <ueha.ayumu@fujitsu.com> Work Items ---------- + Implement Tacker to support: + Add utility functions to integrate with an external key manager + Add sample implementations with v2API and OpenStack Key Manager + Add a configuration option. + Add new unit and functional tests. + Write Tacker documentation to explain how to use the function described in this specification. Dependencies ============ + Encryption methods for authentication credentials Depends on Secret Stores API in barbican [#Barbican_Stores_API]_. + Decryption methods for authentication credentials Depends on Secret Get by UUID API in barbican [#Barbican_Get_API]_. Testing ======= Unit and functional tests will be added to cover cases required in this specification.

We've seen release job failures caused by too large tarball, which
contains irrelevant files like git history.

Let's exclude these files to reduce size of the archive.

The file is copied from the puppetlabs repositories with some files
specific to OpenStack projects added.
