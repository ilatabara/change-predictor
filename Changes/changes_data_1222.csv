A combination of issues with puppet and rspec-puppet make it impossible
for rspec-puppet to properly load puppet/util/openstack when other
modules run tests against puppet-keystone. This patch works around the
issue by adding all directories in lib/puppet to the $LOAD_PATH prior
to attempting to use them.

Problem description =================== In Nova, we have a very loose way of modeling the resources that are consumed by virtual machine instances and provided by compute nodes. The Flavor object has a number of static fields that correspond to amounts of simple resources like CPU, RAM, and local disk. We use dictionaries of key/value pairs and JSON-serialized BLOBs of data to model other types of resources, like PCIe devices or NUMA cell layouts. The resource tracker on the compute node keeps track of the collection of resources that are consumed on the node. The `ResourceTracker.old_resources` attribute is a dictionary with a bunch of random nested dictionaries. Some of these nested dictionaries include the 'stats' dict for the extensible resource tracker, various 'pci_devices', 'pci_stats', and 'pci_passthrough_devices' things, a 'numa_topology' blob that stores a JSON-serialized representation of an object in `nova.virt.hardware`, and a 'metrics' dictionary with completely unstructured and undocumented key/value pairs. In addition to these unstructured nested dictionaries, the `ResourceTracker.old_resources` dictionary contains top-level keys including some that match the simple resource types that a Flavor object exposes: - `local_gb_used`: Amount of disk in GB used on the compute node - `local_gb`: Total GB of local disk capacity the compute node provides - `free_disk_gb`: Calculated amount of disk the compute node has available - `vcpus_used`: Number of vCPUs consumed on the compute node - `vcpus`: Total number of vCPUs the compute node provides - `free_vcpus`: Calculated number of vCPUs the compute node has available - `memory_mb_used`: Amount of RAM in MB used on the compute node - `memory_mb`: Total MB of RAM capacity the compute node provides - `free_ram_mb`: Calculated amount of RAM the compute node has available - `running_vms`: Number of virtual machine instances running on the node - `current_workload`: Some calculated value of the workload on the node Unfortunately, none of the above is documented in the code, and in order to add new features to the scheduler, people just continue to add these free-form keys and nested dictionaries to the dictionary. This makes communicating actual usage amounts to the scheduler error-prone: the resource tracker calls the `scheduler_client.update_resource_stats()` method, passing in this unstructured, unversioned dictionary of information as-is. This means the scheduler interface is incredibly fragile since the interface can be altered on a whim by any developer who decides to add a new key to the free-form dictionary of resources. Typos in resource dictionary keys can be very easy to miss in code reviews, and frankly, there is virtually no functional testing for a lot of the edge case code in the resource tracker around the extensible resource tracker. In addition to the problem of fragile interfaces, the free-form nature of the resources dictionary has meant that different resources are tracked in different ways. PCI resources are tracked one way, NUMA topology usage is tracked in a different way, CPU/RAM/disk is tracked differently, and any resources modeled in the complete free-for-all of the extensible resource tracker are tracked in an entirely different way, using plugins that modify a supplied 'stats' nested dictionary. An example of the mess this has created in the resource tracker can be seen here: .. code:: python def _update(self, context, values): """"""Update partial stats locally and populate them to Scheduler."""""" self._write_ext_resources(values) # NOTE(pmurray): the stats field is stored as a json string. The # json conversion will be done automatically by the ComputeNode object # so this can be removed when using ComputeNode. values['stats'] = jsonutils.dumps(values['stats']) if not self._resource_change(values): return if ""service"" in self.compute_node: del self.compute_node['service'] # NOTE(sbauza): Now the DB update is asynchronous, we need to locally # update the values self.compute_node.update(values) # Persist the stats to the Scheduler self._update_resource_stats(context, values) if self.pci_tracker: self.pci_tracker.save(context) If resources were actually modeled consistently, the above code would look like this instead: .. code:: python def _update(self, context, resources): if not self._resource_change(resources): return # Notify the scheduler about changed resources scheduler_client.update_usage_for_compute_node( context, self.compute_node.id, resources) Similarly, the following code in the existing resource tracker: .. code:: python def _update_usage(self, context, resources, usage, sign=1): mem_usage = usage['memory_mb'] overhead = self.driver.estimate_instance_overhead(usage) mem_usage += overhead['memory_mb'] resources['memory_mb_used'] += sign * mem_usage resources['local_gb_used'] += sign * usage.get('root_gb', 0) resources['local_gb_used'] += sign * usage.get('ephemeral_gb', 0) # free ram and disk may be negative, depending on policy: resources['free_ram_mb'] = (resources['memory_mb'] - resources['memory_mb_used']) resources['free_disk_gb'] = (resources['local_gb'] - resources['local_gb_used']) resources['running_vms'] = self.stats.num_instances self.ext_resources_handler.update_from_instance(usage, sign) # Calculate the numa usage free = sign == -1 updated_numa_topology = hardware.get_host_numa_usage_from_instance( resources, usage, free) resources['numa_topology'] = updated_numa_topology would instead look like this: .. code:: python def _update_usage(self, context, resources, usage, sign=1): for resource_type, amount in usage.items(): resources[resource_type].consume(amount*sign) Use Cases ---------- Nova contributors wish to extend the functionality of the scheduler and intend to break the scheduler out into the Gantt project. In order to do this effectively, the internal interfaces around the resource tracker and the scheduler must be cleaned up to use structured objects. Project Priority ----------------- Falls under the technical debt reduction category. Proposed change =============== Modeling requested and used resource amounts is the foundational building block that must be done first before any further refactoring or cleanup of the scheduler or resource tracker interfaces. This blueprint encompasses the addition of a set of model objects: - A set of classes that represent amounts of different types of resources - A set of classes that represent usage of different types of resources - A set of classes that represent different types of resources The resource tracker code will then be converted to use the above classes when representing usage of all resources on a compute node. Note that we do NOT propose any changes at this time to the database schema of the `compute_nodes` table or the fields in `nova.objects.ComputeNode`, however we do add translation methods to `nova.objects.ComputeNode` that will be able to construct a set of `UsageSpec` objects for each resource type on the compute node as well as set the existing fields on the `nova.objects.ComputeNode` object from a supplied set of `UsageSpec` objects. Alternatives ------------ None. Data model impact ----------------- None. The objects added in this blueprint are not stored in a database. These objects are a replacement for an unstructured nested dictionary that is currently used to represent resource amounts. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- The extensible resource tracker will be removed when this blueprint is completed. Developer impact ---------------- Once this blueprint is completed, code handling the construction of the request_spec will be much more structured, and much of the spaghetti code in the resource tracker around the ERT, PCI tracker, and NUMA topology quirks will go away. Implementation ============== There will be a generalized usage spec class interface that looks like this: .. code:: python class UsageSpec(object): """"""Represents the used amount of a particular type of resource."""""" def update(self, amount_spec): """"""Update the used amount of resources by the supplied amount. :param amount_spec: `AmountSpec` to modify the usage with. """""" raise NotImplementedError def has_room_for(self, amount_spec): """"""Determine if there is room to fit the supplied amount of resources. :param amount_spec: `AmountSpec` to determine if there is room for. :returns True if the supplied requested amount of resources is able to be consumed on the node, False otherwise. If the supplied `amount_spec` is negative, returns False . """""" raise NotImplementedError With the idea that *all* requested resources for an instance should be able to be compared to *all* resource usage records for a compute node in the same way, using code that looks like this: .. code:: python for resource_type, amount in request_spec.resources.items(): if compute_node.usages[resource_type].has_room_for(amount): # do something... perhaps claim resources on the compute # node, which might eventually call: compute_node.usages[resource_type].update(amount) Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: jaypipes Work Items ---------- - Add classes for requested and usage amount representation w/ unit tests - Add classes for resource type representation w/ unit tests - Add translation methods to `nova.objects.ComputeNode` to construct and decompose a set of `UsageSpec` objects w/ unit tests - Convert resource tracker to use usage amount objects instead of triples of free/total/used amounts in key/value pairs in a dictionary for the non-PCI, non-ERT, non-NUMA resources. - Remove the extensible resource tracker code. - Convert resource tracker to use usage amount objects instead of 'numa_topology' key and `nova.virt.hardware.VirtNUMATopology` object in the `old_resources` dictionary. - Convert resource tracker to use usage amount objects instead of 'pci_devices' and 'pci_passthrough_devices' keys and a `nova.pci.pci_stats.PciDeviceStats` object in the `pci_tracker` attribute of the resource tracker - Add developer reference documentation for how resources are modeled. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= New unit tests for the objects will be added. The existing unit tests of resource tracker will be overhauled in the patch set that converts the resource tracker to use the new resource object models instead of its current free-form dictionary of things. Documentation Impact ==================== There are currently no developer reference docs that explain how the different resources are tracked within Nova. Developer reference material that explains the new resource type and amount classes will be delivered as a part of this blueprint. References ========== This blueprint is part of an overall effort to clean up, version, and stabilize the interfaces between the nova-api, nova-scheduler, nova-conductor and nova-compute daemons that involve scheduling and resource decisions. - `detach-service-from-computenode` - `resource-objects` <-- this blueprint - `request-spec-object` - `sched-select-destinations-use-request-spec-object` - `placement-spec-object` - `condition-objects` - `sched-placement-spec-use-resource-objects` - `sched-placement-spec-use-condition-objects` - `sched-get-placement-claims` ",,343,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ====================== Code testing policy ====================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/code-testing-improvements Current unit/integration tests should follow a single code testing policy. Introduction paragraph -- why are we doing anything? A single paragraph of prose that operators can understand. Problem description =================== Right now ``fuel-web`` project doesn't have: * a strict rules of how the code is tested * which testing approach is used for particular component * tests composition rules * test grouping * unit and functional tests are located in a mess and don't correspond their purpose Proposed change =============== Each push request must have a test which makes sure the code is working. Push request is not merged in master until the functionality hasn't been covered with the tests. The component module/class/function can be tested in different ways and can have a set of unit/functional/integration tests. Every component has be covered with unit tests. The components to be covered with integration tests: * REST API handlers * Database interaction Unit tests are located in ``tests/unit/`` directory. The structure of unit tests mimics the project one. Integration tests are located in ``tests/integration`` and grouped by components name. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ Describe any potential performance impact on the system, for example how often will new code be called, and is there a major change to the calling pattern of existing code. Examples of things to consider here include: * A periodic task might look like a small addition but if it calls conductor or another service the load is multiplied by the number of nodes in the system. * Scheduler filters get called once per host for every instance being created, so any latency they introduce is linear with the size of the system. * A small change in a utility function or a commonly used decorator can have a large impacts on performance. * Calls which result in a database queries (whether direct or via conductor) can have a profound impact on performance when called in critical sections of the code. * Will the change include any locking, and if so what considerations are there on holding the lock? Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- Developers have to follow the code testing policy Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ivankliuk Other contributors: fuel-python Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Dependencies ============ * Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in fuel, or in other projects, that this one either depends on or is related to. * If this requires functionality of another project that is not currently used by Fuel, document that fact. * Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not included in Fuel? Or does it depend on a specific version of library? Testing ======= This document describes testing itself. Documentation Impact ==================== What is the impact on the docs team of this change? Some changes might require donating resources to the docs team to have the documentation updated. Don't repeat details discussed above, but please reference them here. References ========== Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any reference. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are: * Links to mailing list or IRC discussions * Links to relevant research, if appropriate * Related specifications as appropriate * Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to ",,188,0

This change ensures that 'file', 'filesystem', and 'swift+config' URI
schemes are not allowed when setting the location field. A previous
fix to CVE-2014-9493 attempted to address this issue but did not
include 'filesystem', a URI scheme allowed by the glance_store.

Without this fix in place it is possible for a client to access any file

This change makes the authentication process that requests a domain user

Authenticating with the user_id is more reliable, as that works even when
the username is truncated or modified in any other way before it is passed
to Keystone.

Juno, and it currently makes requirements updates to fail due to missing
oslo.context dependency in global-requirements.txt, so instead of adding it
there, let's just drop oslo.log installation from devstack.

That's Juno only, master is not touched.

Keystone password be changed from default to new one.

- use _wait() until Keystone password be changed
- check if reverted snapshot version is 5.x.x and use apropriate

This patch Ibc4307b406b71db258975da90a39c1f51ad27e12 changed
the RestClient so that it does not use the
CONF.compute.build_timeout variable anymore.

For this reason, there is no way to specify a timeout for the image
client, which inherits the hardcoded 60 seconds timeout.

This patch introduces a config option for this. For consistency,
a config option was added for build interval as well.

Collecting disk latency metrics can help us detect those issues. Hyper-V Inspector can collect those metrics. Problem description =================== Currently, when inspecting disk metrics, the Hyper-V Inspector cannot post any values for read_requests or write_requests, since this kind of metrics is not supported by Hyper-V. Instead, the Hyper-V Inspector can collect disk IOPS metrics, which will give users a useful alternative. Proposed change =============== Add DiskIOPSPollster and PerDeviceDiskIOPSPollster pollsters, which create samples having the properties: * name: 'disk.iops' * type: 'gauge' * unit: 'count/second' Add 'iops_count' to the DiskStats object and add this field to the DiskStats object returned by the 'inspect_disks' method in HyperVInspector. The metric value will be fetched from Hyper-V VMs, located in the Msvm_AggregationMetricValue object (further refered to as metric object) associated with the VMs. The metric object's 'MetricDefinitionId' must be equal to the 'Id' of Msvm_AggregationMetricDefinition object having the Caption 'Average Normalized Disk Throughput'. Hyper-V disk metrics were introduced in Windows / Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 (kernel version 6.3). They are not supported in the previous versions.

Provide functional tests on the application (in addition to existing functional tests). Make a devstack gate with these tests. Problem description =================== For now we have some functional tests. But they just directly use the interface (call/cast/listen). More complicated use-cases are not covered. They also don't give a living example of what problems could be solved with the API. We also have some unit tests, but as you know it is not enough to be confident when pushing changes. Unit tests tell us all covered methods perform as they are expected to. There is still a need of some more high-level automatic check. Proposed change =============== Existing functional tests should be extended. To provide richer test cases we need to implement some application layer (advanced fixture). There could be a messenger application with open API built on top of oslo libraries. Tests for the messenger functionality would also cover oslo.messaging, but in terms of the application. Lets specify some high-level scope of the messenger. 1. Client is a dynamic entity which represents the person on the network ready for chat. It can appear online, send textual messages to other clients, then disappear. Cleints speak to each other directly. The problem for now is to discover other clients on the network. 2. Server is a static entity with known address. It's main purpose is to manage clients lists. It serves for clients to discover each other. 3. Clients list is to be synchronized between all participants of conversation. Clients list is published by the server periodically or it can be obtained by request. 4. Clients list item contains information about a client: - Name - name of the client - Address (IP:Port) - address to identify client on the network - Online/Offline, etc. 5. Message is an object which is sent between clients. Clients speak to each other directly. This means that Server has no idea about messages and doesn't keep message history. 6. History is simply speaking a message list, stored conversation between two clients or a group of clients. .. note:: Group chats are not detailed yet, but such feature will help us covering multicast functionality. .. note:: Such an application may cover not only oslo.messaging, but if we would like to have some persistence of message history we could use oslo.db APIs to save/restore the data. Returning to our main purpose, how can the functional test look like: .. code-block:: python cfg.setOption('server', '192.168.0.101:9090') # means we can substitute any driver for test cfg.setOption('messaging.driver', 'zmq') client1 = messenger.Client(cfg, 'Bob') client2 = messenger.Client(cfg, 'Alice') sv1 = messenger.Server(cfg) sv1.run() client1.run() client2.run() time.sleep(2) # wait for all instances discover each other assertEquals(sv1.clientsList, client1.clientsList, client2.clientsList) client1.sendMessage('Alice', 'Hi, there!') asserEquals(client1.history['Alice'], client2.history['Bob']) Here we don't call any of the oslo APIs directly. So we test the API indirectly via the application layer. What are the benefits of such approach? 1. Application gives us a real use-case to test. 2. Test scalability of the underlying framework with the application (rabbit compared to zmq). 3. We have an alternative way of reproducing oslo bugs without deployment of the whole Openstack. 4. An example of the API usage easy to understand for newcomers. Alternatives ------------ https://github.com/openstack/taskflow/tree/master/taskflow/examples The examples all get tested during unit test runs to ensure they work as expected. We can implement a set of examples for oslo.messaging in the same manner as in taskflow, but such approach seems to be more synthetic than the app. The solid application may need more effort to implement but it seems to be more natural way of using the API. Impact on Existing APIs ----------------------- None Security impact --------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Configuration Impact -------------------- None Developer Impact ---------------- Any future changes to oslo.messaging API should be reflected in the application.

This patch allows to create a slo manifest when the manifest

The _fmt_msg() function constructs a debug message using
identity attributes from the request environ dict, but
accesses these using keys such as X_USER_ID, when the
correct key should be HTTP_X_USER_ID. Consequently no
identity attribute values are ever included in the debug
log message.

This patch adds the missing HTTP_ prefix to the keys and
adds an assertion to the unit tests to verify that the debug
log is generated as expected.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Cinder Objects ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/cinder-objects The goal of this spec is to introduce objects into cinder. An object is used to bundle data with methods that can operate on them. By using objects, we have a standardized interface to the database, as well as standardize the data passed between cinder services over RPC. This separates the code from the actual database implementation, making it easier for rolling upgrades. Problem description =================== There are a few problems that exists today in cinder: * Cinder converts everything to a primitive before sending it over RPC. These objects are the sqlalchemy objects that come from the database API. If the database schema changes, it could break the existing code that uses these objects. * sqlalchemy objects do not have a version associated with it. If the database schema changes, the code could be broken since it was expecting certain attributes to be present that may no longer be present in the new schema. * sqlalchemy objects attributes do not enforce the type of data that they should contain. For example, a string can be assigned instead of an integer from the API layer and it makes it to the database, where mysql automatically converts it. Proposed change =============== Most of the work on objects has been done by nova and can be reused in cinder. The plan is to copy over the the base object code (i.e. nova/objects/base.py) and modify it to fit into cinder. The base object code in nova will give us: built-in serialization, attribute validation, implementation to track attribute changes, backwards-compatible support for dict-based objects, and methods (that should be extended) to query and modify the database. By using objects, we can reduce the risk made by database schema changes. Each object will have a major and minor version number associated with it. This makes it easier to identify methods and attributes that should be associated with it, and reduces the risk of old code breaking new database schemas and vice versa. Furthermore, by defining the attributes and data types an object can have, we can enforce what the object will look like and validate the attributes being assigned to it, reducing TypeError exceptions from occurring. By using objects, we have a standardized interface to the database, as well as standardize the data passed between cinder services over RPC. CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations that were normally kicked off by a call to cinder/db/api.py can now be kicked off by directly by a call to the object methods. The work will be done incrementally in stages, as follows. * Port over nova object code base * Add service, volume, volume type, snapshot, quota, backup, consistency group and consistency group snapshot objects * Iteratively convert cinder internals to use these objects The following is the skeleton of the base object class, taken from nova/objects/base.py.

Alternatives ------------ The existing implementation of direct database calls can be left as-is. There are proposals for state machine/state enforcement and RPC versioning, which would help with rolling upgrades and improve the stability of cinder. However, there will continue to be direct database calls, and data passed between cinder service continue to be primitives. We would still have to be careful to validate data types and accepted values that can go into the database. Data model impact ----------------- None. The objects being introduced are not stored in the database. Instead, these objects are a replacement for dictionaries that is being used to represent service, volume, volume type, snapshot, quota, backup, consistency group and consistency group snapshot throughout cinder internals. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- Today, direct database calls are made to create, read, update, and delete volumes, volume types, snapshots, quotas, backups, consistency groups and consistency group snapshots, and others. With the switch to an object model, these calls will be made against the appropriate object methods. It will take some time to convert cinder internals over to the object model, so the existing convention of direct database calls should be accepted until all object models are in place. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: thang-pham Other contributors: Any help is welcome Work Items ---------- * Copy over nova/objects/base.py and modify it to fit cinder * Add service object * Add volume object * Add volume type object * Add snapshot object * Add quota object * Add backup object * Add consistency group object * Add consistency group snapshot object * Iteratively convert cinder internals to use these objects Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= By introducing objects, we are not changing the API or functionality of cinder. We are standardizing the data passed between cinder services and the interface to the database. Given this, no new tempest tests will be created. However, relevant unit tests will be created to test the new object code base.

Trying to delete default security group from a non-admin
user gives an error ""Removing default security group not
allowed. (HTTP 400).
But this message is not clear as the user does not get to
know why is he not allowed to remove the default security
group.

So updated the error message to give a more optimal message
to the user.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Better Version Management in Cloudera Plugin ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sahara/+spec/cdh-version-management This specification proposes to manage different versions of CDH in Cloudera plugin in a better solution. Problem description =================== Current situation of CDH version management in CDH plugin: * We do not have version control for CDH plugin at all. * Due to backward support requirement, all existing codes need to support CDH version from 5.0.0 to latest (currently it is 5.3.0). This will cause below issues: * When new packages are released, we do not know whether our plugin still can work. In fact nobody can ensure that. * Our work have to be based on a non-static environment. * Backward-compatibility is desired, but it is not ensured at all. For example, we are not sure tomorrow whether a new released CDH package will be compatible with old plugin codes or configuration files. * CI-test results are not stable, so we cannot always turn it into voting. * If new released package version bring issues, it can block all developers even if they do not work on this version. * When we do not want to support some obsolete versions, we cannot easily remove it. Proposed change =============== * Add package version constraints, and give a key packages version list to support CDH5.3.0 (or 5.2.0), and base our development only on this. * Freeze the package to prevent later CDH release come in. * Add sub-directories in plugin/cdh, like 5_3_0 for CDH5.3.0 to support different versions of CDH. As we did for vanilla and hdp plugins. * We also need to do some modifications in sahara-image-elements project to support different versions of CDH image build. * We need to change sahara-ci-config project to break current cdh tests into several tests for different CDH versions. All new added versions should not break old version tests. For example, current gate-sahara-nova-direct-cdh_ubuntu-aio will be separated into sahara-nova-direct-cdh_5.0_ubuntu-aio and sahara-nova-direct-cdh_5.3.0_ubuntu-aio. * Break sahara/tests/integration/tests/gating/test_cdh_gating.py into several files, like test_cdh5_0_0_gating.py and test_cdh5_3_0_gating.py to support different CDH versions. * We need not ensure backward compatibility. E.g., CDH5.3.0 codes are not required to work for CDH5.0.0. We may add some features and codes only for later version of CDH, which was not supported by former CDH version. * If we want to add more CDH versions in the future, we need to open a BP to do this. For example, if we want to support CDH 5.4.0 in the future, below works are required: * Add a directory 5_3_0 including codes to support CDH 5.3.0 in plugin/cdh. * Modify scripts in sahara/image-elements/elements/hadoop_cloudera, to add functions to install packages for CDH 5.4.0, while still keeping functions installing packages for former CDH versions. * Add a test_cdh5_4_0_gating.py in sahara/tests/integration/tests/gating directory for integration test. * Add a new ci-test item in sahara-ci-config, like gate-sahara-nova-direct-cdh_5.4.0_ubuntu-aio. We can set this item as non-voting at the beginning, and after it is tuned and verified ok, we set it back to voting.

At first we mark it as non-voting. After it is verified, we can mark it as voting. * Test and evaluate the change.

The REST API relies on neutron-specific policy checking logic that is
only available after the extensions are loaded and the
RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP is populated. This patch resets the policies
immediately after these steps are done. This ensures that in the event
the policies are prematurely loaded for any reason, the on-demand
loading of the policies will reload the policies and properly configure
the neutron specific checks on the next policy check.

There is an rpc interface defined for the Neutron plugin to be able to
execute methods in the DHCP agent.  Provide docstring pointers in the
client and server side that tells you where to find the other side of
the interface.

No namespace usage is needed here.  This API is the only one exposed
via the DHCP agent, so the default namespace used now is fine.

The DhcpAgent class was updated to explicitly define the
messaging.Target().  Previously it was using the equivalent one
defined in the Manager base class.  Having it specified here makes it
more obvious that this is an rpc endpoint, and also provides the
obvious place that must have the version updated if the interface is
changed.

This adds a deprecation helper/utility that libraries can use
to aid in deprecated common patterns; for example a class that
was moved to another location, renamed kwarg, a moved property
or a moved inheritable class...

These patterns are hopefully useful for the various oslo libraries
to use in the future as deprecation becomes an important way to
change the various oslo libraries in ways that does not break
compatibility.

This module originates from taskflow where it has been used for
similar purposes for a little while now. The current recommendation
is that this (or similar logic) should be used for developer to
developer interactions (and not for developer to deployer
interactions, which should use versionutils and its logging
mechanism instead).

To enable these types of messages one the following will have to
be used with the library using program:

$ python -Wonce $program
$ python -Wall $program

Or inside the program binaries (like in cinder):

    import warnings
    warnings.simplefilter('once', DeprecationWarning)

It can also be plugged into the logging system via:

https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logging.captureWarnings

Or something like:

There are some duplicated and useless policy enforcement at nova-network
FlatManager. The floatingip related function just stubbed out for FlatManager
and the same policies already enforcement at network api layer:

https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/669e1c5d3ad2fd6bdaff69c0805bbb87da509036/
nova/network/api.py#L170

If the request violated the policy rule, the network api layer enforcement will
stop the request, it nerver can reach the nova network manager side.

This patch just clean them up.

Partially implements blueprint v3-api-policy

Cinder supports volume transfers, which are transfers of ownership from
one project to another.  The normal flow is that a donor creates a volume
transfer, captures the resulting transfer id and secret authentication
key, and passes that information out of band to the recipient (such as
by email, text message, etc.).  The recipient then accepts the transfer,
supplying the transfer id and authentication key.  The ownership of the
volume is then transferred from the donor to the recipient, and the
volome is no longer visible to the donor.

It is important to know of some limitations about the cinder API for
volume transfers and their impact on the UI design.
1. When creating a volume transfer, you cannot specify who the intended
   recipient will be, and anyone with the transfer ID and auth key can
   claim the volume.  Therefore there is no UI to prompt for a
   recipient.
2. Current volume transfers are only visible to the donor; users in
   other projects are unable to view these transfers.  This makes it
   pointless to create a project table to view and accept volume
   transfers, since the current transfers are not visible.  Instead, the
   transfer information has been added to the volume details, which are
   visible by the donor, and the volume state clearly reflects that a
   transfer has been created.  It it also impossible to present to the
   recipient a pull-down list of transfers to accept.
3. The only time that the authorization key is visible to the donor is
   in the response from the creation of the transfer; after creation it
   is impossible for even the donor to recover it.  Since the donor must
   capture the transfer ID and authorization key in order to send it to
   the recipient, an extra form was created to present this information
   to the donor immediately after the transfer has been created.  It is
   not enough to put the information in a success message, since these
   are typically only displayed for a small number of seconds before
   they disappear.

Sahara must support such way too. Problem description =================== There are two common ways to enable HTTPS for the OpenStack service: 1. TLS proxy. Proxy communicates with user via HTTPS and redirects all requests to service via unsecured HTTP. Keystone is configured to point on HTTPS port. Internal port is usually closed for outside using firewall. No additional work to support HTTPS required on service side. 2. Native support. Service can be configured to expect HTTPS connections. In this case service handles all security aspects by itself. Most OpenStack services support both types of enabling SSL. Sahara currently can be secured only using TLS proxy. Proposed change =============== Add ability to Sahara API to listen on HTTPS port. Currently there is no unified way for OpenStack services to work with HTTPS. Process of unification started with sslutils module in oslo-incubator. Sahara could use this module to be on the same page with other services. Alternatives ------------ Copy-past SSL-related code from other OpenStack project. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- * python-saharaclient should support SSL-related options Deployer impact --------------- One more option to consider. Developer impact ---------------- None Sahara-image-elements impact ---------------------------- None Sahara-dashboard / Horizon impact --------------------------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: alazarev (Andrew Lazarev) Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Implement feature in Sahara * Import sslutils * Configure WSGI server to HTTPS * Add support to python-saharaclient * Add support to devstack * Add documentation Dependencies ============ * sslutils module from oslo-incubator Testing ======= Devstack doesn't have HTTPS testing for now. It looks like manual testing is the only option. Documentation Impact ==================== Need to be documented. References ========== None,,125,0

We have a race condition where the call to create an
iscsi target seems to be issued twice.  This patch
adds some debug logging to try and get some more info
around where things are going wrong.

First, we add a log message to the intialize_connection call
in the cinder.volume.api and include the connector info.

Second, we add a target show output prior to the update/create
command in the target driver.

In addition, we also had the update and show commands in the same
try/except block which led us to believe the show was failing,
but that's NOT the case at all.  So this patch also moves that
existing show (debug purposes as well) out of the main try block.

Note that there are some old bugs logged against TgtAdm for issues
with it ""loosing count"" of target id's it's issued, and in turn
reissuing the same ID multiple times.  This patch is intended to
give us enough info to determine if that's what's going on or not.

Other possibility is that the initialize call is being issued more
than once.

Some of Rally benchmarks related to Cinder are failing often.
Especially benchmarks that attach volumes.

Adding all Cinder related benchmarks to cinder gate to help
Cinder team to fix issues.

As well make this job put to Jenkins +1/-1.
For that we added for every benchmark sla section
that checks that there is no failed iterations.

While transitioning to the new driver and target
model (change 9651f547147188645942466602c92cce06666483)
some things got lost not surprisingly.  One of those
things that wasn't migrated correctly was the
iscsi_write_cache option due to ensure_export not
being called properly on service restart.

This patch cleans up the ensure/create_export methods
and their signatures.  Most importantly esnure_export
should now actually work and check the iscsi_write_cache
settings.

While fixing this I also cleaned up the two methods
mentioned above to eliminate the unnecessary and
duplicate info in their arguments.

These dependencies allow tighter integration between bootstrap and angular,
and a much cleaner, flexible and feature-rich framework for handling tabular
data.

Changes in this version:

- updated smart-table to 1.4.5.2 to re-work contents of package

The whole service catalog is embedded in every token, and by default
all token responses are logged at DEBUG. This adds a huge amount of
basically const data into system logs, over and over and over again.

We should not log the service catalog by default on every token
response. The following replaces the service catalog with the token
<removed>.

This reduces the compressed logs of API services by about 1/3.

This provides the watchdog.watch function which is a contextmanager
that can be used before doing operations that have a high risk of
deadlocking or aberrantly taking huge amounts of time to complete
(which could be the root cause for other issues).

Unit tests require the use of sleep to make the timers pop either
before or after the event in question. There is 1 second buffer that's
encoded into each scenario which should be sufficient for unit tests
(even in busy systems). If that turns into an issue later, the buffer
can be increased (I was only seeing real skew of 1-2 ms locally).

As the comment in the code says, if a user wants to enable the

This patch contains a few changes to the state model.

The first is a fix for an issue caught by Ruby in post-merge review:

- fsm.py initialize() did not set _target_state, which led to some
  incorrect calculations during subsequent state transitions.

Additionally, in the Juno release, the DEPLOYDONE state was exposed only
on the target_provision_state field, and never set as the current
provision state.

- Commit b49470e1 incorrectly expressed DEPLOYDONE as a current
  provision state. With this patch, current provision state transitions
  from DEPLOYING directly to ACTIVE, as it did in Juno. A subsequent
  patch should introduce the DEPLOYED state.

- In accordance with bp/new-ironic-state-machine, target_provision_state
  is changed from DEPLOYDONE to ACTIVE during the deploy phase.

Similarly, in the Juno release, the DELETED state was exposed only
on the target_provision_state field.

- In accordance with bp/new-ironic-state-machine, target_provision_state
  is changed from DELETED to NOSTATE (which will become AVAILABLE)
  during the deletion phase.

The keystoneclient tests were using the library installed from a
git clone. Rather than do a clone of master, the tests will now just
use the keystoneclient installed to the venv.

Doing a `git clone` causes problems on any system without reliable
Internet access, and since the keystoneclient tests have changed to
being for functional tests rather than for verifying
backwards-compatibility of the client, this will make things easier.

The ring builder's placement algorithm has two goals: first, to ensure
that each partition has its replicas as far apart as possible, and
second, to ensure that partitions are fairly distributed according to
device weight. In many cases, it succeeds in both, but sometimes those
goals conflict. When that happens, operators may want to relax the
rules a little bit in order to reach a compromise solution.

Imagine a cluster of 3 nodes (A, B, C), each with 20 identical disks,
and using 3 replicas. The ring builder will place 1 replica of each
partition on each node, as you'd expect.

Now imagine that one disk fails in node C and is removed from the
ring. The operator would probably be okay with remaining at 1 replica
per node (unless their disks are really close to full), but to
accomplish that, they have to multiply the weights of the other disks
in node C by 20/19 to make C's total weight stay the same. Otherwise,
the ring builder will move partitions around such that some partitions
have replicas only on nodes A and B.

If 14 more disks failed in node C, the operator would probably be okay
with some data not living on C, as a 4x increase in storage
requirements is likely to fill disks.

This commit introduces the notion of ""overload"": how much extra
partition space can be placed on each disk *over* what the weight
dictates.

For example, an overload of 0.1 means that a device can take up to 10%
more partitions than its weight would imply in order to make the
replica dispersion better.

Overload only has an effect when replica-dispersion and device weights
come into conflict.

The overload is a single floating-point value for the builder
file. Existing builders get an overload of 0.0, so there will be no
behavior change on existing rings.

In the example above, imagine the operator sets an overload of 0.112
on his rings. If node C loses a drive, each other drive can take on up
to 11.2% more data. Splitting the dead drive's partitions among the
remaining 19 results in a 5.26% increase, so everything that was on
node C stays on node C. If another disk dies, then we're up to an
11.1% increase, and so everything still stays on node C. If a third
disk dies, then we've reached the limits of the overload, so some
partitions will begin to reside solely on nodes A and B.

The AlarmCreationBolt now caches AlarmDefinitions and Alarms for
quicker evaluation of incoming metrics. Incoming metrics end up in one
of these buckets:

1. Fits into an existing Alarm
2. Causes a new Alarm to be created
3. Already exists in an existing Alarm

All of these require the analysis of existing Alarms. I tried writing SQL
to do this analysis but it just wasn't fast enough so instead I added
the caching of the Alarm Definitions and Alarms.

The AlarmCreationBolt now needs to process Alarm deletion message so
that stream from the EventProcessingBolt had to be hooked up to the
AlarmCreationBolt.

The AlarmCreationBolt used to incorrectly handle
Alarm Definition Updated events.

Improved the queries in AlarmDAOImpl to be more efficient by using
fewer queries intsead of multiple queries per Alarm. However the
AlarmDAOImplTest now requires a real mysql instance since the h2
emulator doesn't understand ""group_concat"". Mark that test as
only run for target integration-test

Turn on tests for target integration-test

Previous code was not reusing Metrics from existing Alarms
all times it should have. Added test for this case

Changed info messages to debug to lessen normal logging.

Added more tests of existing and new functionality

Added some timing code for debug

Removed unused code

Added more debug logging code

Added reference to API doc for Alarm Definitions in README

Currently, there are some cases libvirt cannot inspect instance's memory
usage, and it is a normal behavior so libvirt just logs messages and

AttributeError will be raised in such case, which leading to unnecessary

This patch uses virt.inspector exceptions for libvirt, so when there is no

run tests with:

   tox -egabbi

It requires mongodb, which tox will start for you.

In order to limit the number of services required, a new publisher
is made available. It is called 'direct' and directly calls the
DatabaseDispatcher to write samples to the metering database. This
means that no messaging bus is required. A stripped down
gabbi_pipeline.yaml is provided to the test harness.

Note that this review isn't really expected to pass all the tests.
It's here primarily to provide an easy way to access the branch that
the code is on so that people may hack on it. That hacking should
lead to a better understanding of how fixtures need to work and
the kinds of inspection required in response testing.

TripleO currently supports using Puppet for configuration using Heat metadata directly via the normal os-collect-config/os-refresh-config agents. No puppet-master or puppet DB infrastructure is required. Building Images --------------- When building TripleO images for use with Puppet the following elements should be installed: -hosts -os-net-config -os-collect-config -heat-config-puppet -puppet-modules -hiera The hosts and os-net-config are normal TripleO image elements and are still used to deploy basic physical networking configuration required to bootstrap the node. The os-collect-config, and heat-config-puppet elements provide mechanism to run 'puppet apply' commands that have been configured via Heat software deployment configurations. The puppet-modules element installs all of the required stackforge puppet-* modules. This element has two modes of operation: packages or source installs. The package implementation assumes that all of the required modules exist in a single distribution provided package. The source version deploys the puppet modules from Git at image build time and automatically links them into /etc/puppet/modules. The source implementation makes use of source repositories so you can do things like this: Example (pinning to a specific puppetlabs-mysql module version): DIB_REPOREF_puppetlabs_mysql=<GIT COMMIT HASH> The hiera element provides to configure the hiera.yaml and hieradata files on each node directly via Heat metadata. The tripleo-heat-templates are use to drive this configuration. When building images for use with Puppet it is important to note that regardless of whether you use source or package mode to install these core elements the actual OpenStack service packages (Nova, Neutron, Keystone, etc) will need to be via a normal distro package. This is required in order to work well with the stackforge puppet modules. The OpenStack service packages can be installed at DIB time via the -p option or at deployment time when Puppet is executed on each node. It should be noted that pre-installing packages may not work well on some distributions if services automatically started (Debian, Ubuntu). Installing packages at deployment time allows you to build smaller images and optionally deploy your entire cluster with a single image. Heat Templates -------------- When deploying an overcloud with heat only the newer overcloud-without-mergepy.yaml supports Puppet. To enable Puppet simply use the overcloud-resource-registry-puppet.yaml instead of the normal overcloud-resource-registry.yaml with your heat stack-create command. Running Devtest Overcloud with Delorean on Fedora ------------------------------------------------- This section describes the variables required in order to run devtest_overcloud.sh with Puppet. It assumes you have a fully working TripleO undercloud (or seed) which has been preconfigured to work in your environment. Pre-existing configs from a normal devtest Fedora setup: export NODE_DIST='fedora selinux-permissive' export DIB_RELEASE=20 export RDO_RELEASE=juno # Enable packages for all elements by default export DIB_DEFAULT_INSTALLTYPE=package 1) Git clone the tripleo-puppet-elements [1]_ project into your $TRIPLEO_ROOT. This is currently a non-standard image elements repository and needs to be manually cloned in order to build Puppet images. 2) Add tripleo-puppet-elements to your ELEMENTS_PATH. export ELEMENTS_PATH=$ELEMENTS_PATH:$TRIPLEO_ROOT/tripleo-puppet-elements/elements 3) Setup variables to override the normal DIB image elements: export OVERCLOUD_CONTROL_DIB_ELEMENTS='hosts baremetal dhcp-all-interfaces os-collect-config heat-config-puppet puppet-modules hiera os-net-config delorean-repo rdo-release' export OVERCLOUD_COMPUTE_DIB_ELEMENTS='sysctl ntp hosts baremetal dhcp-all-interfaces os-collect-config heat-config-puppet puppet-modules hiera os-net-config delorean-repo rdo-release' 4) Override the tripleo-heat-templates resource registry: export RESOURCE_REGISTRY_PATH=""$TRIPLEO_ROOT/tripleo-heat-templates/overcloud-resource-registry-puppet.yaml"" 5) Explicitly disable the USE_MARIADB flag on Fedora. This is because it injects extra elements into the DIB arguments which we do not want when using Puppet. export USE_MARIADB=0 6) Configure your Delorean repo URL. This is used to fetch more recently built upstream packages for your OpenStack services: export DELOREAN_REPO_URL=""http://209.132.178.33/repos/current"" For more information on Delorean see [2]_ 7) Enable the use of stackforge modules from Git. This is to work around the fact that the Fedora RPM doesn't have puppet-keepalived yet. export DIB_INSTALLTYPE_puppet_modules=source 8) Source your undercloud environment RC file (perhaps via the select-cloud script). Then execute devtest_overcloud.sh using the new no-mergepy templates: devtest_overcloud.sh --no-mergepy References ---------- ..

The tests were assuming that extension drivers (such as federation
and revoke_api) were always loaded. These drivers were only
available because a previous test had imported the module and its
factory method is stored in global state in the dependency module.

The base Testcase is changed to not set up the saml2 and oauth1
auth plugins by default. The saml2 auth plugin depends on the
federation API which is only available when the extension is
loaded; similarly for the oauth1 auth plugin.

A new method is added to base TestCase to allow the TestCase to
provide more drivers to load during setUp. The TestCases that need
to load an optional backend make use of it.

The undercloud heat template was missing some rabbit properties,
which caused ceilometer on the undercloud to spin while trying to
connect to the rabbit server.  This cluttered up the logs and
wasted CPU while ceilometer retried the connection in vain.

Also, it seems unlikely ceilometer was actually working right. :-)

In an attempt to make the proposal bot changes for requirements be
more meaningful make the update.py script return something that's more
user friendly.

Now by default the script will return the following to stdout on success:

Version change for: mox, mox3, testrepository, testtools
Updated project/test-requirements.txt:
    mox==0.5.3                     ->   mox>=0.5.3
    mox3==0.7.3                    ->   mox3>=0.7.0
    testrepository>=0.0.13         ->   testrepository>=0.0.17
    testtools>=0.9.27              ->   testtools>=0.9.32

Add a verbose flag that will provide much of the previous debug info.

Eliminate the giant dict dump of all the requirements files, as that
was largely impossible to make sense of, and rarely provided any
insight. During a devstack run you'll have git hashes for all the
trees, so can track down exact file contents if needed.

By making this the default stdout we can then capture and use this for
the git commit messages.

In order to make the test output matching human readable ignore the 80
column limit for the expected blocks via #noqa.

When a users quota for any given service is zero, the pie charts
showing this remain empty. This is not helpful behaviour, as an
empty chart indicates available quota - only the numeric values
show that the current quota is filled, making the chart redundant.
We changed the charts to be full when a quota is zero, as this

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================================== In-band hardware properties discovery via ironic-discoverd ========================================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ironic/+spec/inband-properties-discovery This spec adds support for discovering hardware properties for pure IPMI-based drivers using ironic-discoverd project. ironic-discoverd [1] is a StackForge project for conducting hardware properties discovery via booting a special discovery ramdisk and interrogating hardware from within it. ..note:: Term ""hardware discovery"" is used through this spec as a synonym to ""hardware introspection"" or ""hardware interrogation"" as opposed to ""new hardware auto-discovery"", which is not covered by this spec. Problem description =================== Currently there is no generic way in Ironic to discover scheduling properties of a given peace of hardware. While multiple out-of-band methods are proposed, they are restricted each to a particular vendor (currently HP and DELL). This proposal will make hardware discovery possible for every driver that can power on and off the machine. A couple of future use cases may need in-band discovery even on hardware supporting out-of-band discovery, namely: * Detecting driver for a node. Operator will be able to start with generic IPMI driver and the discovery process will figure out better matching driver (e.g. DRAC). * Auto-discovery of nodes. While out of scope for now, it may be considered later, and may require in-band discovery. * Vendor-specific extensions for discovery, discovering properties that are not available via out-of-band means etc. ..note:: This spec does not touch any of these use cases directly. Proposed change =============== * Add new configuration option ``discoverd_url`` (string, no default). * Add new configuration option ``discovery_timeout`` (integer, seconds, default to e.g. 1 hour). This should be quite large, as *ironic-discoverd* will have it's own timeouts. This option accounts for sudden death or internal error of *ironic-discoverd*. * Implement ``discover_hardware_properties`` for both ``IPMIManagement`` interfaces: * Verify that *discoverd_url* is provided and ``ironic_discoverd`` module can be imported, otherwise fail with ``NotImplementedError``. * Set *WAIT* flag for a node. * Call to ``ironic_discoverd.client.discover`` providing node UUID. * Implement timeouts for discovery. There should be a periodic task in the conductor, checking that every mapped node is not in DISCOVERING state for more then ``discovery_timeout``. Alternatives ------------ * We could stay with out-of-band discovery only. As stated above, it's not covering all possible use cases. * In-band discovery could be implemented within Ironic itself, without 3rd party service. This is believed to be a unnecessary complication to Ironic code base. Data model impact ----------------- No direct impact expected. REST API impact --------------- No direct REST API impact. RPC API impact -------------- None Driver API impact ----------------- None Nova driver impact ------------------ None Security impact --------------- The code within Ironic has no security impact. Presence of *ironic-discoverd* itself has one security issue: * Endpoint receiving data from the ramdisk is not authenticated. For this reason *ironic-discoverd* will verify that node is in DISCOVERING state before updating it. Also current policy is to never overwrite existing properties. That may be changed however, according to Ironic needs. Other end user impact --------------------- Users will be able to discover hardware properties for drivers, not supporting out-of-band discovery. Scalability impact ------------------ * *ironic-discoverd* requires more network calls then out-of-band discovery: * Call to *ironic-discoverd* API * *ironic-discoverd* communicating with Ironic for checking node state * *ironic-discoverd* asking Ironic to reboot the machine * The machine PXE-booting * The ramdisk calling back to *ironic-discoverd* * *ironic-discoverd* communication with Ironic to update node state With at least 6 times more network calls than with out-of-band discovery, in-band discovery may limit scalability. * *ironic-discoverd* currently requires one PXE boot server and one TFTP server to serve all the requests to boot discovery ramdisk. I believe that these concerns are not critical, if discovery happens not too often and in reasonable bulks of nodes. Performance Impact ------------------ Call to *ironic-discoverd* is mostly async, only basic sanity checks are done in a sync fashion, before returning control back to the conductor. Other deployer impact --------------------- * New option: ``discoverd_url`` (string, no default) with the URL of *ironic-discoverd* * New option: ``discovery_timeout`` (integer, in seconds, default to 1 hour) with the amount of time after which discovery is considered to be failed and node is moved to DISCOVERYFAIL state. * *ironic-discoverd* and required services (like dnsmasq and TFTP server) should be deployed and managed separately, see the README [1] for details. * *ironic-discoverd* support will be optional and disabled by default, thus no impact on fresh or upgraded installations. Developer impact ---------------- None for now. Driver developers may use *ironic-discoverd* support to provide in-band hardware discovery for their hardware. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Dmitry Tantsur, LP: divius, IRC: dtantsur Work Items ---------- * Add new configuration options and wrapper around ``ironic_discoverd.client`` * Add ``discover_hardware_properties`` to ``IPMIManagement`` (both of them) * Implement timeouts in the conductor (if not implemented by the parent spec) Dependencies ============ * Generic bits for the discovery: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/100951 * *ironic-discoverd* package should be installed from PyPI or RDO to enable this feature Testing ======= * Unit testing with mocking ``ironic_discoverd.client`` for now * As a follow-up I hope to add support for *ironic-discoverd* to devstack and then have a functional test. This however will consume much time and depends on the functional testing discussions going on. Upgrades and Backwards Compatibility ==================================== None Documentation Impact ==================== It should be documented how to enable in-band discovery within Ironic. The documentation should point to *ironic-discoverd* README for the installation instruction. References ========== [1] *ironic-discoverd*: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ironic-discoverd ",,233,0

These were pretty simple tests but were relying on creating the snapshot
and image mappings in the database for some setup and as parts of the
utility methods (when get raises NotFound, create the mapping and return
an id).

The DB API functionality doesn't need to be tested here, that's done in
the actual objects unit tests for these in

To be fair, this is a bit uglier compared to the previous tests (which

We have 3-stages based deployment model.

Pre/Post stages deploys by tasks, and all dependencies will be
managed on tasks level. Parameter 'role' will serve as mapper to
nailgun node entities

Main deployment will be roles-based (where each role is group of tasks),
and we need to show that tasks and groups is different things, and therefore
edges that connect task to group, and group to tasks is different and will
be treated differently in nailgun. For this purpose two additional
parameters are introduced:

groups - specify dependency from task to all groups, where this task will be applied
tasks - specify dependency from group to all required tasks

Parameter role in task for main deployment will be used as mapper for nailgun nodes entities

The username and password combination is considered insecure to store in
the metadata passed to the stack as they can easily be obtained and
possibly used in an unathorized manner by logging into one of the
registration systems. The use of an activation key is more desirable
as it can only be used in conjunction with subscription-manager to
register a RHEL system.

This patch deprecates the username and password support from the script
that registers RHEL with either Satellite or RH Customer Portal during
boot-time.  This patch also adds a warning if the username and password
combination is used in the stack metadata. The documentation and examples
have also been updated to warn operators of the deprecation of username
and password.

This patch does not affect the username and password support for
registration activities while building images with diskimage-builder.

Previously the REG_REPOS value was a space delimited list of repo

If you pass a list in json through the heat parameter, the output

This patch changes the rhel-registration scripts to process the

For the moment we have error suppressing only for cleanup of Manila resources.
Add error suppressing to cleanup of isolated creds resources too.
It is useful for case of CI Tempest jobs, where we do not verify proper release
of not Manila's resources and do not want to fail on cleanup.

DeploymentSerializers should be treated only as config serializers,
and should not contain logic that is related to tasks and order of
execution.

Right now we are bound to use graph serializer inside deployment serializer
because of current reference architecture.

Also graph will be used as a base for pre/post tasks serialization

Notify script which sets explicit routing for VIP should be used
no matter if virtual_interfaces is defined or not (it was set by
mistake for no virtual_interfaces configurations).

Note that notify script is not invoked when keepalived process itself
terminates. In such case the explicit route for VIP is not removed

When a domain is created, the success or failure of the zone transfer needs
to be considered not just the backend domain creation.

- No longer calls update_status from the create_domain or the
  _periodic_create_domains_that_failed methods.
- Ensure zones that do not transfer are marked as ERROR.
- Some refactoring to remove redundant code.

This commit fixes some issues with the jobs that get run on tempest-lib
commits. First since the install lib from release stuff landed in
devstack there isn't a reason to be running any tempest job that
doesn't install tempest-lib from source. So this patch removes those.
Additionally, this removes the pypy check job because I don't think
there is really an expectation of pypy support.

observer hierarchy

This commit creates the basic observer hierarchy for advanced
services, as part of a multi-step refactoring effort of the L3 agent.

The change set has these modifications:

- Focuses on FWaaS changes for this refactoring.
- Creates a FirewallService instance.
- Loads device driver using the service.
- UT updated to test new methods and refactoring changes.

The next steps (future commit) will be to define handlers for events of
interest for FWaas (moving logic out of the L3 agent).

in which other projects appear to have handled this situation is to
copy the wsgi module into the project. See, for example,

I've done the same thing, and since we already have a wsgi module in

renamed the imports accordingly.

Problem Description =================== The approach of on-boarding new functionality via individual, wsgi-pluggable extensions has been tried in a number of projects. While it does allow a cloud provider to clearly decide what parts of new functionality they wish to enable, it also creates a headache for any clients or other service using Keystone as to what is actually supported in any given installation (at any particular time). Nova has experienced significant issues with this, having many such extensions to its API. It is also not clear from our current extensions model, whether a given extension is stable, experimental, an optional replacement for some core API etc. What is required is a more strict definition of the state of new functionality, while minimizing the confusion this creates in terms of what functionality is actually available. Proposed Change =============== It is proposed that we abandon the current mechanism of extensions in favour of three classes of functionality: * functionality that is stable and part of the Keystone tree * functionality that is experimental, but still part of the Keystone tree * functionality that is out-of-tree, can be loaded as required but no formal support is provided The JSON-Home capability would indicate which category any given bit of functionality was in, and since JSON-Home would be optional for out-of-tree code, the lack of JSON-Home would be taken as indication that it was in that category. All existing contrib contents would be re-classified into one of the first two categories above, with the majority being marked as stable (although we might posible also mark some as deprecated). [HN - the implication of this is that all such contrib items would now automatically be loaded and not dependent on the wisi pipeline settings. Is this OK?] By default, major new functionality that is proposed to be in-tree will start off in experimental status. Typically it would take at minimum of one cycle to transition from experimental to stable, although in special cases this might happened within a cycle. Any new functionality that is proposed as experimental that raises concerns over security would have to have a config switch to disable it (with disabled being the default setting). This requirement would be specified as part of the spec for this new functionality. [HN - might it be hard to have a common view over which bits of functionality might be a security concern? Might we end up with ALL major new functionality requiring a config switch?] [HN - What happens about the extension sql repos? Do we merge these back into the main one?] Alternatives ------------ We keep the current extension mechanism, live with the complexity in the clients, but perhaps enhance the support JSON-Home to allow better detection. Data Model Impact ----------------- No direct data model impact, the decision of whether to store data in existing tables vs new tables would be as it is today. REST API Impact --------------- None, except for the mandating of JSON-Home status attribute. Security Impact --------------- None, other than the issue mentioned over using config to disable new functionality that has security concerns. Notifications Impact -------------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- It would no longer be possible to disable experimental functionality by removing it from the wsgi pipeline. Rather for those items that are judged to have a security impact, a config switch would be used. Developer Impact ---------------- For developers building functionality that is classed as out-of-tree, then they must provide their own hosted environment for the code as well as a delivery mechanism.

This new common utilities module created for being
a front-end API for neutron services to the Barbican
TLS containers API and parsing TLS certificate data.

Includes a Barbican implementation of CertManager.

The CertManager interface exposes the following API:

* store_cert(certificate, private_key, intermediates=None,
  private_key_passphrase=None)
  Stores a TLS Certificate in the active backend.

* get_cert(cert_ref, check_only)
  Returns TLS Certificate data fetched from the active backend.

* delete_cert(cert_ref)
  Deletes the TLS Certificate (or soft-deletes / unregisters,
  depending on the active backend).

The CertParser module exposes the following API:

* validate_cert(certificate, private_key=None,
  private_key_passphrase=None, intermediates=None)
  Validate that the certificate is a valid PEM encoded X509 object.

Adding version 1.3.7

1.3.x angular is needed for Horizon launch instance work.

This was dependent on the following (done):
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/142520/
Xstatic-Angular 1.3.7 includes the following packages:
XStatic-Angular-Cookies
XStatic-Angular-Mock

They can be removed, but this apparently needs to be done
in a multi-step process. The interdependency chain,
(horizon has dependency on the old packages) causes
an integration test to fail. So, if we follow the normal
process, then we have to do it in the following order.
1) The newer pakage has to be added to global requirements
2) a) The new dependency has to be added to Horizon
   b) Old dependencies must be removed from Horizon
3) The older packages must be removed from global requirements
   - change 145096

Note: This patch includes the 1.3.7 dependency update, but
that will be handled by the auto update when global requirements
is merged and this should rebase automatically on top of that.

This commit removes images that are in the repository though
not referenced by any documents.

The steps followed to build this list are as follows:
Get list of images in repo:
find fuel-docs/_images/ -type f|awk -F ""/"" \
{'print $NF'}|sort|uniq>repo-images.txt

Find referenced images in RSTs:
egrep -r "".png|.jpg|.svg"" `find fuel-docs/pages \
-name \*rst -type f`|awk -F ""/"" {'print $NF'}| \
sort|uniq>used-images.txt

Get list of unused images:
comm -2 -3 repo-images.txt used-images.txt>unused-images.txt

Find list of images referenced with wildcard and exclude
those from the list of images to be removed:
grep -r ""_images/"" *|egrep ""\*""

Check for images referenced in _templates and exclude
those as well:
egrep -r "".png|.jpg|.svg"" _templates/*

Adds a YAML file describing all of the projects that live in the
openstack/ code namespace. The description of projects is done according
to a set of fields that are documented and defined in a JSONSchema
document project-schema.json. The fields describing the projects
correspond to what I feel are useful for governance purposes, as well as
for end users and operators.

The impetus for this approach is described in this blog post:

http://www.joinfu.com/2014/09/so-what-is-the-core-of-openstack/

Note that the four release models that are used in the project
JSONSchema:

- coordinated-managed
- coordinated
- compatible
- rolling

Correspond to Thierry's excellent description of the various release
models from the comments on review #125786.

The functional test job of some openstack projects (e.g. neutron) uses devstack
to set up the environment for the functional tests. This currently involves
running devstack to get the service installed, and then running unstack because
the tests do not want the service actually running.

Thus it would be convenient if we had a way to tell devstack to stop after
installing the enabled services, and not actually start them.

We add a configuration option START_OPENSTACK_SERVICES which defaults to True
to preserve existing behavior. Setting this option to False will prevent
OpenStack services from starting.

Re-organize some config_, init_, and start_ functions to simplify the flow
where the option is checked. Also add a post-start phase for services, called
""commission_"" where setting up of resources is done by some services.

Problem description =================== Support for ssh access to VMs in tempest tests is both heterogeneous as well as incomplete. Heterogeneous because not all tests honour the same config options. The existing run_ssh option is only taken into account by some of the tests, notably not by the most recent Neutron tests. Incomplete because ssh access is only available to a very limited number of cloud configuration: - access to the ""fixed"" IP address is only available with nova networking, and in case of single server deployment (e.g. tempest running against devstack single-node cloud) - authentication via password is only available if the hypervisor supports password injection (e.g. XEN, but not libvirt) - firewall rules won't block ssh traffic to the VM only as long as nova or neutron are configured with allow-all by default It's also incomplete because the ssh verification utility do not provide enough granularity and debugging option to troubleshoot issues wish ssh to VMs. Proposed change =============== Two new configuration flags are introduced, that allow defining the connection method and the authentication strategy. Extract from the generated tempest.conf.sample: :: # Auth method used for authenticate to the instance.

When we were in the process of working on brick libs
we did quite a bit of funky stuff with setting a member
variable for each class to point to an executor that was
passed in during init.

There's no longer any reason to do this with the target drivers,
so we should simplify our lives a bit and go back to using the
good old cinder.utils wrapper.

It's also believed that the use of the member variable is
susceptible to some concurrency issue that was causing the
wrong cmd string to be executed.  We'll mark this as closing
that bug and reopen if we still see the signature in Kibana.
