sync_routers can take a long time to process, causing
the L3 agent RPC call to time out and retry. Meanwhile
the first message is still being processed, causing
increased load on the server, an endless loop and a cascading
failure.

We can deal with this issue by:
1) Optimizing the message processing on the server
2) Having the agent paginate the request
3) Increasing the timeout

This patch suggests that we should do all three.

Now we have logic in api sample base class is to update the
api version in links for sample file data. So that single set
of sample files works for all tests scenario(v2, v2.1, v2 comp and
microversion etc).

There are some cases where we do not need to update the links.
Example-
'Version' API tests does not run on particular endpoint and
there we need to skip the links update logic.

This patch provides options for tests to update the links or not.

The plan includes the collection of several resource utilization metrics, which will be used to analyze and understand the overall performance of each system. In particular, resource bottlenecks will either be fixed, or best practices developed for system configuration and hardware requirements. List of performance metrics --------------------------- The table below shows the list of test metrics to be collected. The priority is the relative ranking of the importance of each metric in evaluating the performance of the system. +----------+--------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | Priority | Parameter | Description | +==========+==============+====================================================+ | | | The elapsed time to provision all nodes, as a | | 1 | TIME(NODES) | function of the numbers of nodes | | | | | +----------+--------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | | | Network bandwidth as a function of the number of | | 2 | NET(NODES) | nodes. Average during provisioning on the host | | | | where the provisioning system is installed. | +----------+--------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | | | CPU utilization as a function of the number of | | 3 | CPU(NODES) | nodes. Average during provisioning on the host | | | | where the provisioning system is installed. | +----------+--------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | | | Active memory usage as a function of the number of | | 3 | RAM(NODES) | nodes. Average during provisioning on the host | | | | where the provisioning system is installed. | +----------+--------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | | | Storage IO bandwidth as a function of the number of| | 3 | IO(NODES) | nodes. Average during provisioning on the host | | | | where the provisioning system is installed. | +----------+--------------+----------------------------------------------------+ Test Plan --------- The above performance metrics will be measured for various number of provisioned nodes. The result will be a table that shows the dependence of these metrics on the number of nodes. Preparation ^^^^^^^^^^^ 1. The following package needs to be installed on the provisioning system servers. * `dstat` Measuring performance values ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The script `Full script for measuring performance parameters`_ can be used for the first five of the following steps. 1. Start the collection of CPU, memory, network, and storage metrics during the provisioning process. Use the dstat programm which can collect all of these metrics in CSV format into a log file. 2. Start the provisioning process for the first node and record the wall time. 3. Wait until the provisioning process has finished (when all nodes are reachable via ssh) and record the wall time. 4. Stop the dstat program. 5. Prepare collected data for analysis. dstat provides a large amount of information, which can be pruned by saving only the following: * ""system""[time]. Save as given. * 100-""total cpu usage""[idl]. Dstat provides only the idle CPU value. CPU utilization is calculated by subtracting the idle value from 100%. * ""memory usage""[used]/1048576. dstat provides this value in Bytes. This is converted it to Megabytes by dividing by 1024*1024=1048576. * ""net/eth0""[recv]+""net/eth0""[send]. The total receive and transmit bandwidth on the NIC. dstat provides these values in Bytes per second. They are converted to Megabits per second by dividing by 1024*1024/8=131072. * ""io/total""[read]+""io/total""[writ]. The total read and write storage IO bandwidth. These values will be graphed and maximum values reported. 6. Repeat steps 1-5 for provisioning at the same time the following number of nodes: * 10 nodes * 20 nodes * 40 nodes * 80 nodes * 160 nodes * 320 nodes * 640 nodes * 1280 nodes * 2000 nodes Additional tests will be performed if some anomolous behaviour is found. These may require the collection of additional performance metrics. 7. The result of this part of test will be to fill in the following table: +-------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+ | nodes | provisioning | maximum CPU | maximum RAM | maximum NET | maximum IO | | count | time | usage | usage | usage | usage | +=======+==============+=============+=============+=============+============+ | 10 | | | | | | +-------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+ | 20 | | | | | | +-------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+ | 40 | | | | | | +-------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+ | 80 | | | | | | +-------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+ | 160 | | | | | | +-------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+ | 320 | | | | | | +-------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+ | 640 | | | | | | +-------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+ | 1280 | | | | | | +-------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+ | 2000 | | | | | | +-------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+ Applications ------------ Full script for measuring performance parameters ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ .. literalinclude:: measure.sh :language: bash ",,231,0

We have a ""skipfuelmenu"" variable in virtualbox scripts, which allows to
skip ""fuelmenu"" step during the installation procedure. This option is
enabled by default.

Currently, we have a hardcoded variable $boot_line, which contains scan
codes, passed by VirtualBox into isolinux on an emulated keyboard.

We should generate these scancodes from a user specified line instead of
hardcoding them.

Add gate test for python-fuelclient that should be executed
for each review in openstack/python-fuelclient repo.

Next variables should be exported:
UPDATE_FUEL=true
UPDATE_FUEL_PATH=/path/to/source

Test depends on ready_with_1_slaves,
so it is better to run it with -k option.

Scenario:
 1. Revert snapshot 'ready_with_1_slave'
 2. Apply changes from review
 3. Bootstrap 1 node
 4. Show  releases list
 5. Create cluster over cli
 6. Update networks
 7. Update SSL settings
 8. List environments
 9. Add and provision 1 node with controller role
 10. Deploy node
 11. Delete cluster

We're still failing occassionally; data tells us that when we get a slow
host, it's failing during boot on the last cleaning phase.

We have found that it's mostly userspace taking so long at boot, so
we're going down the path of making that faster.

Bump the timeout while we work on that.

Manila microversions have following template:

x.y

where 'x' and 'y' both digits.

And now tempest transforms string 'x.y' to float but it is incorrect
thing to do because float assumes that each left value is bigger than
right one. And it is not suitable for microversion comparisons.

Examples:

Microversions true conditions:
2.9 < 2.10
2.9 < 2.81

Float true conditions:
2.9 > 2.10
2.9 > 2.81

So, create new file 'manila_tempest_tests/utils.py' and place there
old and new functions that serve all microversion actions. In addition,
port another existing utility function called 'rand_ip'.

all its public methods will be decorated again and again
that can lead to the RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded.
This situation may be easilly reached in case if trace_cls

This solution based on idea that user already has configured permissions for users and this configuration is stored in OpenLDAP or Active Directory. The oslo.policy should be able to read permissions not only from policy.json file but also from OpenLDAP/AD. Problem description =================== Currently oslo.policy can read permissions only from policy.json. In real world if user uses OpenLDAP/AD it usually means that there is already configured permissions for users. In this case user has to reconfigure permissions by using policy.json file and support at least 2 sources for permissions. Proposed change =============== description of idea ------------------- Implementation of this solution assumes that user already has user permissions in OpenLDAP/AD. Permission is which ROLE can do OPERATION with OBJECT. OpenLDAP/AD should have schema to store Users, Roles and Permissions. LDAP Tree should look like this: People --> test_user Roles --> admin ...Performers: test_user Permissions --> rbacObjectNm=identity --> rbacOperationNm=list_users ...rbacRls: admin Simple example of schema in OpenLDAP: USER uid=test_user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com ROLE rbacRoleNm=admin,ou=Roles,dc=example,dc=com objectClass: organizationalRole (structural) objectClass: rbacRole (structural) objectClass: top (abstract) cn: admin rbacRoleNm: admin Performers: test_user Performers: test_user_2 OBJECT rbacObjectNm=identity,ou=Permissions,dc=example,dc=com OPERATION rbacOperationNm=list_users,rbacObjectNm=identity, ou=Permissions,dc=example,dc=com objectClass: organizationalRole (structural) objectClass: rbacOperation (structural) objectClass: top (abstract) cn: identity.list_users rbacObjectNm: identity rbacOperationNm: list_users rbacPermissionNm: identity.list_users rbacRls: admin Steps to check user permission: 1. Get by search operation rbacRls attribute values for object and operation. 2. Get by search operation Performers attribute values for role. 3. Check if user is in a list of performers. changes ------- To implement this approach following changes in oslo.policy should be done: 1. Create BaseEnforcer class. a) BaseEnforcer class is basic implementation for enforcement. b) BaseEnforcer should have *enforce* method. This method should parse arguments and call *enforce_string_rule* method. c) BaseEnforcer shouldn't have implementation of *enforce_string_rule* method. This method should be implemented in inherited from BaseEnforcer classes. 2. class Enforcer should be inherited from BaseEnforcer class. a) Enforcer class should cover case when permissions are stored in policy.json file. b) Enforcer behaviour shouldn't be changed. c) Enforcer should have implementation of *enforce_string_rule* method. d) Method *enforce_string_rule* is just renamed old *enforce* method. 3. Create LDAPEnforcer class with Enforcer as parent. a) LDAPEnforcer class should cover case when permissions are stored in OpenLDAP/AD. b) LDAPEnforcer should have implementation of *enforce_string_rule* method. c) Method *enforce_string_rule* should call LDAPCheck to check permissions. 4. Create class LDAPCheck. a) LDAPCheck class should get permissions for user by LDAP from OpenLDAP/AD and check them. b) LDAPCheck should get OpenLDAP/AD admin login/password and structure of tree from config. c) LDAPCheck should checks permission by using LDAP search. Apache Fortress --------------- The Apache Fortress project provides a full ANSI RBAC compliant management and enforcement system that builds on existing open source applications like ApacheDS, OpenLDAP and Apache Tomcat. Apache Fortress stores all his data in OpenLDAP and structure of tree is the same with previously described structure. It means that this solution work with Apache Fortress. All that should be done - properly set parameters in config file. Drawbacks ========= This solution adds new functional to oslo.policy and doesn't make any changes in old functional. Changes should not affect any components except oslo.policy. oslo.policy should continue work with policy.json without any changes. Alternatives ============ Other solutions requires changes in Keystone.

""admin_user"", ""admin_tenant_name"", ""admin_password"" and ""auth_uri""
are options which are imported from the ""keystone_authtoken"" group,
itself being part of the ""keystonemiddleware"" 3rd-party library.

The problem is that these options are imported at 2 different
locations in the codebase:

- watcher/applier/manager.py
- watcher/common/keystone.py

Removed one from the applier.

instack-virt-setup runs
""tripleo get-vm-mac $UNDERCLOUD_VM_NAME"" to get the
MAC address of the instack.

If multiple vm names contain $UNDERCLOUD_VM_NAME string,
several MACs are returned.

This fix returns mac from only one virtual server.

This change adds a new *_from_pool.yaml meant to return an IP from
a list instead of allocating a Neutron port, useful to pick an IP
from a pre-defined list and making it possible to configure, for
example an external balancer in advance (or dns), with the future

The list of IPs is provided via parameter_defaults (in the

Also some additional VipPort types are created for the *VirtualIP

Something regressed with this because the GMRs that are in

We were trying to validate deprecated neutron properties with
properties.data, which work when you have a reference, but not a
parameter. Instead, compare it None which is what's the value when it's
not set at all.

We can't backport the original patch because it uses the new translation
mechanism for deprecating properties.

NFS: 3PAR NFS shares can only be ro or rw, so create 2 shares
that both point to the same destination with the same export location.
This appears as one share in Manila. Create the RW share when the
share is first created (to make sure it is create-able) and add the
RO version when needed to support an RO access rule.

CIFS: For user access, this is easy. Just set read instead of fullcontrol.
Since 3PAR cannot do read-only at the CIFS IP level and also since most Manila
drivers do not use IP access on CIFS, take out the default requirement
of IP access for CIFS. Add a config setting to allow the old behavior to
be used if needed.

1. Help messages for `rally verify` were reworked for better comprehension.
2. Doc strings for many methods were changed to keep consistency with help
   messages.
3. Missing doc string were added.

In addition, the 'start' method in verify.py was slightly refactored.
Also InvalidArgumentsException was replaced by the print() function
because it is recommended to use print() in CLI module.

Now arguments of the 'verify' method in api.py have the default values to
keep consistency with other methods.

As Doug said in
http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-November/080694.html,
reno setup for libraries is optional for stable/liberty.

python-keystoneclient, keystoneauth, and keystonemiddleware currently
do not handle release notes on stable/liberty, so do not run reno there.

Keep the post job to run on any change. It always checks out master, so
there's no harm running it when liberty changes merge.

We need to test keystone running under eventlet until we can get rid

keystone running under eventlet since a change in other projects

Eventually this will allow changing the gate to run the

Renaming an instance only updates the display_name while the hostname
remains unchanged in the database. Due to this behavior the hostname
will not be updated via rebuilding the instance.

The expected behavior is to update both values when renaming the

When keepalived crashed unexpectedly, the vrrp process that
it associates with will be orphan process. This will make
the VIP unable to migrate to the router in the same host.
Also, neutron code is not able to respawn the keepalived
process, because keepalived thinks itself is still running,

The fernet payload tests assumed that the timestamp string that
was put into the payload would be exactly the same as the timestamp
string resulting from parsing the payload, but this isn't the case
since the timestamp string goes through a conversion to float and
back and a tiny amount of precision may be lost.

The tests are changed to allow a tiny difference in timestamp
strings.

This was causing python3.4 unit tests to fail sometimes.

I consistently have problems building images on an 8 GB VM with
the undercloud already installed (which is the documented flow).
At 4 or 12 GB it works fine, but 8 seems to fall in a sweet spot
where the tmpfs usage of dib causes OOM problems.  4 GB works
because dib doesn't use tmpfs by default with that little memory,
and 12 GB seems to be sufficient to avoid running out of memory
even with tmpfs.

This changes passes the --min-tmpfs 5 parameter to the image build
for the overcloud-full image (the largest image by far) so it will
not attempt to build in tmpfs if there is less than 12 GB of RAM.
5 instead of 6 because due to rounding 6 would result in tmpfs not
being used on 12 GB VMs either (similar to how it is not used on a
4 GB VM even though the default is 2).

Note that tmpfs by default uses half of total memory, which is why
all of the min-tmpfs numbers are half of the expected memory on the
system.

We have added a logic to handle nova-compute failure during
a soft reboot in patch: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/219980
but we have missed to add instance.save() to save the
modified task state, so the logic doesn't work.

This patch adds instance.save() at the end of this handling.

Issues:
- Method `webob.multidict.MultiDict.items` returns list object in py2 env[1]

- Wrong checks for utf-8. (including check for encoding headers names, which
  is not encoded anywhere in the code)
- Wrong checks for `body` property of `webob.response.Response` cls. Method
  `_body__get` returns bytes[3]. There is no problem in python 2, since

The managers have a bad habit of reaching back into the client and
making assumptions about the values that are saved there. These
assumptions are not always correct when we use the session object.

Test all the versioned managers against a client that was constructed
with the old method and with a keystoneclient session object and a
keystoneauth1 session object.

All instance files will be retained in the instance store backed by NFS on the compute node when an instance is shelved. Problem description =================== When you unshelve hundreds of instances at the same time, instance spawning time varies and it mainly depends on the size of the instance snapshot and the network speed between glance and nova servers. If you have configured file store (NFS) as a backend in Glance for storing images/snapshots, then it’s possible to improve the performance of unshelve instance dramatically by configuring nova.image.download.FileTransfer in nova. In this case, it simply copies the instance snapshot as if it is stored on the local filesystem of the compute node. But then again in this case, it is observed the network traffic increases enormously between NFS servers and nova resulting in slow spawning of the instances. Use Cases ---------- Unshelve hundreds of instances in minimal time. Project Priority ----------------- High Proposed change =============== NFS will be used for storing instance files on the compute nodes. An existing configuration parameter “shelved_offload_time"" will be used here to indicate the instance files shouldn’t be deleted. -1, never offload (CPU/Memory/Disks resources are not released) 0, offload when shelved (CPU/Memory/Disks resources are not released) > 0, offload using “_poll_shelved_instances” periodic task (CPU/Memory/Disks resources are not released) New value will be added -2, offload partially, release CPU/Memory but retain instance files Note: In case shelved_offload_time=-2, you must configure instance path (instances_path parameter) on NFS on all of the compute nodes. A new VM state 'SHELVED_PARTIAL_OFFLOADED' and new Task state 'SHELVING_PARTIAL_OFFLOADING' will be added. Shelve api call: * shelved_host (host where the instance is running) will be set to instance_system_metadata. * Instance snapshot will be taken and stored in glance. * Disk resources (instance files) will not be destroyed (self.driver.destroy(…,destroy_disks=False). * CPU/Memory will be released. * Instance host and node will be set to None. * VM state will be set to SHELVED_PARTIAL_OFFLOADED. * Quotas will not be released, similar to shelve/shelve_offloaded case. Unshelve api call: * Select a new compute node (nova-scheduler) from the available pool of compute nodes * Set the newly elected host to the instance and call start_instance method (hard reboot). In this case, it will use the already existing instance files as it is without the need of downloading/copying instance snapshot from the glance server. * VM state will be set to ACTIVE. * Quotas will not be touched. Deleting instance in shelve_partial_offload state: * Instance host stored in the 'shelved_host' from instance system_metadata will be retrieved and assign to the instance. * Instance will be destroyed from the shelved host. It will ensure instance files are deleted properly. * Quotas will be released in the normal workflow. Advantages: * Improve unshelve instance performance as it completely eliminates the need of downloading/copying instance snapshot from glance * Unshelve instance performance will not be impacted by any kind of backed store configured in glance. * CPU/Memory released after shelving instances will allow nova scheduler to use the compute capacity for launching new instances (similar to shelve_offload case). Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- New notification 'shelve_partial_offload.start' and 'shelve_partial_offload.end' will be added. Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ Unshelve instance performance will be improved in case instance files are stored on NFS on the compute nodes. Other deployer impact --------------------- An existing configuration parameter “shelved_offload_time"" will be modified here to indicate the instance files shouldn’t be deleted. -1, never offload 0, offload when shelved > 0, offload using “_poll_shelved_instances” periodic task New value will be added -2, offload partially, release CPU/Memory but retain instance files Note: In case shelved_offload_time=-2, you must configure instance path (instances_path parameter) on NFS on all of the compute nodes.

A net-list operation was calling extend_network_dict_provider for
each network individually which would result in a database call for
each network.

This adds a new call in the manager to extend multiple networks at
once and then it adds a bulk version of get_network_segments that
it calls.

Now 1 net list of any number of networks will only result in 1
segment DB call.

Currently a HTTP_REFERER (Referer) header isn't passed down to
subrequests. This means *LO subrequests to segment containers
return a 403 on a *LO GET when accessed by requests using referer
ACLs.
Currently the only way around referer access to *LO's is to make the
segments container world readable.

This change makes sure the referer header is passed into subrequests
allowing a segments container to only need to be locked down with
the same referer as the *LO container.

This is a 1 line change to code, but also adds a unit and 2 functional
functional tests (one for DLO and one for SLO).

The connection_data dict can have credentials in it, so we need to scrub
those before putting the stringified dict into the StorageError message
and raising that up and when logging the dict.

Note that strutils.mask_password converts the dict to a string using
six.text_type so we don't have to do that conversion first.

(Both of these patches have to be merged at the same time, because
there are multiple upstream contract breaks affecting us at the same
time)

Item #1:

Remove SQLite BigInteger/Integer translation logic

This patch removes code that was causing the
SQLAlchemy BigInteger type to render as INTEGER
on the SQLite backend only.  The comment
in create_shadow_table() in nova/db/sqlalchemy/utils.py
which states that BigInteger isn't supported by SQLite
is not correct.  SQLite has an ""affinity""-based,
dynamic typing model [1] that allows virtually any
name to be used for a type; datatypes are actually
determined on a row-by-row basis, but any
type name that has the substring INT inside of it
is automatically given integer affinity by default,
so there is no limitation on this type.

There is one difference on SQLite between INTEGER
and BIGINT, and that is that SQLite's ""rowid""
feature only takes effect for a primary key column
if it is named ""INTEGER PRIMARY KEY"" [2].  However,
as all tests pass here it does not seem to be the
case that we are using BigInteger primary keys
in tests, and if we were, I'd rather approach SQLite's
quirk here in a different way.

Note that this patch relies upon the assumption
that **SQLite is only used in Nova as a test database,
not in actual deployments**.  If this statement is
not true, then information on these other use cases
will be needed.

Due to Alembic issue #341 [3] which has been resolved
for version 0.8.4 [4], the comparison of
INTEGER/BIGINT/SMALLINT is now significant by default,
so this change (or alternatively, one that changes Nova's
type comparison rules within migration tests) is needed
in order for Nova to pass the test_migrations test; the
error condition that raises with the latest Alembic is
shown in [5].

If the processor model name contains the ""processor"" keyword,
get_number_of_vcpus() will report from vcpus count.

This change makes sure get_number_of_vcpus() only matches lines starting with
the ""processor"" keyword so it doesn't match model name with said keyword.

This introduces a base live migration data object and makes compute
manager convert any migrate data objects received from the driver
back to dicts. This is transitional as we build support for using
these objects, as well as infrastructure around handling the
conversion to them over the next RPC major version.

The goal here will be to unify all of the random dicts that we pass
around between live migration steps with one type of object (which
will be subclassed per driver). Right now, we have dest_check_data,
migrate_data, and pre_live_migration_result which are all weird
semi-overlapping versions of each other. But, in order to this in
a graceful way, we need to support generating the old dict format,
which is even weirder when it comes from something uniform. Hang on,
it's going to be a bumpy ride, but better in the long run.

In this patch, we're setting the stage for per-driver conversions to
come afterwards. This converts the hyperv driver in-place, because
it's trivial.

This's a regression issue introduced by

I4f2f2f240404b2619ba0ee75a99fecd0ad10040e

Though we support lazy creation for queue, but it doesn't make
sense there's no result after creating the queue explicitly from cli.
So this patch introduces a new parameter named force_create to make
sure make sure the queue create is called each time when it's called
from command line interface.

It is used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in RAM to reduce the number of times an external data source must be read. Memcached is a memory cache demon that can be used by most OpenStack services to store ephemeral data, such as tokens. Access to memcached is not handled by HAproxy because replicated access is currently only in an experimental state. Instead OpenStack services must be supplied with the full list of hosts running memcached. The Memcached client implements hashing to balance objects among the instances. Failure of an instance only impacts a percentage of the objects and the client automatically removes it from the list of instances. The SLA is several minutes. ",,22,15

For more comfortable testing Sahara in MOS need to move tests to separate repository. Problem description =================== Not quite right test tool in Sahara repository, Proposed change =============== First it's proposed to discuss how correctly install scenario tests after moving to new repository, correctly installing requirements for tests. Then after the founded resolution of problems we can create a new repository and move all sahara tests. After that need migrate all sahara-ci jobs to new source for sahara tests. Also, need implement CI for testing several sahara previous releases using scenario tests. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Deployer impact --------------- Deployers should switch CI to use new repository of scenario tests instead of current sahara repository. Developer impact ---------------- None Sahara-image-elements impact ---------------------------- None Sahara-dashboard / Horizon impact --------------------------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: esikachev Work Items ---------- This will require following changes: * Discuss the script to install scenario tests. * Move tests to separate repository (with unit tests). * Update sahara-ci jobs for new scenario tests repository. * Add new jobs on sahara-ci for testing sahara on previous releases. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= None Documentation Impact ==================== Need to add documentation with description ""How to run Sahara scenario tests"".

HAProxy the load balances incoming requests and exposes just one IP address for all the clients. Galera synchronous replication guarantees a zero slave lag. The failover procedure completes once HAProxy detects that the active back end has gone down and switches to the backup one, which is then marked as 'UP'. If no back ends are up (in other words, the Galera cluster is not ready to accept connections), the failover procedure finishes only when the Galera cluster has been successfully reassembled. The SLA is normally no more than 5 minutes. - Use MySQL/Galera in active/passive mode to avoid deadlocks on ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` type queries (used, for example, by nova and neutron).

The application layer is controlled by the ``oslo.messaging`` configuration options for multiple AMQP hosts. If the AMQP node fails, the application reconnects to the next one configured within the specified reconnect interval. The specified reconnect interval constitutes its SLA. On the infrastructure layer, the SLA is the time for which RabbitMQ cluster reassembles. Several cases are possible. The Mnesia keeper node is the master of the corresponding Pacemaker resource for RabbitMQ; when it fails, the result is a full AMQP cluster downtime interval. Normally, its SLA is no more than several minutes. Failure of another node that is a slave of the corresponding Pacemaker resource for RabbitMQ results in no AMQP cluster downtime at all. ",18,23

Each instance of HAProxy configures its frontend to accept connections only from the virtual IP (VIP) address and to terminate them as a list of all instances of the corresponding service under load balancing. For example, any OpenStack API service. This makes the instances of HAProxy act independently and fail over transparently together with the Network endpoints (VIP addresses) failover and shares the same SLA.

Gerrit 2.11 no longer seems to support the sortKey method of
skipping changes.  Instead is provides a --start option that takes
a number of changes to skip.

See: https://review.openstack.org/Documentation/cmd-query.html

In addition, this required a change to the format of the changes
dict.  It turns out we were overwriting some changes if two had the
same id.  This is common in stable branch cherry picks.

In order to avoid this, I used a tuple of id, project, branch
as the key for the changes dict.  This does break compatibility
with existing cache files, so a check was added to clear old
caches.

Both of these changes were required together because otherwise we
end up with a smaller number of items in changes than we should
have, and the --start argument is incorrect so we start double
processing changes, which breaks the loop because it looks like
the change was already cached.

Change Ib60d60a5af35be89ad8afbcf44fcffe0b0ce2876 meant
to address a race in deleting an instance while booting from
volume such that the BDMs passed to terminate_instance from
the API were stale (no volume_id set yet in the database).

Without the volume_id, _shutdown_instance can't detach the
volumes and _cleanup_volumes can't delete them.

The change fixed the race in _shutdown_instance by refreshing
the BDM list if necessary, but it didn't fix the problem of
deleting the volumes in _cleanup_volumes, which is still
getting a stale list of BDMs from the compute API.

This moves the refresh BDM logic to the top-level method
terminate_instance so that the refreshed BDMs are passed
to both _shutdown_instance and _cleanup_volumes.

There is some cleanup that can be done with
_delete_instance but since we'd like to backport this change
and the previous one, the cleanup is left for a later patch.

Find out more `here <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/>`_. What are DevStack plugins? -------------------------- DevStack plugins act as project specific extensions of DevStack . They allow external projects to execute code directly in the DevStack run, supporting configuration and installation changes as part of the normal local.conf and stack.sh execution. For NovaLink, we have DevStack plugins for each of our three projects - nova-powervm, networking-powervm, and ceilometer-powervm. These plugins, with the appropriate local.conf settings for your environment, will allow you to simply clone down DevStack, configure, run stack.sh, and end up with a working OpenStack/Novalink PowerVM environment with no other scripting required. More details can be `found here. <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/plugins.html>`_ How to use the NovaLink DevStack plugins: ----------------------------------------- 2. Set up your local.conf file to pull in our projects: 1. If you have an existing DevStack local.conf, modify it to to pull in this project by adding:: [[local|localrc]] enable_plugin nova-powervm http://git.openstack.org/openstack/nova-powervm and following the instructions for networking-powervm and ceilometer-powervm as needed for your environment. 2. If you're setting up DevStack for the first time, example files are available in the nova-powervm project to provide reference on using this driver with the corresponding networking-powervm and ceilometer-powervm drivers. Following these example files will enable the appropriate drivers and services for each node type. Example config files for all-in-one, compute, and control nodes `can be found here. <https://github.com/openstack/nova-powervm/tree/master/devstack>`_ 3. See our devrefs and plugin references for the configuration options for each driver, * nova-powervm * http://nova-powervm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/devref/index.html * https://github.com/openstack/nova-powervm/blob/master/devstack/README.rst * networking-powervm * http://docs.openstack.org/developer/networking-powervm/devref/index.html * https://github.com/openstack/networking-powervm/blob/master/devstack/README.rst * ceilometer-powervm * http://ceilometer-powervm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/devref/index.html * https://github.com/openstack/ceilometer-powervm/blob/master/devstack/README.rst 4. For nova-powervm, changing the DISK_DRIVER settings for your environment will be required. The default configuration for other settings will be sufficient for most installs. :: [[local|localrc]] ... DISK_DRIVER = VOL_GRP_NAME = CLUSTER_NAME = [[post-config|$NOVA_CONF]] [powervm]5. A few notes: * By default this will pull in the latest/trunk versions of all the projects. If you want to run a stable version instead, you can either check out that stable branch in the DevStack repo (git checkout stable/liberty) which is the preferred method, or you can do it on a project by project basis in the local.conf file as needed. * If you need any special services enabled for your environment, you can also specify those in your local.conf file. In our example files we demonstrate enabling and disabling services (n-cpu, q-agt, etc) required for our drivers. 5. Run ``stack.sh`` from DevStack:: $ FORCE=yes ./stack.sh FORCE=yes is needed on Ubuntu 15.10 since only Ubuntu LTS releases are officially supported by DevStack. If you're running a control only node on a different, supported OS version you can skip using FORCE=yes. 6. At this point DevStack will run through stack.sh, and barring any DevStack issues, you should end up with a standard link to your Horizon portal at the end of the stack run.

Currently logging configuration is splitted in two distinct classes,
the api.pp and the logging.pp classes. This review aims to centralize
all logging related parameters in a single class, the logging.pp one.

The impacted parameters are :

* use_syslog
* use_stderr
* log_facility
* verbose
* debug
* log_dir
* log_file

This change remains backward compatible with what is currently in place.

Per discussion on the mailing list [1] and the related
nova specification [2] it has been decided that the
signature should be of the image data directly, rather
than of the glance MD5 ""checksum"" hash of the image
data.

This spec updates the prior approved and implemented
Liberty spec with these modifications.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================================== Glance Image Signing and Verification ===================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/glance/+spec/image-signing-and-verification-support OpenStack currently does not support the following feature: * Signature validation of uploaded signed images Deploying authentication will protect image integrity by verifying that an image has not been modified after the upload by the user. This feature improves the enterprise-ready posture of OpenStack. Problem description =================== There is no method for users to verify that a previously uploaded image has not been modified. An image could potentially be modified in transit (such as when it is uploaded to Glance or transferred to Nova) or Glance itself could be untrusted and modify images without a user's knowledge. An image that is modified could include malicious code. Providing support for image signatures and signature verification would allow the user to verify that an image has not been modified prior to booting the image. There are several use cases that this feature will support: * An image is signed by an End User, using the user's private key. The user then uploads the image to Glance, along with the signature created and a reference to the user's public key certificate. Glance uses this information to verify that the signature is valid, and notifies the user if the signature is invalid. * An image is created in Nova, and Nova signs the image at the request of the End User. When the image is uploaded to Glance, the signature and public key certificate reference are also provided. Glance verifies the signature before storing the image, and notifies Nova if the signature verification fails. * A signed image is requested by Nova, and Glance provides the signature and a reference to the public key certificate to Nova along with the image so that Nova can verify the signature before booting the image. Proposed change =============== For the initial implementation, this change will use the property feature of Glance to store the metadata items needed for image signing and verification. These include a public key certificate reference, and the signature. These are provided when the image is created, and are accessible when the image is uploaded. Note that this proposed change will only support image uploads with the Glance API v2 (and will not support using the Glance API v1). Also note that multiple formats for the key (such as SubjectPublicKeyInfo) and for the signature (such as PSS) will be supported. The format of the signature will be stored as one of the properties. The certificate reference will be used to access the certificate from a key manager, where the certificate will be stored. This certificate is added to the key manager by the end user before uploading the image. Note that the signature is done offline. Glance already supports computing checksums of images when an image is uploaded, and this checksum is stored with the image. This same hash (which by default is MD5) will be used for the signature verification. The checksum hash is computed in glance_store (when the image data is uploaded), and is then used to verify the signature. The Glance frontend should use the reference to the public key certificate to retrieve the certificate from the key manager, and then use this public key along with the signature, the computed checksum, and the rest of the signature metadata to verify the signature. If the signature verification fails, the image will transition to a killed state, and the user will be notified that the upload failed and given a reason why. Alternatives ------------ An alternative to using the hash already created in the store backend for the signature verification/creation is to compute a hash in the store frontend. However, eventlet.wsgi.Input file-like object that represents the image data can only be read once, and needs to be read in the store backend in order to upload the image. In order to read the image data in the Glance frontend, Glance could copy the data into a file, use the file to verify/create the signature, and then give this file to the store backend to upload. This would be similar to what is done with the S3 backend [1]. However, this approach would take significantly more time (during image upload), and there would not be much gained. An alternative to storing a reference to the public key certificate in Glance would be to store the actual public key certificate in Glance. However, this approach would be insecure, since Glance, unlike a dedicated key manager, has not been created with storing keys or certificates in mind. An alternative to using asymmetric keys for integrity and confidentiality is to use symmetric keys. However, in order for Glance to be able to verify the image, it would need to have access to the key used to create the signature. This access would enable Glance to modify the image and create a new signature without the user's knowledge. Using asymmetric keys enables Glance to verify the signature without giving Glance the power to modify the image and signature. An alternative to using the Glance properties to store and retrieve the signature metadata would be to create an API extension that support signatures. Then, instead of the user setting the metadata using the property key value pairs, the API extension would be used. Currently, if a user were to use the metadata keys (for the certificate and signature) for other purposes, the image uploads would fail. Another item of note is that an API extension would allow for the management of multiple signatures per image in a clean manner, which is not possible with the properties approach. However, the Images API does not support extensions, so this is not a valid approach. Another alternative to using the Glance properties to store and retrieve the signature metadata would be to use the CMS (cryptographic message syntax) format as defined in RFC 5652 Section 5. However, the size for this would be variable, and could not use the existing Glance properties, which would require API modifications. For the initial implementation, Glance properties will be used, with the plan to migrate to using CMS in a future implementation as the need for increased flexibility arises. An alternative to requiring the user to provide the signature separate from the image is to support images that already have an embedded signature. Although this could be included as a future improvement, the initial implementation will not provide embedded signature support, since it is advantageous to keep the initial effort focused and small. An alternative to using the existing MD5 hash algorithm is to create a separate configurable hash for use with verifying/creating the signature. However, creating a separate hash negatively affects the performance, without providing much benefit. Note that since there are preferable hash algorithms to MD5 that are more secure, a separate change is being proposed to allow for the configuring of this hash algorithm [2]. This will not be included as a part of this change, in the interest of having a straightforward initial implementation. An alternative to focusing on a single-cloud implementation would be to include support for multi-clouds in the initial implementation. If images are exchanged between different clouds, signature verification could be used to confirm that images have not be modified. However, in the interest of a more simplistic initial implementation, explicit support for multi-clouds will be saved for future iterations. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- No API changes will be needed for the initial implementation, provided that other services are able to retrieve all of the properties of a given image. Note that the existing API allows for providing the signature metadata as Glance properties, and returning an error message if verification fails. Security impact --------------- This change improves the enterprise-ready posture of OpenStack by enabling signature signing and verification. Although keys are used in this change, the keys themselves are assumed to be stored in a key manager, and only a reference to the certificate is stored in Glance. This change involves hashing the image data for use in verifying and creating signatures for the image. Note that the signature length is currently limited to 255 bytes, since this is the maximum size supported for Glance properties. In turn, this limits the size of the keys that can be used for signature creation. Notifications impact -------------------- This change will involve adding log messages to indicate the success or failure of signature verification and creation. Other end user impact --------------------- The user will be required to provide the appropriate information needed for the signing and verification in order to use this feature. There are no changes that need to be made to python-glanceclient. Performance Impact ------------------ The feature will only be used if a user has provided the appropriate properties during the image upload. Otherwise, no signature verification or creation will occur. When signature verification and creation do occur, there will be some latency associated with retrieving the certificate from the key manager. Since the hash is already being created for images, the hash creation has no impact to performance. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: brianna-poulos Other contributors: dane-fichter Reviewers --------- Core reviewer(s): flaper87 sigmavirus24 nikhil_k Other reviewer(s): joel-coffman Work Items ---------- The feature will be tackled in the following stages: 1. Enable Glance to verify signatures provided by the user during an image upload initiated by the user. 2. Enable Glance to verify signatures provided by Nova during an image upload of a snapshot taken by Nova. Dependencies ============ The cryptography library, which will be used for hash creation and signature verification and creation, is already a part of the global-requirements of OpenStack. However, it is not a part of Glance, and will need to be added there. Glance currently does not interact with any key managers. Since a key manager is needed to manage the keys, changes will need to be made to allow Glance to retrieve the public key certificate using a key manager. Specifically, Castellan [3] will be used to interface with the key manager chosen. The initial key manager will be Barbican, but Castellan can be configured to use a different backend. In order to take advantage of the signatures in Glance, Nova will need to be updated to retrieve the signatures from Glance and verify them. However, Glance does not depend on Nova to have this support in order to have the feature added. The spec for this in Nova [4] has not yet been approved. Testing ======= Before Nova support for this feature is added, unit tests will be sufficient. Once Nova support is added, Tempest tests should ensure that the interaction between Nova and Glance works as expected. Documentation Impact ==================== Instructions for how to use the change will need to be documented. These include instructions for the user on how to create keys and signatures offline before providing this information during the creation of an image. This documentation will also include descriptions for each of the following signature metadata properties: * signature: the signature of the ""checksum hash"" encoded in base64 format * signature_hash_method: the hash method used to create the signature * signature_key_type: the key type used in creating the signature - valid values are: ""RSA-PSS"" * signature_certificate_uuid: the uuid used to retrieve the certificate from castellan * mask_gen_algorithm: only used for RSA-PSS, defines the mask generation algorithm used in the signature generation, optional and defaults to ""MGF1"" - valid values are: ""MGF1"" * pss_salt_length: only used for RSA-PSS, defines the salt length used in the signature generation, optional and defaults to PSS.MAX_LENGTH References ========== cryptography: https://cryptography.io/en/latest/ [1] http://goo.gl/Y3u3lK [2] https://review.openstack.org/191542 [3] http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/castellan [4] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/188874/ ",,319,0

In an effort to widen support for resource properties that are IDs but
can take the appropriate resource type for that ID, the block_store
service throws a kink into it. The Volume type can contain a Snapshot,
and a Snapshot can contain a Volume. Because of that loop, we can't do
the usual `foo = resource.prop(foo, FooType)`. We can sort of emulate
the behavior users will get out of it in the proxy by doing a type
conversion in the create_volume and create_snapshot methods to support
resource instances being passed in there.

Additionally, Volume can be created from another Volume, but we can't
have a prop refer to its own class, so that problem is solved the same
as above.

Lastly, the Volume resource has two props that can take real types:
image and type.

Problem description =================== We supported multiple storage drivers(habase, mongodb, sqlalchemy) in Ceilometer, that is main for the recording/query performance based massive metric data. Aodh continue those drivers after alarming service splitting, but Aodh only have alarm related data which unlikely be a large number and the sql can well meet the requirement. Most of other projects in OpenStack only use sql as database. So we don't need to keep the hbase and mongodb support in Aodh. The advantages of removing the hbase and mongodb support are: * make the code of Aodh more clean that reduce the maintenance works of storage drivers and related tests. * focus on the functionality and avoid considering multiple drivers support if new features coming. Proposed change =============== * remove the mongodb storage implementation * remove the hbase storage implementation * remove the mongodb and hbase related tests * remove the gate jobs based on mongodb and hbase Alternatives ------------ None.

neutron-server-start-wait-stop is a dangerous Exec that is exposed to
race conditions, because it does not have ""onlyif"" or ""unless""
statements.

That means during a deployment, this exec can be run in the wrong order
during Step 5 and/or 6, while it was supposed to be run at Step 4 only.
If that happens, the exec will fail because puppet tries to start
neutron-server while Pacemaker already started the resource. So in that
case, systemd would returns 1 to Puppet which would return 6 to the
overcloud deployment and the deployment would fail to finish correctly.

This patch aims to prevent from this scenario by making sure we run the
exec only during the step 4.

Also, in order to secure it a bit more, we add 'unless' statement to
this exec, so we would make sure the Puppet run would be idempotent and
the Exec would run one successful time only.

We already use this pattern in places where we need to keep backwards
compatibility with an older RPC client that may not be sending the
migration object over.

Instead of it being a repetitive check, we make it a static
method on the ComputeManager class, and document that it can be removed
with the next major compute RPC version bump, in a single place instead
of a random comment.

This filter is best explained by the doc string in the module:

""""""
Flavor classes are defined by setting the 'class' key on a flavor's
extra_specs (instance_type['extra_specs']['class']).

Cells can announce that they only support certain flavor classes by setting
the 'capabilities' nova.conf option under the [cells] config section.  The
value of this option should be 'flavor_classes=name1;name2;name3' to
advertise that they support flavor classes 'name1', 'name2', and 'name3'.

Imagine this configuration:

flavor #1 extra_specs['class'] = 'highio'
flavor #2 extra_specs['class'] = 'standard'

Cell #1 nova.conf:

------- 8< -------
[cells]
enable=true
name=cell1
capabilities=flavor_classes=highio;some_other_class,some_other_cap=abc
------- 8< -------

Cell #2 nova.conf:

------- 8< -------
[cells]
enable=true
name=cell2
capabilities=flavor_classes=standard;some_other_class,some_other_cap=abc
------- 8< -------

Note the capabilities syntax:
 * '=' to match each key=val pair in a single capability
 * ','  to separate capabilities
 * ';' to separate the list of capability values

With this filter, building flavor #1 will go to cell1.  Flavor #2 will go
to cell2.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================================== Support long-running deploy ramdisks ==================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ironic/+spec/long-running-deploy-ramdisks Deploy ramdisks are currently booted at deploy time. Some operators may find it desirable if deploy ramdisks were already running at deploy time. This spec discusses what changes should be made to support this. Problem description =================== Hardware POST sequences tend to be very long - up to five minutes. Ironic enforces that a node must be powered off to be deployed to, at which time Ironic boots the node with the deploy ramdisk and deploys an instance. For operators that are willing to accept the tradeoffs of always leaving nodes powered on (running the deploy ramdisk and ready to be deployed to), this is low-hanging fruit for improving deploy times by a large factor. Proposed change =============== The following changes should provide good support for long-running deploy ramdisks: * Handle all validation for driver tasks (deploy, tear_down, etc) in the validate() function of the driver. This will add an ""action"" parameter to the validate() interface, which will be the name of the function being validated, e.g. ""deploy"". This also involves at least moving power state validation for deploy() tasks to the PXE driver's validate function. This will allow the driver to decide what power states are valid for various actions. * Add a script to do a rolling reboot of unprovisioned nodes into a new version of the deploy ramdisk. * Add the ability to automatically reboot a node when the deploy ramdisk or kernel changes in the database. * Store the glance UUID (or some other unique identifier) of the deploy ramdisk with the node in the database. If deploy() is called, and the node is not using the correct ramdisk, reboot into the correct ramdisk. (This is already supported in the PXE driver). * Add a config option to leave deploy ramdisks running. (TODO is this the right thing to do? maybe per-driver/per-node?) * TODO anything else here, that I'm missing? Alternatives ------------ None. Data model impact ----------------- The currently running ramdisk will need to be stored in the driver_info column. REST API impact --------------- None. Driver API impact ----------------- The `validate` method in the driver interface will be modified to accept an ""action"" parameter, which will be the name of the method validation is being done for, e.g. ""deploy"" or ""tear_down"". Validation currently being done in the conductor manager will be expected to move to the driver's validate function. This should be simple to implement across existing drivers - add the parameter to the validate function, and don't use it until any validation is added to the validate method. Nova driver impact ------------------ None. Security impact --------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Scalability impact ------------------ None. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- A new config option will be added to leave deploy ramdisks running. (TODO is this the right thing to do? maybe per-driver/per-node?) This will default to False, leaving no immediate impact. Deployers should also weigh the tradeoffs of always-on nodes versus the current model of powering down nodes. There are implications in terms of power consumption and running hours (potentially wearing on the node). Developer impact ---------------- Developers should take care to do all driver validation in that driver's validate() method. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: jroll Work Items ---------- * Move validation logic in the conductor manager to driver validation. * Add config option to leave ramdisks running. (TODO again, is this right?) * Add ""current deploy kernel/ramdisk"" to driver_info. * Add script to do rolling reboots of unprovisioned nodes into new ramdisk. * Add ability to reboot a node when deploy ramdisk is updated in the DB. * Add check to deploy() call to ensure the node is booted into the current ramdisk. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= Tempest tests should be added to ensure nodes may be left powered on and running the deploy ramdisk, as well as ensuring deploy ramdisk upgrades work as expected. Documentation Impact ==================== This deployment method must be documented. References ========== None. ",,178,0

Using the driver, OpenStack Block Storage hosts can connect to a ScaleIO Storage cluster. This section explains how to configure and connect an OpenStack block storage host to a ScaleIO storage cluster. Support matrix ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ScaleIO: Version 1.32 Supported operations ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Create, delete, clone, attach, and detach volumes - Create and delete volume snapshots - Create a volume from a snapshot - Copy an image to a volume - Copy a volume to an image - Extend a volume - Get volume statistics ScaleIO Block Storage driver configuration ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Edit the ``cinder.conf`` file by adding the configuration below under the ``[DEFAULT]`` section of the file in case of a single back end or under a separate section in case of multiple back ends (for example [ScaleIO]). The configuration file is usually located under the following path ``/etc/cinder/cinder.conf``. For a configuration example, refer to the :ref:`cinder.conf example <cg_configuration_example_emc>` ScaleIO driver name ------------------- Configure the driver name by adding the following parameter: .. code-block:: ini volume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.emc.scaleio.ScaleIODriver ScaleIO MDM server IP --------------------- The ScaleIO Meta Data Manager monitors and maintains the available resources and permissions. To retrieve the MDM server IP, use the :command:`drv_cfg --query_mdms` command. Configure the MDM server IP by adding the following parameter: .. code-block:: ini san_ip = ScaleIO MDM IP ScaleIO protection domain name ------------------------------ ScaleIO allows multiple protection domains (groups of SDSs that provide backup for each other). To retrieve the available protection domains, use the :command:`scli --query_all` command and search for the protection domains section. Configure the protection domain for newly created volumes by adding the following parameter: .. code-block:: ini sio_protection_domain = ScaleIO Protection Domain ScaleIO storage pool name ------------------------- A ScaleIO storage pool is a set of physical devices in a protection domain. To retrieve the available storage pools, use the :command:`scli --query_all` command and search for available storage pools. Configure the storage pool for newly created volumes by adding the following parameter: .. code-block:: ini sio_storage_pool_name = ScaleIO Storage Pool ScaleIO storage pools --------------------- Multiple storage pools and protection domains can be listed for use by the virtual machines. To retrieve the available storage pools, use the :command:`scli --query_all` command and search for available storage pools. Configure the available storage pools by adding the following parameter: .. code-block:: ini sio_storage_pools = Comma separated list of protection domain:storage pool name ScaleIO user credentials ------------------------ OpenStack Block Storage requires a ScaleIO user with administrative privileges. ScaleIO recommends creating a dedicated OpenStack user account that holds an administrative user role. Refer to the ScaleIO User Guide for details on user account management Configure the user credentials by adding the following parameters: .. code-block:: ini san_login = ScaleIO username san_password = ScaleIO password Multiple back ends ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Configuring multiple storage back ends enables you to create several back-end storage solutions that serve the same OpenStack Compute resources. When a volume is created, the scheduler selects the appropriate back end to handle the request, according to the specified volume type. Restarting OpenStack Block Storage ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Save the ``cinder.conf`` file and restart cinder by running the following command: .. code-block:: console $ openstack-service restart cinder-volume .. _cg_configuration_example_emc: Configuration example ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **cinder.conf example file** You can update the ``cinder.conf`` file by editing the necessary parameters as follows: .. code-block:: ini :linenos: [Default] enabled_backends = scaleio [scaleio] volume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.emc.scaleio.ScaleIODriver volume_backend_name = scaleio san_ip = MDM_IP sio_protection_domain = Default_domain sio_storage_pool_name = Default_pool sio_storage_pools = Domain1:Pool1,Domain2:Pool2 san_login = SIO_USER san_password = SIO_PASSWD Configuration options ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The ScaleIO driver supports these configuration options: .. include:: ../../tables/cinder-emc_sio.rst",,185,0
