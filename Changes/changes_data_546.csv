This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ======================================== Mirror nova host aggregates in placement ======================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/placement-mirror-host-aggregates This spec proposes to ensure that the placement service has a placement aggregate record for each nova host aggregate. Problem description =================== Nova host aggregates are useful for grouping collections of ``nova-compute`` service workers together. Certain scheduler filters such as the ``AggregateMultiTenancyIsolationFilter`` `filter`_ look at metadata stored against a nova host aggregate when evaluating whether a hypervisor host meets certain filtering criteria. .. filter_: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/stable/queens/nova/scheduler/filters/aggregate_multitenancy_isolation.py In order to `replace`_ some of these filters with similar filter parameters to the ``GET /allocation_candidates`` placement REST API, we first need to ensure that nova host aggregates that tie collections of ``nova-compute`` service workers together are represented in the placement API as ``placement aggregates`` and associated with the ``resource providder`` records that correspond to the compute node that the ``nova-compute`` service manages. .. replace_: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/alloc-candidates-member-of Use Cases --------- None. Enables use cases described in the following blueprints: * `Placement aggregate allocation ratios`_ * `Placement filter requests`_ .. Placement aggregate allocation ratios_: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/placement-aggregate-allocation-ratios .. Placement filter requests_: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/placement-req-filter Proposed change =============== We propose to modify the ``nova.objects.Aggregate._from_db_obj`` method to check with the placement API to determine if placement has a record of the host aggregate, and if not, populate the placement service with a record for the nova host aggregate. Likewise, on update or delete of the nova host aggregate, the placement service will be informed of the change. A new online data migration will be added to migrate existing host aggregate records using the ``nova-manage`` background data migration tool. Alternatives ------------ We could have adapted the ``nova-compute`` service workers to do this syncing behaviour, but that would have required an upcall from the computes to the nova api layer. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ There will be a negative impact to data-changing operations for the ``nova.objects.Aggregate`` if those methods will need to call out to the placement API as well. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. We should try to ""auto-heal"" the placement aggregate records as much as possible without deployers needing to do anything. Developer impact ---------------- None. Upgrade impact -------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: jaypipes Work Items ---------- * Modify the ``nova.objects.Aggregate._from_db_obj()`` method to look up a corresponding placement aggregate record for the host aggregate's UUID and if not present, populate it * Modify the ``nova.objects.Aggregate.create|save|destroy`` methods to take a corresponding action in the placement API * Create a background data migration task in the ``nova-manage`` tool Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= Normal functional migration tests. Documentation Impact ==================== A release note describing the auto-migration process and inclusion of the background data migration task in ``nova-manage`` should be sufficient. References ========== * Enables these blueprints: * `Placement aggregate allocation ratios`_ * `Placement filter requests`_ ",,155,0

Help text for some image properties (architecture, os_distro) is
pulled from the glanceclient's local version of the image schema.
The URL for those property definitions has gotten out of sync with
Glance.  This patch updates the URL to be the same as that given

This is a combined cherry-pick from:
- https://review.openstack.org/#/c/557650/
- https://review.openstack.org/#/c/559027/

This refactor has the intent of guiding a new OpenStack-Ansible
user towards his first contributions.

The deploy guide is now pointing towards the Developer Guide,
but there is was no guidance given, just a series of topics.

Here, the first page of the developer guide is an onboarding
page, explaining our repos, what's inside them, and how to
contribute. It then links towards all the sections, which
had to be restructured to match a wizard-style flow.

The BGP RTs used in the tests were initially constants, reused
by the different tests.  This is safe only if tests are not
run in parallel, but not when they are concurrently run, because
some routes advertised by one test may be imported in routing
tables from another test.

To solve this, we need to dynamic allocation of RTs so that
different tests use different RTs, to ensure isolation

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================ Libvirt driver emulator threads placement policy ================================================ https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-emulator-threads-policy The Nova scheduler determines CPU resource utilization and instance CPU placement based on the number of vCPUs in the flavor. A number of hypervisors have operations that are being performed on behalf of the guest instance in the host OS. These operations should be accounted and scheduled separately, as well as have their own placement policy controls applied. Problem description =================== The Nova scheduler determines CPU resource utilization by counting the number of vCPUs allocated for each guest. When doing overcommit, as opposed to dedicated resources, this vCPU count is multiplied by an overcommit ratio. This utilization is then used to determine optimal guest placement across compute nodes, or within NUMA nodes. A number of hypervisors, however, perform work on behalf of a guest instance in an execution context that is not associated with the virtual instance vCPUs. With KVM / QEMU, there are one or more threads associated with the QEMU process which are used for the QEMU main event loop, asynchronous I/O operation completion, migration data transfer, SPICE display I/O and more. With Xen, if the stub-domain feature is in use, there is an entire domain used to provide I/O backends for the main domain. Nova does not have any current mechanism to either track this extra guest instance compute requirement in order to measure utilization, nor to place any control over its execution policy. The libvirt driver has implemented a generic placement policy for KVM whereby the QEMU emulator threads are allowed to float across the same pCPUs that the instance vCPUs are running on. In other words, the emulator threads will steal some time from the vCPUs whenever they have work to do. This is just about acceptable in the case where CPU overcommit is being used. However, when guests want dedicated vCPU allocation though, there is a desire to be able to express other placement policies, for example, to allocate one or more pCPUs to be dedicated to a guest's emulator threads. This becomes critical as Nova continues to implement support for real-time workloads, as it will not be acceptable to allow emulator threads to steal time from real-time vCPUs. While it would be possible for the libvirt driver to add different placement policies, unless the concept of emulator threads is exposed to the scheduler in some manner, CPU usage cannot be expressed in a satisfactory manner. Thus there needs to be a way to describe to the scheduler what other CPU usage may be associated with a guest, and account for that during placement. Use Cases --------- With current Nova real time support in libvirt, there is a requirement to reserve one vCPU for running non-realtime workloads. The QEMU emulator threads are pinned to run on the same host pCPU as this vCPU. While this requirement is just about acceptable for Linux guests, it prevents use of Nova to run other real time operating systems which require realtime response for all vCPUs. To broaden the realtime support it is necessary to pin emulator threads separately from vCPUs, which requires that the scheduler be able to account for extra pCPU usage per guest. Project Priority ---------------- None Proposed change =============== A pre-requisite for enabling the emulator threads placement policy feature on a flavor is that it must also have ‘hw:cpu_policy’ set to ‘dedicated’. Each hypervisor has a different architecture, for example QEMU has emulator threads, while Xen has stub-domains. To avoid favoring any specific implementation, the idea is to extend `estimate_instance_overhead` to return 1 additional host CPU to take into account during claim. A user which expresses the desire to isolate emulator threads must use a flavor configured to accept that specification as: * hw:cpu_emulator_threads=isolate Would say that this instance is to be considered to consume 1 additional host CPU. That pCPU used to make running emulator threads is going to always be configured on the related guest NUMA node ID 0, to make it predictable for users. Currently there is no desire to make customizable the number of host CPUs running emulator threads since only one should work for almost every use case. If in the future there is a desire to isolate more than one host CPU to run emulator threads, we would implement instead I/O threads to add granularity on dedicating used resources to run guests on host CPUs. As we said an additional pCPU is going to be consumed but this first implementation is not going to update the user quotas, that in a spirit of simplicity since quotas already leak on different scenarios. To extend the flexibility and address use-cases where resources on hosts are limited. We are introducing 'overhead_pin_set' option on compute node. Operators will have ability to reserve host CPUs for hypervisor overhead. * hw:cpu_emulator_threads=host Would say the emulator threads of all the guests are going to be pinned on a global isolated host pCPUs according 'overhead_pin_set' Alternatives ------------ We could use a host level tunable to just reserve a set of host pCPUs for running emulator threads globally, instead of trying to account for it per instance. This would work in the simple case, but when NUMA is used, it is highly desirable to have more fine grained config to control emulator thread placement. When real-time or dedicated CPUs are used, it will be critical to separate emulator threads for different KVM instances. Another option is to hardcode an assumption that the vCPUs number set against the flavour implicitly includes 1 vCPUs for emulator. eg a vCPU value of 5 would imply 4 actual vCPUs and 1 system pseudo-vCPU. This would likely be extremely confusing to tenant users, and developers alike. Do nothing is always an option. If we did nothing, then it would limit the types of workload that can be run on Nova. This would have a negative impact inparticular on users making use of the dedicated vCPU feature, as there would be no way to guarantee their vCPUs are not pre-empted by emulator threads. It can be worked around to some degree with realtime by setting a fixed policy that the emulator threads only run on the vCPUs that have non-realtime policy. This requires that all guest OS using realtime are SMP, but some guest OS want realtime, but are only UP. Data model impact ----------------- The InstanceNUMATopology object will be extended to have a new field used to store requested policy * emulator_threads_policy=CPUEmulatorThreadsPolicy() This field will be implemented as an enum with two options: * share - The emulator threads float across the pCPUs associated to the guest. * isolate - The emulator threads are isolated on a single pCPU. * host - The emulator threads are isolated on the pCPUs set configure with 'overhead_pin_set' By default 'shared' will be used. It's important to note that: Since [1] on kernel the load-balancing on CPU isolated from the kernel command line using 'isolcpus=' has been removed. It means that the emulator threads are not going to float on the union of pCPUs dedicated to the guest but instead be constrained to the pCPU running vCPU 0. The InstanceNUMACell object will be extended to have a new field where physical CPUs ID will be stored and used by the driver layer to pin emulator threads * cpuset_reserved=SetOfIntegersField(nullable=True) [1] https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable/+/47b8ea7186aae7f474ec4c98f43eaa8da719cd83%5E%21/#F0 REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- For end users, using the option 'cpu_emulator_threads' is going to consume an additional host CPU on the resources quota regarding the guest vCPUs allocated. Performance Impact ------------------ The NUMA and compute scheduler filters will have some changes to them, but it is not anticipated that they will become more computationally expensive to any measurable degree. Other deployer impact --------------------- Deployers who want to use that new feature will have to configure their flavors to use a dedicated cpu policy (hw:cpu_policy=dedicated), in a same time set 'hw:cpu_emulator_threads' to 'isolate'. If deployers prefer isolate all emulator threads of all the guests on a specific set of pCPUs, they will have to configure 'overhead_pin_set' and set configure flavor with 'hw:cpu_emulator_threads' to 'host'. Developer impact ---------------- * Developers of other virtualization drivers may wish to make use of the new flavor extra spec property and scheduler accounting. This will be of particular interest to the Xen hypervisor, if using the stub domain feature. * Developers of metric or GUI systems have to take into account that host CPU overhead which are going to be consumed by instances with a `cpu_emulator_threads` set as `isolate`. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: sahid-ferdjaoui Other contributors: berrange Work Items ---------- * Enhance flavor extra spec to take into account hw:cpu_emulator_threads * Enhance InstanceNUMATopology to take into account cpu_emulator_threads * Make resource tracker to handle 'estimate_instance_overhead' with vcpus * Extend estimate_instance_overhead for libvirt * Make libvirt to corretly pin emulator threads if requested. Dependencies ============ The realtime spec is not a pre-requisite, but is complementary to this work * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-real-time * https://review.openstack.org/#/c/139688/ Testing ======= This can be tested in any CI system that is capable of testing the current NUMA and dedicated CPUs policy. i.e. It requires ability to use KVM and not merely QEMU. Functionnal tests for the scheduling and driver bits (libvirt) are going to be added. Documentation Impact ==================== The documentation detailing NUMA and dedicated CPU policy usage will need to be extended to also describe the new options this work introduces.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License. 5.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Adds a new CI job, kayobe-seed-centos, that deploys a single VM as a
seed host. The VM provided by Zuul is configured as the seed, rather
than a seed hypervisor that provisions a seed VM using nested virt.

This approach should be more reliable, faster, and easier to get

Currently the seed services are deployed, but not tested. A future
change could test discovery and provisioning of an overcloud host using

This patch adds the available_nodes configuration option so that when a
test requires more than one node it can be skipped if it is known that
there are not enough nodes in the environment to test that test.

For API versions >= 1.28, Port & portgroup's .extra['vif_port_id'] was
deprecated in Ocata. Before we can remove support for this, we need to
copy that information to the object's internal_info['tenant_vif_port_id'].

This copy/migration is done at the API layer when the user specifies the
.extra[] value, as well as when the 'ironic db-sync online_data-migrations'
is run.

In order to know whether the ports and port groups have been migrated,
their IronicObject versions are incremented.

This also fixes it so that for API versions < 1.28, the deprecation
warning is not shown, since we still need to support extra['vif_port_id']
in this case.

When a port or portgroup's .extra['vif_port_id'] is removed via a
PATCH API request, that VIF is removed from that object's internal_info.

Eventhough this subsystem is not yet recommended for production, it is stable enough to introduce to the community and something we'd like feedback on as we improve it over the next cycle. OpenStack-Ansible presently supports two different container technologies, LXC and nspawn. These two container technologies can be used separately or together within the same cluster but has a limitation of only one setting per host. Using ``shared-infra_hosts`` as an example, consider this ``openstack_user_config.yml`` configuration: .. code-block:: yaml shared-infra_hosts: infra1: ip: 172.29.236.101 container_vars: container_tech: lxc infra2: ip: 172.29.236.102 container_vars: container_tech: nspawn infra3: ip: 172.29.236.103 In this example the three hosts are assigned to the `shared-infra_hosts` group, and will deploy containerized workloads using ``lxc`` on **infra1**, ``nspawn`` on **infra2**, and ``lxc`` on **infra3**.

The recent ""Meltdown"" CVE fixes have resulted in a critical performance
penalty[*] that will impact every Nova guest with certain CPU models.

I.e. assume you have applied all the ""Meltdown"" CVE fixes, and performed
a cold reboot (explicit stop & start) of all Nova guests, for the
updates to take effect.  Now, if any guests that are booted with certain
named virtual CPU models (e.g. ""IvyBridge"", ""Westmere"", etc), then those
guests, will incur noticeable performance degradation[*], while being
protected from the CVE itself.

To alleviate this guest performance impact, it is now important to
specify an obscure Intel CPU feature flag, 'PCID' (Process-Context ID)
-- for the virtual CPU models that don't already include it (more on
this below).  To that end, this change will allow Nova to explicitly
specify CPU feature flags via a new configuration attribute,
`cpu_model_extra_flags`, e.g. in `nova.conf`:

    ...
    [libvirt]
    cpu_mode = custom
    cpu_model = IvyBridge
    cpu_model_extra_flags = pcid
    ...

NB: In the first iteration, the choices for `cpu_model_extra_flags` is
restricted to only 'pcid' (the option is case-insensitive) -- to address
the earlier mentioned guest performance degradation.  A future patch
will remove this restriction, allowing to add / remove multiple CPU
feature flags, thus making way for other useful features.

Some have asked: ""Why not simply hardcode the 'PCID' CPU feature flag
into Nova?""  That's not graceful, and more importantly, impractical:

  (1) Not every Intel CPU model has 'PCID':

       - The only Intel CPU models that include the 'PCID' capability
         are: ""Haswell"", ""Broadwell"", and ""Skylake"" variants.

       - The libvirt / QEMU Intel CPU models: ""Nehalem"", ""Westmere"",
         ""SandyBridge"", and ""IvyBridge"" will *not* expose the 'PCID'
         capability, even if the host CPUs by the same name include it.
         I.e. 'PCID' needs to be explicitly when using the said virtual
         CPU models.

  (2) Magically adding new CPU feature flags under the user's feet
      impacts live migration.

In Queens release, the version of Ceph is Luminous, and the bluestore is the default store type. [1]_ This spec suggests to allow Kolla Ceph to deploy bluestore OSDs by default, and make the store type configurable. Problem description =================== In Ceph Luminous, the bluestore is the default store type when deploy Ceph. But Kolla currently only supports filestore, it is not align with Ceph default behaviour. We should support both filestore and bluestore in Kolla Ceph. In Ceph bluestore, there are up to three partions belong to one Ceph OSD, they are used for block, block.wal and block.db. We should support to activate the three partitions when deploy Ceph bluestore OSDs if the corresponding labels are defined associated with the pyhsical devices. Use cases --------- 1. Deploy Ceph with Kolla and enable bluestore as default 2. Deploy Ceph with Kolla and enable filestore in the configuration file Proposed change =============== Exposing the store type ----------------------- Define new configuration parameter in Kolla configuration file to indicate the store type used in Kolla Ceph. Existing Kolla Containers ------------------------- In the existing Ceph-OSD container, the OSD store type will be handled when start the Ceph OSD container. If any one label of block, block.wal or block.db is defined, activate the Ceph OSD according to the configuration. If there is no label associated with blck.wal and blck.db, then activate Ceph OSD in one device. Indicate block, block.wal and block.db belonging to the same Ceph OSD according to the partitions' lables, it keeps the same method used in Ceph filestore. * KOLLA_CEPH_OSD_BOOSTRAP_BS_xxx: the block partition of one bluestore OSD * KOLLA_CEPH_OSD_BOOSTRAP_BS_W_xxx: the block.wal of one bluestore OSD * KOLLA_CEPH_OSD_BOOSTRAP_BS_D_xxx: the block.db of one bluestore OSD Here, xxx is the suffix used to indicate the above partitions belong to the same Ceph OSD. Security impact --------------- There is no security impact introduced. Performance Impact ------------------ There is no performance imapct introduced. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Tone Zhang (tone_zrt) Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: Rocky Work Items ---------- 1. Expose OSD store type in Kolla configuration file 2. Check disk partition lables when start Ceph-OSD container if the store type is bluestore 3. Modify the Ceph-OSD starting script to support bluestore 4. Active block, block.wal and block.db configurable in Ceph bluestore OSD Testing ======= The existing gate checks will be used to ensure Ceph bluestore OSD successful deployment. Documentation Impact ==================== The reference page ""Ceph in Kolla"" [2]_ should be updated. The page will document how to change the Ceph store type and how to deploy Ceph bluestore OSD.

For this reason, we're avoiding\ndoing it.\n- we ensure that the chunk size is a multiple of the sector size.\n- the chmod command is not available on Windows. Although changing\nowners is possible, it is not needed. For this reason, the\n'temporary_chown' helper will be a noop on Windows.

This patch makes a few small changes that are required in order to
have the Cinder Backup service working on Windows.

- all physial disks must be open in byte mode. 'rb+' must be used
when writing.
- reading passed the disk size boundary will not return an empty
string, raising an IOError instead. For this reason, we're avoiding
doing it.
- we ensure that the chunk size is a multiple of the sector size.
- the chmod command is not available on Windows. Although changing
owners is possible, it is not needed. For this reason, the
'temporary_chown' helper will be a noop on Windows. It's easier to
do it here rather than do platform checks wherever this gets called.
- when connecting the volumes, we pass the 'expect_raw_disk' argument,
which provides a hint to the connector about what we expect. This
allows the SMBFS connector to return a mounted raw disk path instead
of a virtual image path.
- when the driver provides temporary snapshots to be used during
the backup process, the API is bypassed. For this reason, we need to
ensure that the snapshot state and progress gets updated accordingly.
Otherwise, this breaks the nova assisted snapshot workflow.

We're doing platform checks, ensuring that we don't break/change
the current workflow.

The Swift and Posix backup drivers are known to be working on Windows.

This patch makes the naming of containers more operator friendly.
A sharding/sharded root container would create a <container>_root.db
to manage the shardranges. This signifies that it's a root container
to ops or anyone looking on disk.
When shards cleave, the sharding db that holds the cleaving shardranges
are called <container>_shard.db. Once a shard has completed sharding
the original db is unlinked, then the container is marked as deleted,
so these _shard.db files will be reclaimed.

This patch basically makes looking at the ondisk database files easier
to grok and understand.

This allows the kubelet to do the necessary container probes. The
problem is that if we run host networking pods that need to access the

Several tempest tests are failing when using the VMware virt driver
where compute hostname != hypervisor_hostname. Those are different
things and cannot be used interchangeably. This patch fixes a
regression introduced with commit 1dc2e231 where the hosts_client was
replaced with hypervisor_client in order to select hosts which are both
up and enabled.

This patch changes the implementation of get_host_other_than() to use
services_client which still allows to select nova computes which are up
and enabled but also gives us the compute hostname.

If a distributed router has interfaces on multiple tenant networks, with
'fast exit' functionality policy based rules are created in qrouter
namespace for every tenant network subnet and 'from <cidr>' is included
into an 'ip rule' command invocation.

When a port on a tenant network is deleted 'from <cidr>' part is not
included and a first rule matching specified parameters gets deleted.

For example with the following layout

ip netns exec qrouter-4f9ca9ef-303b-4082-abbc-e50782d9b800 ip rule
0:      from all lookup local
32766:  from all lookup main

80000:  from 192.168.200.0/24 lookup 16

and neutron l3 agent will use this command

ip netns exec qrouter-4f9ca9ef-303b-4082-abbc-e50782d9b800 ip -4 rule\
del priority 80000 table 16 type unicast

and 192.168.100.0/24 rule will get deleted even if you actually removed
a port on 192.168.200.0.

This results in an extra rule present and not cleaned up and the right
rule removed. It is only recreated if a router is disabled and enabled
again.

additional changes:

1) Floating IP rules are identified by priority only as implemented
currently - for this reason this change adds fixed_ip to the rule
removal code. Rule priorities are 32-bit values in iproute2 so,
in theory, those should be not be used to cover IPv6.

2) IP protocol information for 'from all' rules is currently
derived from link-local address IP version. The same approach
is preserved by using version-specific /0 addresses without
changing the API provided by ip_lib.

When a network becomes isolated and isolated_metadata_enabled=True, the DHCP
agent won't spawn the required metadata proxy instance unless the agent gets
restarted. Similarly, it won't stop them when the network is no longer
isolated.

This patch fixes it by updating the isolated metadata proxy on port_update_end
and port_delete_end methods which are invoked every time a router interface
port is added, updated or deleted.

If a distributed router has interfaces on multiple tenant networks, with
'fast exit' functionality policy based rules are created in qrouter
namespace for every tenant network subnet and 'from <cidr>' is included
into an 'ip rule' command invocation.

When a port on a tenant network is deleted 'from <cidr>' part is not
included and a first rule matching specified parameters gets deleted.

For example with the following layout

ip netns exec qrouter-4f9ca9ef-303b-4082-abbc-e50782d9b800 ip rule
0:      from all lookup local
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup default
80000:  from 192.168.100.0/24 lookup 16
80000:  from 192.168.200.0/24 lookup 16

and neutron l3 agent will use this command

ip netns exec qrouter-4f9ca9ef-303b-4082-abbc-e50782d9b800 ip -4 rule\
del priority 80000 table 16 type unicast

and 192.168.100.0/24 rule will get deleted even if you actually removed
a port on 192.168.200.0.

This results in an extra rule present and not cleaned up and the right
rule removed. It is only recreated if a router is disabled and enabled
again.

additional changes:

1) Floating IP rules are identified by priority only as implemented
currently - for this reason this change adds fixed_ip to the rule
removal code. Rule priorities are 32-bit values in iproute2 so,
in theory, those should be not be used to cover IPv6.

2) IP protocol information for 'from all' rules is currently
derived from link-local address IP version. The same approach
is preserved by using version-specific /0 addresses without
changing the API provided by ip_lib.

The ComputeManager.pre_live_migration method, which runs on the
destination host during live migration, calls setup_networks_on_host
with the destination host which causes the ""migrating_to"" attribute
to get set to the destination host in the port binding profile. This
is to initiate setting up floating IP information on the destination
host for DVR.

The ComputeManager.post_live_migration_at_destination method calls the
same method from the destination host, so at this point the ""migrating_to""
attribute is already set to the destination host in the port binding
profile from pre_live_migration and we make unnecessary port update calls
to Neutron for each port attached to the instance.

This change simply checks to see if the ""migrating_to"" attribute is
already set to the given host and if so, skips the port update call.

When running probetests in a loop I discovered that the
container-servers were not always shutdown cleanly.  When handling the
SIGTERM received by a manager the parent process would occasionally
crash an assertion in the eventlet hub by doing blocking I/O in a signal
handler.  The child process would never receive the forwarded SIGTERM

By moving all I/O (logging and the associated PipeMutex locking) out of
the signal handler the child processes can reliably shutdown cleanly.

In my samples the test seems to be significantly more stable.

This patch swaps the order of doing api_db sync with db_sync.
The API database migration should be run before the migrations for
the main/cell databases. This is because the former contains
information about how to find and connect to the latter.

This was discovered in Rocky since we added a data model change
(a new column to the cell_mappings table) that depends on db sync
being run after having added this new column to the api_db (i.e running
api_db sync before db sync). The data model change was the first time
where the actual sync order became meaningful.

This has been correctly done in devstack and the fact that grenade was
doing the db sync before api_db sync was hidden by the fact that
devstack had run at least once before reaching this part of grenade,
which meant that the database was already initialized.

item_allocator class maintains the allocation of

There may be cases where the key has been already
released or not being remembered while trying to

item_allocator class maintains the allocation of
items(link local address) from a given pool.
There may be cases where the key has been already
released or not being remembered while trying to
release it.
So it makes sense to lookup for the key before
releasing the key.

Enhance the code that migrates the ConfKeyManager's fixed_key to
Barbican to also consider the Backup table. When the original key
migration feature was added, the encryption key ID was not stored in
the Backup table. But now the Backup table contains that field, so
the migration code needs to handle that table as well.

Whereas the cinder-volume service is responsible for migrating keys
in the Volume and Snapshot tables, the cinder-backup service handles
migrating keys in the Backup table. Each instance of the service
migrates its own entries by matching the ""host"" field in the
corresponding tables.

The Backup OVO now inherits from base.CinderComparableObject. This does
not affect the object's hash signature, and so the version number does
need to be incremented.

Everyone seems to agree that the only sane ordering of these operations
is ""api first, cell after."" However, grenade and our own documentation
shows the api database as coming after the main one. I believe this
was added to grenade in a sort of append operation, and thus after the
main database. This was done back when usage of the API database was
still optional (for upgrades) and thus the ordering didn't matter much.
Since the process has been correct (api first) in devstack for a long
time, and since grenade runs after devstack, we haven't had any issues.
A recent change to add something to a core data structure column format
highlighted the out-of-order-ness of this.

I also believe the docs got the same append behavior when adding the
command to the list, and/or it may have been copied from grenade, which
is our in-code manifestation of the upgrade steps.

In the 'wait_for_resource_delete' method of the 'ClientTestBase' class,
the following statement is executed when timeout.

  self.fail(""The resource '%s' still exists."" % resource.id)

The 'resource' variable is passed in the argument of
the 'wait_for_resource_delete' method.
It is sometimes a string which is a resource ID.

When it is a string (a resource ID), AttributeError is raised
at the statement.
This patch fixes the issue.

In the ""Update Aggregate"" API,
if both an availability zone and a name are not specified,
a 400 error is returned.

It should be checked in the novaclient side (nova command).

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Support traits in Glance ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/glance-image-traits This blueprint proposes to extend the granular scheduling of compute instances to be based on traits provided by glance image metadata in addition to the traits provided by the flavor. Problem description =================== Cloud administrative users might want to put some qualitative attributes on workload images to assert control on where these workloads will be scheduled. These attributes can then be used as hints by the scheduler so that it can pick the right set of compute hosts which can support these workloads. The attributes on the image can be used to specify traits required on the hosts. For example support for a specific CPU instruction set, nic features or traits which enumerate the hosts location or trusted status etc Use Cases --------- As a cloud administrator, i want to be able to assert further control on where certain workloads can be launched and be operational. For example, if a workload instance will be applying an export controlled encryption algorithm or will process privacy data, there might be specific laws requiring workloads to be restricted to hosts within a specific region(Geo-fencing) The administrator would be able to add this region restriction to the glance image as a required trait. This would allow the nova scheduler to automatically select only hosts which belong to that region. For administrative users * Allow administrators to specify a set of traits that an image requires. Proposed change =============== Currently the traits information specified in the flavor is being collected as part of the boot request. This information is provided to the Placement API which uses it to filter out resource providers which do not express those traits. We propose to allow traits to be specified in the image metadata to be part of this work flow. The boot request will combine the traits information provided by the flavor AND the image metadata. This combined set of traits will be passed to the Placement API to generate allocation candidates. The glance image already allow users to specify additional properties as key:value pairs. We will be re-using the same mechanism. We propose to add `trait:` as a prefix so we can reuse the same name space as the traits specified in the flavor extra_specs. The trait syntax in the glance image's additional properties looks like:: trait:HW_CPU_X86_AVX2=required trait:CUSTOM_TRUSTED_HOST=required trait:CUSTOM_LOCATION_USA=required For now the only valid value is `required`. Validation of traits specified as part of the image additional properties is out of scope for this change. Alternatives ------------ Continue with the current model of utilizing the traits provided as part of the flavor in the boot request. To enable the use case described above for Geo-fencing, this would mean that the cloud administrator would need to create specific flavors with traits required for the workload image. If the end user ends up selecting a different flavor other than the specific ones created by the administrator for the Geo-fencing use case, then the workload could be in non-compliance with the data laws. One other aspect to look at would be, because the flavor describes both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the request, the number of flavor will need to increase substantially if we are given a mix of workloads. In a typical openstack installation with 7 flavors(nano -> xlarge) if we need to add one region restriction by traits to each of the flavors we will end up with 14 flavors. If we need further sub-regions or other trait restrictions along with the quantitative aspects, this number will grow pretty quickly. Another potential alternative is to provide traits directly as part of the instance boot request. But this has the same issue where the end user could forget to select the right traits. With Image based traits the administrator sets the traits once on the image and the approach is immune to user errors during launch. Data model impact ----------------- None.

This patch fixes the URLs for the stretch-queens Debian repo.
First, it uses the now standardized scheme for the backport
URL: http://<debian-release>-<openstack-release>.debian.net/debian,
maintained by the Debian OpenStack team.

Then it uses $::lsbdistcodename everywhere, to be able to work
with all Debian releases.

Finally, this patch fixes unit tests to work with stretch and queens
as default.

``required_services`` validator should not check services which are

The inner check for ``api_versions@openstack`` in ``required_services``

systemd-resolved has a new behaviour in bionic, in that if there is no
/etc/resolv.conf file when it installs, it assumes it is a fresh
system and makes /etc/resolf.conf a symlink into its compatability
files.

dib ends up saving & restoring whatever /etc/resolv.conf we have after
the inital chroot creation, which may not be what we want -- in the
above case it restores the system-resolved symlink.  For
openstack-infra, we use unbound and want simply ""127.0.0.1"" in a
/etc/resolv.conf file [1].

Formalise the ability to save specific contents into the final image.
Add documentation, and a note in the code that it's an external
interface.

I would have preferred to namespace the .ORIG file with DIB_ or
similar, but this unofficial interface has already escaped into the
wild.  Leave it as is for simplicity.

and had not made the change to the new style.

As the old aggregate handler had no exceptions imported, there was no
merge conflict when the exceptions change merged. At the same time
the exception in question is not covered by tests, because it only
happens if there is a concurrent update, which we don't cover in the
gabbi tests. We do cover a generation conflict on a supplied
generation, but that's not the same thing.

So basically this went by without us noticing and I happened to notice
while doing something else, so here's a fix for it.

To test it, a new directory for unit tests for handlers is added and
a new file, test_aggregate. Following the guidelines in
https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/contributor/placement.html#testing
the problematic code has been extracted to its own private method so that
it can be tested as a unit with limited mocking. The overarching flow
of setting aggregates continues to be tested by the gabbi functional
tests.

Note the added NOTE in the new _set_aggregates method: It appears that
the DBDuplicateEntry exception maybe doesn't need to be there.

To setup proper navigation to side bar and breadcrumb,
this patch adds new 'defaultIndexUrl' parameter and
its getter/setter into resource-type-service.

The 'defaultIndexUrl' parameter makes details view
enable to set navigations properly in Angular-side.

Each panel module should set URL for default index view
using 'defaultIndexUrl' parameter. So, this patch adds
the `defaultIndexUrl` parameter into existing panel
modules that have Angularized details view.

Also, if query string has 'nav' parameter, the
navigation setting will be overwitten with it.
This URL overwriting may be used by panels that has
multiple index panels, like images panel.

When creating a service of type 'LoadBalancer', you create
a cloud network load balancer.
This provides an externally-accessible IP address that sends
traffic to the correct port on your cluster nodes.
The external IP address is stored in k8s service's status
information (under loadbalancer/ingress/ip).

Kuryr implements this capability using OpenStack floating IP
functionality.
This patch updates Kuryr to store external IP information only after
LB was entirely configured in OpenStack.

The journal within systemd is able to be shipped from a physical hosts
to a centralized location. This change introduces
`systemd-journal-remote` which will ship all journals on the physical
host to the log host and store the journals under
""/var/log/journal/remote"". This change gives deployers greater
visability into the cloud using the systemd built-ins.

> NOTE: This change is all accomplished in a playbook using our common
        roles. While this could be moved into a role by itself, it would
        be a waist of effort given how small this change is.

Given all services are inherently logging to the journal, this change
may allow us to one day deprecate or minimize the usage of our
rsyslog roles. If we were to remove the requirement for rsyslog to run
everywhere we could reduce overall internal cluster IO (CPU, network and
block) and remove the requirement for all services to ship log files from
all containers and hosts. This change is NOT modifying the integrated
logging architecture. At this time we're simply ensuring that the
journals on the physical host are co-located on the logging machines.

At this time there's no suitable package available for
systemd-journal-remote on suse so the playbook to install and setup
remote journalling is being omitted when the suse is detected. When a
suitable package is found the playbook omission should be removed.

Before, when cleaving a shard, only objects that fell within a
destination shard range were cleaved. Any misplaced objects *may* have
been dealt with by a previous invocation of the misplaced objects
handler, but that was not guaranteed.

This patch introduces a further call to misplaced objects specifically
to move any misplaced objects in the database that is being cleaved.

If a distributed router has interfaces on multiple tenant networks, with
'fast exit' functionality policy based rules are created in qrouter
namespace for every tenant network subnet and 'from <cidr>' is included
into an 'ip rule' command invocation.

When a port on a tenant network is deleted 'from <cidr>' part is not
included and a first rule matching specified parameters gets deleted.

For example with the following layout

ip netns exec qrouter-4f9ca9ef-303b-4082-abbc-e50782d9b800 ip rule
0:      from all lookup local
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup default
80000:  from 192.168.100.0/24 lookup 16
80000:  from 192.168.200.0/24 lookup 16

and neutron l3 agent will use this command

ip netns exec qrouter-4f9ca9ef-303b-4082-abbc-e50782d9b800 ip -4 rule\
del priority 80000 table 16 type unicast

and 192.168.100.0/24 rule will get deleted even if you actually removed
a port on 192.168.200.0.

This results in an extra rule present and not cleaned up and the right
rule removed. It is only recreated if a router is disabled and enabled
again.

additional changes:

1) Floating IP rules are identified by priority only as implemented
currently - for this reason this change adds fixed_ip to the rule
removal code. Rule priorities are 32-bit values in iproute2 so,
in theory, those should be not be used to cover IPv6.

2) IP protocol information for 'from all' rules is currently
derived from link-local address IP version. The same approach
is preserved by using version-specific /0 addresses without
changing the API provided by ip_lib.

NEC driver deletes access permission from nodes in the method
remove_export().
However, the method remove_export() is not called after live-migration.
After live-migration, access permission of the live-migration source
node is not deleted.

This patch adds the step to delete access permission from the node
in the method terminate_connection().
The terminate_connection() is called after live-migration and
access permission of the source node is deleted.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =================================== Support Qinling function versioning =================================== https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2001587 Function versions are like git commits, they’re snapshots of your project history. Each version has a number that serves as its ID, starting with 1 and incrementing up, and never reused. The code for a published version of a function is immutable (i.e. cannot be changed). So, a version number corresponds to a specific set of function code with certainty. With function versioning, users can get the following benifits: - Update the function code without breaking the existing applications that rely on the function. - Easy to backup/restore different versions of code for the same function. Problem description =================== - As a function developer, I want to keep the existing code when I update the function so that it is easy to restore when something is wrong during the testing. - As an application developer who relies on the Qinling functions, I want a safe and sustainable way to call the functions without changing the applications after the function is updated. Proposed change =============== Data model impact ----------------- A new database table needs to be created to store the mappings from function to its versions and locations. There may be different function versions that stored in the same location, e.g. when user creates a new version but without any function code change, the previous function version location will be reused to save the storage space. A new field is added to execution table and job table denoting which function version the execution or job is using, 0 means using the latest version. REST API impact --------------- * Create function version. After creation, Qinling returns the function version information, including function id, version uuid, version sequence number(starting from 1), description and timestamps. * POST ``/functions/<function-id>/versions`` * Parameters: description * Update function version. Only updating description is allowed for now. * PUT ``/functions/<function_id>/versions/<version_id>`` * Parameters: description * Get function versions. * GET ``/functions/<function_id>/versions/`` * Get specific function version. We use version sequence number instead of version uuid because it makes much more sense to end user. The version uuid may be used internally. * GET ``/functions/<function_id>/versions/<version_sequence_number>`` * Delete specific function version. Function version can be deleted only if there is no corresponding execution running and no association with running jobs and webhooks. If the function version code location is shared with others, do not delete the function version package. * DELETE ``/functions/<function_id>/versions/<version_id>`` * Create execution. Version sequence number needs to be specified when executing the function, latest version is used by default. * Create job. Version sequence number needs to be specified when creating the job, latest version is used by default. * Create webhook. Version sequence number needs to be specified when creating the webhook, latest version is used by default. * Delete function. Qinling needs to support to delete the function with all its versions. End user impact --------------- All the API changes should be supported in CLI. Performance Impact ------------------ None Deployer impact --------------- Database migration script is provided. Alternatives ------------ None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Lingxian Kong <anlin.kong@gmail.com> Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Pay attention to the notes written in ``REST API impact`` section.

The requirements.txt contents do not need to be
installed on to the host. The majority of the
requirements are for ansible, or for release
and management tooling which needs to use the
Ansible runtime venv.

Rather than forcing the installation of pip on
the host, we only install virtualenv via distro
packages (where possible). With virtualenv in
place we can create the runtime venv and install
pip, etc and all requirements into there.

Doing this keeps the system python libraries as
clean as possible, preventing clashes with other
packages (eg: ceph) which try to install other
python libraries which conflict on CentOS.

The recently merged change Ie8543bed3363aac539cfd35e04e8dfaaa166ebc3
added five new options to undercloud.conf to drive the container
prepare during undercloud install. However this is not nearly as
flexible as the prepare workflow for overcloud deploy, which can have
multiple entries in the ContainerImagePrepare parameter list.

This change removes those new options, and uses the specified
container_images_file file as the source for the ContainerImagePrepare
parameter *or* the container image parameters.

If no file is specified, the environment has a default
ContainerImagePrepare parameter set which will result in a working
undercloud based on the defaults in kolla_builder.

updates the glance install guide to reflect that change.

Backporting because this issue is collecting a lot of duplicate bug filings.

In the failover flow we alreday wait for the port detach but
this isn't happening in the delete flow causing lb deletes to

The requirements.txt contents do not need to be
installed on to the host. The majority of the
requirements are for ansible, or for release
and management tooling which needs to use the
Ansible runtime venv.

Rather than forcing the installation of pip on
the host, we only install virtualenv via distro
packages (where possible). With virtualenv in
place we can create the runtime venv and install
pip, etc and all requirements into there.

Doing this keeps the system python libraries as
clean as possible, preventing clashes with other
packages (eg: ceph) which try to install other
python libraries which conflict on CentOS.

This changed old behavior, which was that required fields were only validated server-side. This patch restores old behavior by setting use_required_attribute to False for the inherited AuthenticationForm. This problem arose because when WebSSO is enabled and a non-keystone-credentials authentication method is selected from the dropdown list, the now-hidden username and password fields are still marked ""required"" and still validated client-side, even though they are invisible to the user and cannot be filled in. It would be nice to fix the javascript to properly turn the ""required"" attribute on or off depending on what authentication method is selected and whether the ""required"" fields are even visible, but for now this just restores the behavior we had before Djanto 1.10.

regardless of how other services are deployed (e.g. with lib/neutron).
This breaks deployment using lib/neutron.

Switching to new names doesn't change anything substantial because
devstack plugin equally handles both variants. It allows to use new
devstack neutron library though.

Produce *nicer* stdout for better visualisation of state/errors,
like those details hidden in huge JSON dicts and virt-customize
results.

Omit empty strings/lists/dicts in task exec results, like:
""stdout"": """", ""ansible_facts"": {}, ""ansible_included_var_files"": []
This shortens the deploy log w/o useful info and improves readability.

Capture ansible's task execution results stored in the status tags like
""message"", ""cmd"", ""get_xml"", ""std*"", ""rc"", line-wrapped nicely.

Important task exec tags like ""end"", ""start"", ""rc"", ""delta"" et al
are aligned by new lines, which gives a consistent view repeated
through all the tasks executed.

Store those to stdout and _quickstart_nice.log.
Store raw ansible logs as is in _quickstart.log (as is).

This refactoring is for making the code structure more consistent.
In particular, the image driver will be decoupled from compute
manager and align with volume/network driver.
In the new structure, compute manager is mainly for interfacing
with docker driver and docker driver is for interfacing with
image/volume/network drivers.

When extending an existing sub-resource definition, the
SUB_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP must define the extended resources/attributes
under the 'parameters' object. This instructs the API internals to
update the existing sub-resource's attribute map rather than just
overwrite it. For internals see the logic in the extend_resources()
method in neutron.api.extensions [1]. For example the
qos_bw_limit_direction in neutron uses this approach for its
BANDWIDTH_LIMIT_RULES definition (also see related lib commit
I823f567ddf9c895eb3cf94e95ae34a382d67f51d).

This patch adds that support to the base api def test case and also
updates the contributor internals to document such. No release note
included since nothing changed from a consumption perspective.
