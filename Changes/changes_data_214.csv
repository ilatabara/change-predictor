The accounting of VM's running hours of os-simple-tenant-usage API
method is wrong (is our perspective). If there are multiple, and different
events such as start/stop/pause/resume, the method will not catch all of these
different situations and account partially the number of hours that the
VM was running in the given period. Of course, in the docs it says that it
will account only the diff between the creation time, and the current (end of period)
time. However, the method is called `usage`, and this led us to believe that it would
report usage data, and not only allocation data.

We mapped some use cases that the method does not work with the previous implementation:
- VM was stopped for the given period: the VM was stopped, and was started in the
 given period. Therefore, we need a partial accounting only for the running time.
- The VM was running, and it was stopped: The VM was running, it was stopped, and then
 started back again. Therefore, we should only account for the running times of the VM
 (discarding the period it was stopped).
- If the VM was terminated, it would only consider the last time the VM was launched
 to execute the calculation. However, this is wrong (even by the method documentation).

The bug was discovered in Rocky, Nova version 18.0.1. The implementation of the method is
still the same in Master. We also think that there are other inconsistencies in this
method, but we will address them one by one.

This implementation does not change the old behavior. It is preserved by default, in case
someone needs it. We just enable operators to customize it; so, they can tailor their
business needs.

cloud-init creates /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/99-cloud-init.conf,
for NetworkManager to not update resolv.conf. However, subsequent
update of NetworkManager seems to remove that file as there is no
config(noreplace) directive for it. So after an update/upgrade of

cloud-init do configuration only one time during first instance
boot. So this would ensure resolv.conf is not touched during

flake8 new release 3.8.0 added new checks and gate pep8
job start failing. hacking 3.0.1 fix the pinning of flake8 to
avoid bringing in a new version with new checks.

Though it is fixed in latest hacking but 2.0 and 3.0 has cap for
flake8 as <4.0.0 which mean flake8 new version 3.9.0 can also
break the pep8 job if new check are added.

To avoid similar gate break in future, we need to bump the hacking min
version.

As part of Train community goal 'Support IPv6-Only Deployments and Testing'[1],
Tempest has defined the base job 'devstack-tempest-ipv6' (adding
in Depends-On patch) which will deploy services on IPv6.

This commit adds the new job 'qinling-tempest-ipv6-only'
run on gate which is derived from 'devstack-tempest-ipv6'.

Verification structure will be:
- 'devstack-IPv6' deploy the service on IPv6
- 'devstack-tempest-ipv6' run will verify the IPv6-only setting and listen address
- 'qinling-tempest-ipv6-only' will run the tests.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =========================== Searching admin-only fields =========================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/searchlight/+spec/index-level-role-separation Our aim is to allow all fields to be searchable and available in facets but only for users where that is appropriate; as such, we introduced the idea of filtering search results based on whether or not a user has the admin role. The flaw that we discovered towards the end of Liberty is described in https://bugs.launchpad.net/searchlight/+bug/1504399, but very briefly, merely removing fields from the result is not sufficient. It is possible to 'fish' for values for known fields by running searches against them and examining whether results come back; an attacker might use range or wildcard queries to reduce the time it takes to locate values that return results. Problem Description =================== We wish to allow plugins to define fields (whether in code or in configuration) that cannot be seen by non-administrative users, be that in search results, visible in facets or by searching for values for a field. Administrators should be subject to none of these restrictions. Prior to the fix in bug #1504399 Searchlight fulfilled the first two of these criteria. Unfortunately the fix (which was under a very tight time restriction) prevented even administrators from searching fields. The problem, therefore, is to ensure these conditions. Proposed Change =============== Role-based filtering -------------------- This solution involves indexing twice and adding a field to all resources that can be used to filter a search based on a user's role. For instance, taking a heavily cut-down Nova server definition:: { ""_id"": ""aaaaabbbb-1111-4444-2222-eeee"", ""_type"": ""OS::Nova::Server"", ""_source"": { ""status"", ""ACTIVE"", ""OS-EXT-ATTR-SOMETHING"": ""admin only data"" } } This is turned into two documents, identical except that: * the admin-only document has an additional field `'user-role': 'admin'` * the user document has an additional field `'user-role': 'user'` * the user document does not contain the `OS-EXT-ATTR-SOMETHING` field * the ids for each document have a role added (`111111-4444-2222-eeee:ADMIN`) Indexing ~~~~~~~~ Indexing operations are unchanged except that two operations (or one bulk operation) are needed. Admin-only fields would be stripped from the serialized source document for the non-admin copy:: { ""_id"": ""aaaaabbbb-1111-4444-2222-eeee_ADMIN"", ""_type"": ""OS::Nova::Server"", ""_source"": { ""status"", ""ACTIVE"", ""OS-EXT-ATTR-SOMETHING"": ""admin only data"", ""_searchlight_user_role"": ""admin"" } }, { ""_id"": ""aaaaabbbb-1111-4444-2222-eeee_USER"", ""_type"": ""OS::Nova::Server"", ""_source"": { ""status"", ""ACTIVE"", ""_searchlight-user-role"": ""user"" } } This solution allows resources that don't need an admin/user separation to index a single document with both roles:: { ""_id"": ""abcdefa-1222"", ""_type"": ""OS::Designate::Zone"", ""_source"": { ""_searchlight-user-role"": [""admin"", ""user""] } } Searches ~~~~~~~~ The server can apply a non-analyzed (term) filter on `_searchlight-user-role` based on the request context:: { ""query"": {... }, ""filter"": {""term"": {""_searchlight-user-role"": ""admin""}} } Filters are cached and very fast. An alternative, once we switch to using aliases (see the `zero downtime spec <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/245222/>`_ proposal), is applying the filter on the alias:: { ""index"": ""searchlight-<timestamp>"", ""alias"": ""searchlight-admin"", ""filter"": {""term"": {""_searchlight-user-role"": ""admin""}} } The search API would query against `searchlight-admin` or `searchlight-user` as appropriate. There is some precedent for this; it's a common way to make data appear to be segmented based on a field ('index per user' - Reference_) without the overhead of multiple lucene indices. .. _Reference: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/faking-it.html Second choice - Separate indexes -------------------------------- .. note:: This began as my frontrunner, but the added maintenance headache has pushed me towards filter-based separation. Another solution is to maintain separate indices for admin and non-admin users. While this seems offensive from a duplication point of view, it's very common in non-relational-databases to store information based on the kinds of queries you want to run. There will be an impact on indexing speed and data storage, though I believe the volume and throughput of data we store makes this impact insignificant. The major downside is the increased maintenance overhead (at a minimum, two indices would be required at least for those plugins requiring it). Technically, introducing a pair of indices isn't terribly complicated; all write operations become two, and searches determine which index they're using before running. As far as a user sees, there will be no impact (except that admins will once again be able to run searches against admin-only fields). Indexing ~~~~~~~~ Information in the -users index can be restricted with dynamic_mapping template (that can tell Elasticsearch not to store or index matching fields with `index:no` and `include_in_all:no`). Along with result filtering (or `_source` filtering or removing these fields from the indexed document) this achieves all three requirements. Some plugins do not have admin-only fields, and those plugins could run against the same index. I believe, though, that it would be necessary to use a separate shared index in that case, because otherwise a query could potentially run against (say) `OS::Nova::Server` in both indices. For example, the structure below assumes `OS::Something::Else` doesn't need two indices, and all data is in the user index:: searchlight-admin: OS::Nova::Server searchlight-user: OS::Nova::Server OS::Something::Else An admin query against both types would have to run against both indices, running the risk of duplicate results for `OS::Nova::Server` resources. This might need more discussion, but safer would be to either mandate storing information twice for all types, or:: searchlight-admin: OS::Nova::Server searchlight-user: OS::Nova::Server searchlight-all: OS::Something::Else Searches ~~~~~~~~ Little would change as far as a user is concerned. The search code would have some extra conditionals in it to determine which index to use. This would be complicated if an index contains both admin- and non-admin- data. Alternatives ------------ There are two other alternatives I'm aware of. 1. `Elasticsearch Shield <https://www.elastic.co/products/shield>`_. Shield adds a number of features to Elasticsearch, all aimed at security and authentication. One of those features (supported only by Elasticsearch 2.0) is `field level access control <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/shield/current/setting-up-field-and-document-level-security.html>`_. This requires an inclusive list of fields to be given in configuration on a per-index basis, and also requires Shield's authentication to be enabled (there are various plugins available). It disables the `_all` field for users who are subject to field level restrictions. Most importantly, Shield is a commercial, closed-source product that runs on the server, and so is able to do things we are not (since it has access to the parsed query). 2. Modify or reject incoming queries. We already strip certain fields from search results for non-admin users, and in theory we could restrict searches in the same way (or raise Not Authorized exceptions). While naively this seems straightforward, in reality it becomes complex quite quickly. Imagine the following queries against Nova for a protected field called `hypervisor_id`:: {""query"": {""term"": {""hypervisor_id"": ""abcd1""}}} {""query"": {""query_string"": {""query"": ""hypervisor_id:abcd1""}}} {""query"": {""multi_match"": {""query"": ""abcd1"", ""fields"": [""hypervisor_id""]}}} {""query"": {""query_string"": {""query"": ""abcd1""}}} Constructing filters to catch those queries isn't impossible, but becomes increasingly complex; we would essentially need to parse the query, and we'd need to do so for each plugin type.

Normaly We have one Openstack(Keystone) cluster for Identity Provider and many Openstack clusters for Service Provider. In that case, If we would like to use Searchlight, We have to deploy Searchlight and Elasticsearch on every Openstack Cluster. Then We can only search in current Openstack. Searchlight's vision [#]_ would like to support multi-cloud. In this case, we will support multi-openstack. User can search through all Openstack clusters which are federated.

Most of the services in openstack have notification
events which are sent in near real-time for the
ongoing changes to service data.

For services which don't generate any notifications,
searchlight cannot keep the data in elasticsearch
updated with latest changes in source service.

Client Library provides direct indexing to elasticsearch
from swift.

For keeping the data in sync with ongoing changes in the source system, it listens to notifications sent by the services and updates elasticsearch for changes. Source service has to either send notifications or call searchlight for ongoing changes on source data. Problem Description =================== Most of the services in openstack have notification events which are sent in near realtime for the ongoing changes to service data. For services which don't generate any notifications, searchlight cannot keep the data in elasticsearch updated with latest changes in source service. Proposed Change =============== Following options are identified for services which don't generate notifications. 1. Update the service like swift to generate notifications. 2. Create a client library which can be used by the service to update elasticsearch directly behind the searchlight. The library will not have any dependencies and will use http client to directly communicate with elasticsearch for sending updates. 3. Create a client library which is similar to option 2 but uses elasticsearch python client library to communicate with elasticsearch Option 1 is the recommended option. If notifications cannot be sent due to some restrictions on source service, next best option would be 3 and then 2. Option 2 and 3 will have the disadvantage of not utilizing the full capabilities of searchlight like zero down time reindexing.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ====================== RBAC - Based on Policy ====================== One of the important functionality provided by Searchlight is protecting the data indexed in Elasticsearch. It implements the Resource based access control similar to how a source service implements its RBAC (Glance, Nova etc). Each source service implements RBAC in a combination of policy file and custom code. Searchlight matches the same security control by creating filters(RBAC Filters) which are prepended to all user queries prior to execution on Elasticsearch. Problem Description =================== RBAC filters in Searchlight are created within the plugin code of each service. Plugin code is isolated to each service but any changes to RBAC on source service [0] requires a change in its corresponding plugin code. We need to address 1. Able to update RBAC without changing the code 2. Easy to understand the policy code 3. Able to handle complex policies Current RBAC Elasticsearch filters of Searchlight plugins [1] are provided in reference section. Proposed Change =============== Move RBAC logic from Elasticsearch filters inside plugin code to OSLO Policy [0] based json file. Based on the analysis of the current filters [2], most of the input variables to the filter are available within the request context except for parent plugin type and data from config file(swift reads auth_prefix from config file). Parent plugin type can be specified as a literal value since it doesn't change. When RBAC is specified as a policy json file, it will not be used in traditional way of enforcing a policy within a service by calling the policy engine. Instead these policies will be converted to Elasticsearch filters which would then run in Elasticsearch engine. The advantage of policy based RBAC is familiarity of the policy syntax in the openstack community but it may also limit the use of complex combinations of filters provided by elasticsearch syntax. Optionally we can let plugin developers override the RBAC implementation with their own filters if rules cannot be expressed in a policy file. [TODO] Add policy file representation of the filters Alternatives ------------ To keep using the current plugin code based RBAC implementation.

Refactor the searchlight-ui to use data-binding instead of events where possible.
This results in a set of components that are FAR easier to use, maintain, re-use
and re-organize. This paves the way for future changes that will allow saved
search results, dynamic search table columns and generic search widgets.

At a high-level, this is easiest to understand by looking at the new search-page
directive which contains a sl-magic-search-bar and a search-table. These directives
communicate by using two-way bindings to data on the search-page controller to respond
to changes in the search settings, available facets, current search text and currently
selected facets.

Also, the search table controller no longer uses events in most cases to communicate with
its utility servies like search settings or search helper.

Changes to make it easier to iterate on searchlight-ui including:
- using data binding to communicate between the search results
  and the search input
- using a simple HTML table instead of smart-table

This patch depends on several small Horizon core changes (below).

Introduce a wrapper around magic-search that hides the difficult to
use Magic Search events. This paves the way for a search
table that can use a normal 'table' instead of smart table, and
uses data binding to communicate with magic search.

Use of this new component is demonstrated in a follow-on patch.

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect
rule on releases.openstack.org so that anyone working on this branch
will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when
the requirements repository branches.

Until the requirements repository has as stable/victoria branch, tests will
continue to use the upper-constraints list on master.

Under Elasticsearch 5 we can use the 'ip' type for ipv6 addresses.
This patch detects which server version is running and uses the
appropriate field type.

This adds a configuration parameter 'supports_ipv6' and a check to
make sure the running version seems compatible with it. Doing it all
dynamically is hard at present because the facet code requires the
full mapping, which results in lots of version checks or implementing
caching which is tricky. This options may be able to be removed fairly

As part of Train community goal 'Support IPv6-Only Deployments and Testing'[1],
Tempest has defined the base job 'devstack-tempest-ipv6' which will
deploy services on IPv6.

This commit adds the new job 'searchlight-tempest-ipv6-only'
run on gate which is derived from 'devstack-tempest-ipv6'.

Verification structure will be:
- 'devstack-IPv6' deploy the service on IPv6
- 'devstack-tempest-ipv6' run will verify the IPv6-only setting and listen address
- 'searchlight-tempest-ipv6-only' will install searchlight.

To make overcloud-deploy role support deployment of multiple overcloud
stacks using a single undercloud node - we have generalized the vars
for stack name and removed hardcoding on ""overcloud"" name.

We also created a new playbook which install two overcloud stack -
overcloud and overcloud-two.

we also created j2 version of deploy and post-deploy script for
overcloud-two stack.

Intention is to create a new ci periodic job which test multi overcloud
stack deployment, The new ci job will not be executed upstream but

The previous fix, 589ac8ac0d5a14ce4aa831892d3b0a4a31e29674 was not fully
working as intended because during the templating of the container image
prepare entry, the setting for default_tag was being lost.

This fix simplifies the handling by just checking the initial
mapping_args for the presence of a tag key to determine if the
default_tag flag should be set.

Hacking 4.0.0 has introduce new optimal assert checks.
Please refer [1] for more details.

Additionally Hacking has enabled some new checks by default,
and the next update to the new release will introduce failures
in tacker pep8 jobs.
The main impact is from I122d250cab90964c346e9d53046a97c25054bc00.

This patch addresses following -

* Adopt new optimal assert checks.
 * [H211] Change assertTrue(isinstance(A, B)) to assertIsInstance(A, B).
 * [H212] Change assertEqual(type(A), B) to assertIsInstance(A, B).
 * [H214] Change assertTrue(A not in B, message) to the more specific
   assertNotIn(A, B, message)

* On bumping up the hacking version, below mention pep8 jobs failed.
  This patch address these issues now, when the new hacking release
  starts being used it will not cause a disruption.

ceph-ansible requires the definition of the node exporter
container in all.yml, but at this time, the related variable
is scoped on the Grafana server role only.
If we want to deploy node exporter containers on all the
overcloud nodes (including the CephStorage nodes), it is
needed in the 'all' group and this is especially true if
when operators are not using the default images but satellite.

Currently galera and ovn require a coordinated restart across
the controller node when certmonger determines the certificate
for a node has expired and it needs to regenerate it.

But right now, when the tripleo certmonger puppet module is
called to assert to state of the certificates, it ends up
regenerating new certificate unconditionally. So the galera and
ovn get restarted on stack update, even when there is no need to.

To mitigate these unecessary restarts, disable the post-action
for now until we fix the behaviour of tripleo's certmonger puppet
module. This has the side effect that services won't get restarted
automatically if no stack update takes place until the certificate
expiration date is reached.

Let's just switch to use RpcUserName and make this more consistent.
This is fine, as both RabbitUserName and RpcUserName default to 'guest'
and changing one but not the other is not really feasible in a
deployment.

Tested and a full FFU with TLS-E correctly works now.

The metadata service supports a multicell deployment in a configuration
where the nova-api service implements the metadata API. In this case the
metadata query needs to be cell targeted. This was partly implemented
already. The instance itself is queried from the cell DB properly.
However the BDM data used the non targeted context resulting in an empty

The HAProxy tripleo service currently attempts to generate certificate
specs for all enabled networks which failes on roles that omit some
networks.

For now workaround it by filtering out the bad certificate specs in
puppet-tripleo.
A similar workaround was implemented for apache in
I651919488cb68b0b9878b4e21ab376bfc6e3f0fe.

This change removes the original nova-live-migration job and replaces it
directly with the new Focal based zuulv3 native job.

The nova-dsvm-multinode-base base job is no longer used and so also
removed as part of this change.

Note that this new nova-live-migration job does not yet contain any
ceph coverage like the original, this is still pending and will be
completed early in the W cycle.

This change is being merged ahead of this to resolve bug #1901739, a
known QEMU -drive issue caused by the previous jobs use of libvirt 5.4.0
as provided by Ubuntu Bionic. The fix here being the migration to Ubuntu
Focal based jobs and libvirt 6.0.0 that now defaults to using QEMU
-blockdev.

NOTE(lyarwood): This change squashes the following changes into it to
ensure we end up with a passing zuulv3 Focal based job in
stable/victoria. This includes the reintroduction of
nova-dsvm-multinode-base that was incorrectly removed by this change on
master while still being used.

This patch adds a couple of minor improvements to the existin tests
verifying the selinux labels.

* Adds individual skip checks for tests that require live migration or
resize.
* Creates the server only once for all existing tests.
* Moves the flavor creation request into the only test that actually
requires it, so that it's not repeated for each test.

Before this patch, each test would create a server and destroy it at
the end. Given that none of the existing tests does anything
""destructive"" with the server (resize, migrate), there's no reason why
a single server cannot be reused by all the tests.

There is almost no interested in stein on openSUSE Leap remaining that I
know of, so stop testing it. It won't work on 15.2 with python2. On 15.1
it was working with https://review.opendev.org/#/c/735640/ , but

When connecting an encrypted volume to a host the _attach_encryptor
method will be called in order to either call a legacy os-brick
encryptor *or* configure a libvirt secret used by libvirt and QEMU to
natively decrypt LUKSv1 encrypted volumes. To create this libvirt secret
the configured key manager will be queried to provide and then decode
the associated secret before this is stashed within libvirt.

This change simply skips the above when an existing libvirt secret
associated with the target volume is found on the host already.

While this obviously optimises basic instance lifecycle flows such as a
simple power off and on it additionally resolves a more convoluted use
case when the ``[DEFAULT]/resume_guests_state_on_host_boot``
configurable is enabled. In this case the compute service has no request
context with which to query the key manager when attempting to restart
instances with encrypted volumes attached. As a result any attempt by
the compute service to restart an instance with an attached encrypted
volume would previously fail.

Two functions, 'consume_requests' and 'apply_requests' (via the
'_apply_request' helper), used very similar code to identify the PCI
device pools that could be used to satisfy a request for PCI devices.
Rather than duplicating this code, introduce a new '_filter_pools'
helper than will do this filtering and return a list of matching pools,
if any. This is essentially the old '_apply_request' function without
any decreasing of pool count information.

While we're here, we inline a simple function with a single caller and
add whitespace to make things a little easier to grok.

The ping test starts at the beginning of the ""update run"" phase and
stops after it finishes. This means after all roles has been updated.

With this patch we stop, test and restart the ping in-between each
role update.

This means:

 1. that we detect error earlier;
 2. we detect error related to new flow being created during update
    run;

The point 2. was discovered to be an important test as ovn can have
existing flow still working, but new flow breaking. With this new
behavior for the ping test we catch such error.

The downside is that we have even more sensible to any % based testing
as the same number of error will give you an higher percentage as we
spend less time in the test for each run. This could be seen as
another improvement.

We're splitting the ping test into two stages so that if the ping
fails to start (as it would be for this particular issue) we would
detect it immediately instead of waiting for the end of the run.

When we doing batch update (all roles in parallel) we deactivate that
mechanism and fall back to the previous one as there is no in-between
role step there.

We also prevent the stop ping from searching into all home
subdirectory as I had an issue in local testing where one subdirectory
had unreadable files (after a local podman run). This shouldn't happen
in CI, but is good to have for local testing.

first network in the network_data.yaml definition.

When converting multi-nic templates to ansible
the ordering contract between network_data.yaml
and the nicX for each network was broken because
iteration happens only over networks associated
with the role.

This change restores the ordering contract in
the multi-nic templates by iterating over the
'networks_all' group_var which holds all enabled
networks in the order of apperance in
network_data.yaml.

This patch adds support for two new options in barbican.conf for the
PKCS#11 backend plugin:  [p11_crypto]token_label and
[p11_crypto]token_serial_number by adding two new parameters
to the Barbican deployment BarbicanPkcs11CryptoTokenSerialNumber
and BarbicanPkcs11CryptoTokenLabel.

This patch also simplifies the use of barbican-manage to generate
the MKEK and PKEK in the HSM backend by using the values provided
in barbican.conf instead of duplicating them on the command line.

For the Thales Luna Network device, this patch uses the label
parameters to identify the partition to be used.  Because we are
using labels we no longer need to write the runtime generated
Slot ID of the HA group into hieradata.

Since [0] was merged propagate_uplink_status value is True,
tempest (and neutron-tempest-plugin) is branchless, so
test_create_port_without_propagate_uplink_status and
test_create_port_with_propagate_uplink_status can be moved to
fullstack tests to keep the coverage.

Issues:
- On ussuri the default value for propagate_uplink_status was False, so
the test_create_port_without_propagate_uplink_status test asserts False.

- On train there is no dhcp_scheduler_class attribute for

- On stein EnvironmentDescription has no has_placement & placement_port
attributes, and the related logic.

tl;dr Just issuing reboot may not power off the node in some
drivers and the node may have hung if it is stuck in post.

commit updates it to use a new version that seems to be free of the

This updates lower constraints to versions that will work with py38 so
that when we move to running on focal nodes, which has py38 as its
default py3 runtime, the lower-constraints job will continue to pass.

It also cleans out some secondary requirements that are no longer needed
due to our direct dependencies being updated.

Linters are removed that are kept in the global requirements blacklist
as those are not version tracked and are not relevant for our
lower-constraints unit test runs.

When the OVN Octavia Provider driver calls into
octavia-lib to update the status of a loadbalancer,
it might fail. This can happen if a resource associated
with the loadbalancer was not found, for example, if
it's DB transaction was in-flight.

A side-effect is the resource can become ""stuck"":

$ openstack loadbalancer listener delete $ID
Load Balancer $ID is immutable and cannot be updated.

The provider driver needs to retry the operation,
typically even the very next call succeeds.

the heat devstack plugin is fixed on all stable branches
(currently broken due to the usage of an older Fedora image which
doesn't exist anymore, see Id869f83a46454897c2fe7a532eebfa2863befe5e),
so disable it.

This reverts commit dc25776f630bfc9e90965a6d3c7e8d23aec8232c.

Reason for revert: With the patch overridden dlrn_hash_tag_newest will
not work, also the actual issue seems due to mirror sync so let's use
non mirror urls to get hash and fallback to mirror ones.

The API list methods were not handling unscoped tokens correctly.
If the API is using the admin_or_owner-policy.yaml policy override file,
and a user used an unscoped token, the API will list objects for all
projects. This patch corrects that issue.
If you are using the default policies, the API handles unscoped tokens
correctly.

This change makes updates to support HA as well as manila-ganesha application
renaming.

The manila-ganesha charm supports active/passive HA. This is done by
co-locating manila-share and nfs-ganesha systemd services on the same unit,
and ensuring that those services are only running on the master unit with
the VIP. Once an HA deployment is complete, pacemaker will ensure that only
one unit is running the services.

If a second unit starts the services while the first is connected to CephFS,
the first will be evicted and its session state corrupted.

This patch ensures that the services are disabled/stopped until the HA
cluster setup is complete. This patch also overrides service_(re)start
methods so that they cooperate with pacemaker. Both of these changes
prevent a second unit from starting services while the first is connected
to CephFS. For example, if charm config is changed, services will only be
restarted on the master unit where they were running prior to the config
change.

Once HA setup is complete, pacemaker will ensure that only one unit has
running services. However, there is still a risk that a systemd service is
restarted manually by a user or other means, therefore the README is
updated to describe this situation.

This change also ensures that cluster_connected is called with necessary
gating rather than on every hook execution.

This change also removes some hard-coding in the charm that prevented the
charm from working if the application name was changed to something other
than manila-ganesha.

Finally, test bundles are updated to run clustered with hacluster and renamed
application name.

- Add a checker of version using the method ping()
if it failes, maybe because of an old version,
the flow will try with SHOW DIAGNOSTICS.

- Keep the timestamp output to 3 decimal digits as
it is working currently, independently of the version
of Influx Python Client (v5.2.3 or v5.3.1).

- Remove the support for Influxdb (the database)
older than v0.11.0

- Unittests: Adding data to handle more than 3 decimal
digits in timestamp, updating the tests to use mocks
for Influxdb from_0.11.0, creating the mocks with
from_0.11.0 explicitly.

- This change fixes monasca-tempest-python3-influxdb
Zuul job.

It removed more than the deprecated param, breaking the pci config on
computes.
Also should have warned for at least 1 cycle before removal.
It also wasn't removed correctly as the pick remained in nova::compute::pci
so (IIUC) the deprecated param still works today if set in hieradata.

This reverts commit d845b6f0aefaaab0b65b32cd22ccda8c2c8ee6ae.

They assume a working Rabbit and MySQL server before the run starts. Instructions on how to run fullstack tests on a VM are available below. Each test defines its own topology (What and how many servers and agents should be running). Since the test runs on the machine itself, full stack testing enables ""white box"" testing. This means that you can, for example, create a router through the API and then assert that a namespace was created for it. Full stack tests run in the Neutron tree with Neutron resources alone. You may use the Neutron API (The Neutron server is set to NOAUTH so that Keystone is out of the picture). VMs may be simulated with a container-like class: neutron.tests.fullstack.resources.machine.FakeFullstackMachine. An example of its usage may be found at: neutron/tests/fullstack/test_connectivity.py. Full stack testing can simulate multi node testing by starting an agent multiple times. Specifically, each node would have its own copy of the OVS/LinuxBridge/DHCP/L3 agents, all configured with the same ""host"" value. Each OVS agent is connected to its own pair of br-int/br-ex, and those bridges are then interconnected. For LinuxBridge agent each agent is started in its own namespace, called ""host-<some_random_value>"". Such namespaces are connected with OVS ""central"" bridge to each other. .. image:: images/fullstack_multinode_simulation.png Segmentation at the database layer is guaranteed by creating a database per test. The messaging layer achieves segmentation by utilizing a RabbitMQ feature called 'vhosts'. In short, just like a MySQL server serve multiple databases, so can a RabbitMQ server serve multiple messaging domains. Exchanges and queues in one 'vhost' are segmented from those in another 'vhost'. Please note that if the change you would like to test using fullstack tests involves a change to python-neutronclient as well as neutron, then you should make sure your fullstack tests are in a separate third change that depends on the python-neutronclient change using the 'Depends-On' tag in the commit message. You will need to wait for the next release of python-neutronclient, and a minimum version bump for python-neutronclient in the global requirements, before your fullstack tests will work in the gate. This is because tox uses the version of python-neutronclient listed in the upper-constraints.txt file in the openstack/requirements repository. When? +++++ 1) You'd like to test the interaction between Neutron components (Server and agents) and have already tested each component in isolation via unit or functional tests. You should have many unit tests, fewer tests to test a component and even fewer to test their interaction. Edge cases should not be tested with full stack testing. 2) You'd like to increase coverage by testing features that require multi node testing such as l2pop, L3 HA and DVR. 3) You'd like to test agent restarts. We've found bugs in the OVS, DHCP and L3 agents and haven't found an effective way to test these scenarios. Full stack testing can help here as the full stack infrastructure can restart an agent during the test. Example +++++++ Neutron offers a Quality of Service API, initially offering bandwidth capping at the port level. In the reference implementation, it does this by utilizing an OVS feature. neutron.tests.fullstack.test_qos.TestBwLimitQoSOvs.test_bw_limit_qos_policy_rule_lifecycle is a positive example of how the fullstack testing infrastructure should be used. It creates a network, subnet, QoS policy & rule and a port utilizing that policy. It then asserts that the expected bandwidth limitation is present on the OVS bridge connected to that port. The test is a true integration test, in the sense that it invokes the API and then asserts that Neutron interacted with the hypervisor appropriately.",254,89

In Ussuri and earlier releases, the Bifrost custom inventory returns all
node fields as facts. Currently, most of these are returned as null.
This happened following the switch to openstacksdk. The plugin checks
for the presence of a properties field, and gets detailed node
information if it is missing. This worked with shade, but with
openstacksdk, the returned node object has most fields present but set
to null.

One of the most obvious consequences is that provisioning fails, since
the 'Deploy to hardware - Using custom instance_info.' task tries to use
the instance_info value of null.

This change fixes the issue by removing the check and always getting the
detailed node information.

Multiple python-tripleoclient commands can run concurrently

(squashing commits as the 1st patch is failing in the stein gate without

Ensure atomic inventory file rename runs on the same mountpoint

Linux rename system call is only supported on the same mountpoint [1].
/tmp is often a tmpfs mount, so instead generate the temp inventory file in
the same directory as the target inventory file.

removes these parameters from integration_tests/pages/navigation.py
file.

OVS agent is a single threaded process with several eventlet threads
listening to RPC messages. During the polling cycle, the green thread
executing this code should not return or give the execution token to
other thread. Any other thread attending to RPC messages or OVSDB
events will be attended but should be processed at the end of the
cycle.

This patch removes a sleep introduced in the middle of a OF creation
and forces to have a sleep (even with time 0) at the end of the
polling cycle.

This approach works if used in a controlled single user environment, but can be improved to work in more functional environments Problem description =================== Tempest cleanup uses a snapshot of the current build called a saved_state. Any resource not in the saved state will be deleted once tempest cleanup is run. In the case of a single user on a single node, this makes sense, but if cleanup were used in an environment where multiple people are working on a multi-node project issues become readily apparent. Ex1: Tenant A saves state, tenant B adds a resource, tenant A runs tests, tenant A cleans up after tests, tenant B's resource gets cleaned up because it does not appear in the saved_state.json. Ex2: Tenant A saves state, tenant A runs tests, tenant B saves state, tenant B runs tests, tenant A cleans up - Some test A elements are in the saved state from tenant B, and cleanup removes resources created in test B. Proposed change =============== I would like to invite anyone interested to join my discussion on etherpad: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/tempest-smart-cleanup There are a few proposed fixes for this problem and I would appreciate more input. Please feel free to +1 ideas, add to the pros and cons, or add your own approach. Update: The current proposal with the most pros and fewest cons is: Add a logging/output function to tempest test base to track what resources are being added and where. This list would be used in a new function tempest cleanup --smart that would remove resources according to the new black list rather than follow the saved_state white list.

Problem description =================== We need to test High Availability of OpenStack services and check how OpenStack services will work in case of any destructive scenarios. Such tests allow to verify that OpenStack cluster will stay alive in case of any destructive scenarios (like shutdown of nodes, restart of network switches, restart of some OpenStack services, DB / RabbitMQ downtime and etc). What we want to check and cover with these tests: - How Openstack cluster behaves in case of some destructive scenarios? - Will the cluster alive if we lose some nodes / services? - Check the proper work of auto-healing scripts / pacemaker / OCF and etc. - Verify some OpenStack features which require shutdown / restart of nodes / services. .. todo:: Add Destructive/HA/fail-over test scenarios Follow the Timur's mail to ML, ""[openstack-dev] [Openstack-operators] Destructive / HA / fail-over scenarios"". Proposed change =============== Add new repository with framework to provide High Availability, destructive, failover, and recovery testing for control plane. Add test cases based on its framework. Alternatives ------------ .. todo:: Add overview of other exisiting tools, `HA Failure Test <https://github.com/avdhoot07/HA-Failure-TEST>`_ `Cloud99 <https://github.com/cisco-oss-eng/Cloud99>`_ Add how Stepler is a better solution than the above. Implementation ============== The test solution (framework) architecture should be based on STEPS-methodology, that considers a test as a sequence of steps. Each of steps ends with it's own check, that step was finished correct. It allows to compose plenty of tests, having moderate codebase. This framework should use os-faults library [1] to manage the nodes and networking switches (shutdown, run bash commands, restart services and etc.). .. todo:: Add os-fault details here( Luz's comment on L55 #399618) Architecture should have the following abstraction levels of codebase (from higher to less): - clients are able to manipulate resources: users, roles, servers, etc. For ex: keystone client, nova client, node client, etc. - steps are actions, that we want to make over resources via clients: create, delete, update, migrate, etc. They should end with check, that step was finished correct. - fixtures manage resources construction, destruction, etc via steps. - tests combine steps and fixtures according to scenario. .. todo:: Add Luz's comment on L65 #399618) Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: * Sampath Priyankara (samP at IRC) * Timur Nurlygayanov (tnurlygayanov@mirantis.com) * Sergei Chipiga (schipiga@mirantis.com) Mandatory design reviewers: * Dina Belova (Mirantis, DinaBelova at IRC) * Luz Cazares (luzC at IRC) * Ken'ichi Ohmichi (oomichi at IRC) Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: Pike2 Work Items ---------- - Create the repository for the new framework - Create the core of the framework - Add destructive and failover test scenarios References ========== [0] Etherpad from design session at Barcelona https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/ocata-qa-destructive-testing [1] OS faults library https://github.com/openstack/os-faults ",,116,0

This patch is a complement of [1] which we ensure
a fresh lb object, but only for AmpListenersUpdate
class.

It was observed, at least on train and ussuri
deployments that multiple failed amphoras were still
happening when using session persistence.

That is fixed and failover works flawless with session
persistence when we also ensure a fresh lb object on
