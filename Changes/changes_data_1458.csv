cinder-backup service is optional, and there are valid deployment
scenarios where it is not needed, e.g. there's no available
appropriately 'external' storage to put backups to.

For a non-privileged cloud user, there's currently no proper way
to find out if cinder-backup service is actually enabled
through the cinder API alone.
For example, the user may still attempt to create a backup from the
volume, with request being accepted, but later just stuck in scheduling.

This patch adds a NoOp API class for backups, that will raise a new
BackupServiceNotEnabled exception on all of its public methods,
which in turn will translate to HTTP 404 API response with
an approprate message.
Deployers who intentionally do not deploy cinder-backup service
may now configure this class as

backup_api_class = cinder.backup.api.NoOp

to clearly signal their users that there's no such capability in this
given cloud.

OAuth2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow is prescribed in the API specification of ETSI `NFV-SOL013 v3.3.1`_. Tacker uses the keystone middleware to support OAuth2.0 Client Credentials Grant through the third-party authorization server. In addition, Tacker can also via the Client Credentials Grant flow in `RFC6749`_ OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework access other OpenStack services that use the third-party authentication servers for user authentication. Preparations ~~~~~~~~~~~~ To use external OAuth2.0 authorization server for Tacker, it is necessary to confirm that the token filter factory ``external_oauth2_token`` is supported in the keystone middleware. In this example, the `keycloak`_ server is used as the third-party authorization server, and keycloak.host is the domain name used by the `keycloak`_ server, and the domain name used by the Tacker server is tacker.host. Guide ~~~~~ To use external OAuth2.0 authorization server for Tacker, you should configure the tacker-server and the Keystone middleware in the following steps. .. _RFC6749: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749 .. _keycloak: https://www.keycloak.org/ .. _NFV-SOL013 v3.3.1: https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SOL/001_099/013/03.03.01_60/gs_nfv-sol013v030301p.pdf Enable To Use External OAuth2.0 Authorization Server ---------------------------------------------------- To handle API requests using external OAuth2.0 authorization server authorization you have to configure the keystone middleware which intercepts API calls from clients and verifies a client's identity, see `Middleware Architecture`_. 1. Add ``keystonemiddleware.external_oauth2_token:filter_factory`` to the configuration file ``api-paste.ini`` to enable External OAuth2.0 Authorization Server Authorization. .. code-block:: console $ vi /etc/tacker/api-paste.ini [composite:tackerapi_v1_0] keystone = request_id catch_errors alarm_receiver external_oauth2_token keystonecontext extensions tackerapiapp_v1_0 [composite:vnfpkgmapi_v1] keystone = request_id catch_errors external_oauth2_token keystonecontext vnfpkgmapp_v1 [composite:vnflcm_v1] keystone = request_id catch_errors external_oauth2_token keystonecontext vnflcmaapp_v1 [composite:vnflcm_v2] keystone = request_id catch_errors external_oauth2_token keystonecontext vnflcmaapp_v2 [composite:vnflcm_versions] keystone = request_id catch_errors external_oauth2_token keystonecontext vnflcm_api_versions [filter:external_oauth2_token] paste.filter_factory = keystonemiddleware.external_oauth2_token:filter_factory 2. Modify the configuration file ``tacker.conf`` to enable keystone middleware to access the external OAuth2.0 authorization server to verify the token and enable Tacker to get an access token through the external OAuth2.0 authorization server to access other OpenStack services. If the external OAuth2.0 authorization server requires HTTPS communication, you need to set the config parameters ``cafile`` and ``insecure``. When the certificate specified in the config parameter ``cafile`` needs to be used for authentication, the config parameter ``insecure`` needs to set True. If the config parameter ``cafile`` is not required or the certificate specified by the config parameter ``cafile`` is not used for authentication, the config parameter ``insecure`` must be set to False. If the external OAuth2.0 authorization server requires mTLS communication, you need to set the config parameters ``certfile``, ``keyfile`` and ``cafile``. If the config parameter ``thumbprint_verify`` is set to true, you need to refer to the `OAuth2.0 mTLS usage guide`_ to enable mTLS for Tacker. Users accessing the Tacker APIs must use the same client certificate that they used when obtaining an access token from the external OAuth2.0 authorization server. It is also necessary to ensure that the information about the access token obtained through the Introspect API includes the client certificate thumbprint information. For the field ``cnf/x5t#S256`` used to store the thumbprint of the client certificate, see the subsequent sample. In order to ensure that Tacker can correctly obtain user information, such as Project ID, User ID, Roles, etc., it is necessary to set the config parameters that starts with ``mapping`` and ensure that all access tokens contain data that conforms to the specified format. If the config parameter ``use_ext_oauth2_auth`` is set to true, Tacker APIs will obtain an access token from the external OAuth2.0 authorization server and then access other OpenStack services such as Barbican. If the config parameter ``use_ext_oauth2_auth`` is set to false, Tacker APIs will keep the original logic, get an x-auth-token from the keystone identity server, and then access the other OpenStack services. Currently, five methods are supported: ``client_secret_basic``, ``client_secret_post``, ``private_key_jwt``, ``client_secret_jwt``, and ``tls_client_auth``, as detailed below: client_secret_basic: When the external OAuth2.0 authorization server requires to use the mTLS protocol and the ``client_secret_basic`` authentication method, and the Tacker APIs requires to use mTLS, the following configuration is performed: .. code-block:: console [DEFAULT] use_ssl=True ssl_ca_file=/etc/tacker/multi_ca.pem ssl_cert_file=/etc/tacker/tacker_host.pem ssl_key_file=/etc/tacker/tacker_host.key

Access the Tacker APIs with the OAuth2.0 access token to confirm that OAuth2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow works correctly. The current Tacker APIs can receive OAuth2.0 access tokens obtained through the following 5 methods: ``client_secret_basic``, ``client_secret_post``, ``private_key_jwt``, ``client_secret_jwt``, and ``tls_client_auth``. Different external OAuth2.0 authorization servers will have different methods to obtain OAuth2.0 access tokens. The following example is only applicable to scenarios where `keycloak`_ is used as the OAuth2.0 authentication server. client_secret_basic: When the `keycloak`_ server requires to use the mTLS protocol and the ``client_secret_basic`` authentication method, The following example is used to get an access token and use the access token to access Tacker APIs. .. code-block:: console $ curl -i

To debug storage related issues it is very helpful to actually see the
requests made to Cinder.

This patch asks the cinderclient to log HTTP requests when global debug
or cinder specific debug is enabled.

There is a cinderclient bug [1] that prevents this option from working
when called by the Nova code because it is being ignored.

This change updates the default policies implemented in Heat, to follow
the updated guideline[1] to implement SRBAC.

The main change is that system users are no longer allowed to perform
any operations about project-level resources like stacks, while project
admin(*1) is still allowed to perform operations about project-level
resources BEYOND project (like getting stacks for all projects by list
stacks API).

This also adds the test cases to validate reader role which was almost

(*1)
If Keystone has an admin project defined, Heat checks an additional
requirement that request context is scoped by that admin project.

Initially Ubuntu/Debian used /var/run/openvswitch as default OVN run dir,

OVN DB refactor.

Adding in OVN and OVN upgrade Debian jobs to enhance coverage.

This is the first release of Ironic that, along with OpenStack, supports SLURP (Skip Level Upgrade Release Process), allowing operators to upgrade directly from Zed to Bobcat (2023.2). Operators who are upgrading from Antelope (2023.1) or an intermediate Ironic bugfix release should be aware that this document contains the full year of release notes. Our focus this cycle has been on improving the ability for operators to secure and service their Ironic nodes. There are also, as always, a myriad of quality of life fixes, including improvements to sqlite support and graceful shutdown of conductors. We hope the latest release of Ironic serves you well!

Error-handling includes Retry, Rollback and Fail operations. * For the fail operation, it will not perform LCM when it is executed, so there is no need to use MgmtDriver. * For the retry operation, it will perform the LCM again when it is executed, so as long as the LCM is configured with MgmtDriver, the MgmtDriver will also be called during the retry operation, and no additional configuration is required. * For the rollback operation, because there is no definition of ``rollback_start`` and ``rollback_end`` in ``6.7 Interface Types`` of `NFV-SOL001 v3.3.1`_, so when the rollback operation is performed, MgmtDriver will not be called. The VNFD in the VNF Package must be modified before calling MgmtDriver in the rollback operation. .. note:: In the MgmtDriver, the user saves the data that needs to be kept when the LCM fails in the ``user_script_err_handling_data`` variable. It is saved in the corresponding VNF_LCM_OP_OCC, and can be viewed through `Show VNF LCM OP OCC`_. During error-handling (retry or rollback), use the data in the ``user_script_err_handling_data`` variable to perform corresponding processing. Modifications of VNF Package ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Users need to make the following modifications when creating a `VNF Package`_. The rollback operation currently supports multiple `LCM operations`_. The following takes the rollback operations of instantiate and scale-out as examples to demonstrate how to modify VNFD. .. note:: The following provides the sample files ``v2_sample2_df_simple.yaml`` and ``v2_sample2_types.yaml`` that need to be modified, which are stored in the Definitions directory of the VNF Package. * ``v2_sample2_df_simple.yaml`` corresponds to `Topology Template Files`_ in VNFD. * ``v2_sample2_types.yaml`` corresponds to `User defined types definition file`_ in VNFD. * In ``v2_sample2_df_simple.yaml``, ``xxx_rollback_start`` and ``xxx_rollback_end`` need to be added under ``topology_template.node_templates.VNF.interfaces.Vnflcm``.

When heal all(all=true) is executed, the stack id will be updated.
Once the stack id is not saved in vnf_instance, it will cause an
exception.
In this patch, in heal and terminate, if the stack id does not
exist, use the stack name instead to call the heat api.

Modified the logic in attach volume and detach volume.
Now the functions use CLI command to attach or detach volume.

Fix error when detaching fujistu multiattached volume on same host.
When detaching multiattached volume from one instance, connection is
deleted on the host so that other instances with same volume can
not use volume.
When large than 1, do not terminate connection.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =============================== Compliance testcases for tacker =============================== Purpose of compliance testcases is to verify various functionality of tacker api by using NFV TST code. From tacker home directory, testcases are located attacker/tests/compliance Writing a testcase:A testcase is written by declaring a class name derived from class BaseVNFLifecycleManagementTest(base.BaseComplSolTest). BaseComplSolTest is class declared in tacker/tests/compliance/sol003/base.py. A testcase body typically looks as below: .. code-block:: python class VNFInstancesTest(BaseVNFLifecycleManagementTest): @classmethod def setUpClass(cls): cls.resource = 'VNFInstances' super(VNFInstancesTest, cls).setUpClass() def test_post_create_new_vnfinstance(self): //Testcase operations //validations or asserts //cleanup In above example test class 'VNFInstancesTest' is derived from BaseVNFLifecycleManagementTest. Testcases typically has sections to setup, test, validate results and finally cleanup. Input yaml files: These are input files used in testcases for operations like create vnfd or create vnf. The location of files is tacker/tests/etc/samples/. requirements.txt and test-requirements.txt : The file requirements.txt and test-requirements.txt lists all the packages needed for compliance test. These packages are installed during devstack installation. If there are any new packages needed for compliance test make sure they are added in test-requirements.txt. Asserting values in testcase: The base class BaseTackerTest inherits base.TestCase which has inbuild assert functions which can be used in testcase. Eg: assertIsNotNone, assertEqual Tacker-client: In tacker/tests/compliance/base.py tackerclient object is instantiated which has apis to create/delete/list vnfd/vnf once given the necessary parameters.Verify tackerclient/v1_0/client.py for all the tacker related apis supported. Important guidelines to follow: =============================== * Install test-requirements.txt with below command: .. code-block:: console pip install -r test-requirements.txt * It is important that the test case executed leaves the system in the same state it was prior to test case execution and not leave any stale data on system as this might affect other test cases. * There should not be any dependencies between testcases which assume one testcase should be executed and be passed for second testcase. * Testcases in tox environment may be executed in parallel. The order in which the testcases are executed may vary between two environments. * The code added should meet pep8 standards. This can be verified with following command and ensuring the code does not return any errors. .. code-block:: console tox -e pep8 Execution of testcase: ====================== * Install tacker server via devstack installation, which registers tacker service and endpoint, creates ""nfv_user"" and ""nfv"" project, and registers default VIM with the created user and project. * From tacker directory, all function testcases can be executed using following commands: .. code-block:: console tox -e dsvm-compliance-sol-api * Or from tacker directory, specific testcases can be executed using following commands: .. code-block:: console tox -e dsvm-compliance-sol-api tacker.tests.compliance.xxx.yyy.<testcase> * Note: Need to clean environment for re-execution of test. Terminate and delete the VNF created while executing the tests. .. code-block:: console openstack vnflcm terminate <vnf_id> openstack vnflcm delete <vnf_id> Committing testcase and opening a review: ========================================= * Once testcase is added in local setup, commit the testcase and open for review using below guidelines: https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html Sample testcase: ================ * Check sample tests under following directory: https://opendev.org/openstack/tacker/src/branch/master/tacker/tests/compliance/ ",,134,0

This allows switching between NFS protocol helpers
that the driver currently supports and avoids
unnecessary ensuring of driver resources on restarts
unless a small set of config opts are toggled.

Use of either NFS protocol helper in the driver
will trigger access rules to be reapplied when
ensuring shares.

This patch adds initial support for configuring the network via
NetworkManager instead of writing ifcfg files. The NetworkManager
API used is nmstate, which is a python library/tool providing a
declarative configuration for NetworkManager through JSON/YAML.

Note that this is a work in progress, not a finished
solution. impl_nmstate was based off of impl_ifcfg. The code
has been changed to support the new API in version 1.x of
nmstate. Testing must be done on CentOS Stream, RHEL 9 beta,
or installation from source (which also requires a new version
of nispor Python libraries).

This code is largely functional, but OVS bridge configuration
is not yet functional and a future patchset should be ready to
merge.

This is an internal change in the share manager's
""ensure_driver_resources"" method, and isn't invoked
by any code path yet. The idea is to allow drivers
to opt into running ""update_access"" on shares that
they are ensuring.

Only drivers that implement ""ensure_shares"" can
take advantage of this feature.

Downstream packages (e.g. ubuntu) of ceph are not yet all up-to-date
even though the requisite changes in ceph git repos have been
backported all the way to luminous, the earliest ceph version supported
in manila.

So gracefully handle the situation where an old version of ceph is
deployed that cannot handle setting mode on volume and snapshot
creates, and on group operations.

Note that CentOS and RHOSP and SUSE packages have been updated and
Kevin Carter is raising a LP issue for ubuntu so we may not have a
need for this one.  Ceph community would like to encourage customers
to update if they hit the issue.

If we do go ahad then we'd need to make corresponding changes for the
other operations than volume creation, add some unit tests that throw,
the TypeError, and of course add a release note.

Nova has the ability of individually setting debug mode for cinder
related libraries (cinderclient and os-brick) and for glanceclient using
their respective configuration sections and setting `debug = true`
regardless of the default debug setting.

Unfortunately these options don't work as expected and have no effect.

The reason is that we are setting the default log levels based on the
configuration before we have even loaded the configuration, so the
cinder.debug and glance.debug options will always have the default value
of `False`.

This patch alters the order of setting the defaults to after we have
loaded the configuration options.

When there is a load failure on the load_validators method we get an
unexpected error:

  AttributeError: 'EntryPoint' object has no attribute 'module_name'

That is because the importlib's EntryPoint has no 'module_name'
attribute.

I don't know if in the past it had a 'module_name' attribute or not, but
right now the module name is stored as the 'module' attribute.

This patch tries the old and the new attribute name to fix the issue.

Currently StoredContext object tries to load auth plugin even when
a specific property(eg. user_domain_id) is already set. However this
is redundant and we can use the value loaded from stack instead.

Backport note:
This change omits the change about GLOBAL_VENV parameter in devstack
because the parameter was added after 2023.1 release.

Also, this contains change Ie0876080c771fb124d4dd36f803fbfd3b108e240
because Fedora 36 image is being removed from some mirrors.

The maintenance worker from the neutron-api uses a southbound
connection. Since the southbound does not use any locking and all the
ovsdb locking is used for the northbound this changes should not have a
big impact.

This commit removes the leader_only flag for the maintenance worker.
This should also enable the neutron api to connect to relays instead of only
the sb directly.

This patch is prompted by the following deprecation warning:

DeprecationWarning: Use setlocale(), getencoding() and getlocale() instead

But getdefaultlocale() is scheduled to be removed in Python

This feature, primarily targeted at orchestration of DPUs, allows nodes to have parent/child relationships. This allows for more complex logic to be coordinated between a node and its children. When a node with children runs a step-based action, those steps can include actions to be run on the child node. See `parent node documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/cleaning.html#parent-nodes>`_ for more information. - Ironic now has basic support for serviving nodes in ``ACTIVE`` state. Service Steps allows operators to use steps to perform service on deployed nodes similarly to how they are used during deployment and cleaning. Previously, Ironic would not perform operations on active nodes. See `Node servicing documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/servicing>`_ for more information. - Additional steps have been added to enable operators to control the flow of the automated process. The first new step, ``wait``, which waits for a specified amount of time or until the next heartbeat. The second new step, ``hold``, stops evaluation of steps until the ``unhold`` verb is submitted to the provision state API for that node. When a node is held, it will be parked a new ""hold"" provision_state, either ``clean hold``, ``deploy hold`` or ``service hold``. These new steps are useful for integrating with external systems that need to perform actions on a node or for orchestrating complex workflows involving child nodes. - Additional steps have been added to enable operators to perform basic out of band power operations on nodes. The ``power_off``, ``power_on``, and ``reboot`` names have been reserved for internal Ironic use. If used as a step name, Ironic will perform the corresponding power operation on the node. - Conductors can now be restarted with less impact on nodes with an operation in progress by now honoring the value of ``[DEFAULT]/graceful_shutdown_timeout``. Operators can set this to the number of seconds their conductors have to complete operations in progress. Previously, all in-progress operations would fail regardless of the value of this setting. - Ironic deployers can now set separate defaults, by CPU architecture, for configuration of kernel and ramdisk for deploy and rescue operations. These new settings, ``[conductor]/deploy_kernel_by_arch``, ``[conductor]/deploy_ramdisk_by_arch``, ``[conductor]/rescue_kernel_by_arch``, and ``[conductor]/rescue_ramdisk_by_arch`` are replacements for the existing configuration options ``[conductor]/deploy_kernel``, ``[conductor]/deploy_ramdisk``, ``[conductor]/rescue_kernel``, and ``[conductor]/rescue_ramdisk``, which are now deprecated for removal. - Operators are now able to disable MD5 use in Ironic. A new configuration option, ``[agent]/allow_md5_checksum`` has been added to allow operators to instruct Ironic-Python-Agent versions newer than 9.4.0 if MD5 is a permitted algorithm for checksums. This option defaults to ``true`` to preserve existing behavior.",,48,0

This option is required for server-side encryption to be allowed
if radosgw is behind a reverse proxy,
such as here when certificates are configured and apache2 is running.

ref. https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/radosgw/encryption/

It is safe to always enable when https is configured in the charm,
because it will be securely behind the reverse proxy in the unit.
This option must not be enabled when https is not configured in the charm,
because this would allow clients to spoof headers.

We agreed last cycle on the support envelope.
Pre-RC1, we need to add a service version in the object.
Post-RC1, depending on whether it's SLURP or not SLURP, we need to bump

This patch only focuses on pre-RC1 stage.

When enabling heartbeat_in_pthread, we were restoring the ""threading""
python library from eventlet to original one in RabbitDriver but we
forgot to do the same in AMQPDriverBase (RabbitDriver is subclass of
AMQPDriverBase).

We also need to use the original ""queue"" so that queues are not going to
use greenthreads as well.

Driver-powered share backups will extend this feature in future releases. - | Added new Manila drivers to support Dell PowerFlex and Dell PowerStore storage backends. The driver for PowerFlex supports managing NFS shares while the driver for PowerStore supports managing NFS and CIFS shares. - | Added the NetAppAIQWeigher scheduler weigher that harnesses artificial intelligence to handle provisioning and placement decisions. - | Share access rules can be filtered with rule parameters such as access_to, access_type, access_key and access_level. - | Added the possibility to display the total count of snapshots when paginating snapshots. - | Added share type information to notifications with oslo.messaging. It is useful for billing to be able to charge customers differently for shares of different types. - | Administrators are now able to to set a maximum share extend size restriction which can be set on a per share-type granularity through the ‘provisioning:max_share_extend_size’ extra-spec. - | Usage of the “manila” CLI client is discouraged in favor of the “openstack” CLI.

This reverts commit 7ed79c1f7890456488a4b44769ed84fea23c9a39.

Reason for revert: the port binding handling done in this patch is
incorrect and leads to issues during the cold migration process with
trunk ports in ML2/OVN.

Previously token cache was not correctly handling the case when data
in memcached is un-decryptable.
The cache process was returning a null value that was not considered
resulting a python exception raised

The commit fixes the issue by adding a condition to validate the value
returned.

This reverts commit 744d364141a8efc10590367a5071eebf34bb0827.

Reason for revert: the port binding handling done in this patch is
incorrect and leads to issues during the cold migration process with
trunk ports in ML2/OVN.

It makes sense to copy user-meta, but sysmeta; I think it was just an
accident left over form when we tried to support COPY in the
proxy-server and middlewares wouldn't have had the chance to fix
sysmeta.

But that's a long since un-needed behavior and I think the fact that
copying sysmeta from the source object doesn't cause more problems than
you might expect is just because mostly middlewares and EC are pretty
stict about validating/fixing any sysmeta they want WRT to whatever
sysmeta header value might have unexpectedly come in with the request.

The maintenance worker from the neutron-api uses a southbound
connection. Since the southbound does not use any locking and all the
ovsdb locking is used for the northbound this changes should not have a
big impact.

This commit removes the leader_only flag for the maintenance worker.
This should also enable the neutron api to connect to relays instead of only
the sb directly.

Option `hw_firwmare_type=uefi` might create _unbootable_

because SMM requires `q35`, thus fails to boot on `pc`.

So, check for non-`q35` machine, and prefer other loaders.

If it's the only loader available, well, log that and try.

Why stable-only and not cherry-picks?

Wallaby and later are fixed with refactoring, as part of
the Secure Boot implementation, but that's big/risky; see
commit 9fff6893ce2e (""libvirt: Use firmware metadata files
to configure instance"").

That removed the hardcoded paths from commit 363710b65543
(""libvirt: Handle alternative UEFI firmware binary paths"").

Test Steps:

    $ openstack image set --property hw_firmware_type=uefi $image
    $ openstack server create --image $image --flavor $flavor --network $network $server

Before:

    $ virsh dumpxml $guest | grep -e machine= -e loader
        <type arch='x86_64' machine='pc-i440fx-4.2'>hvm</type>
        <loader readonly='yes' type='pflash'>/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.secboot.fd</loader>

    $ openstack console log show $server # empty; it doesn't boot!
    $

After:

    $ virsh dumpxml $guest | grep -e machine= -e loader
        <type arch='x86_64' machine='pc-i440fx-4.2'>hvm</type>
        <loader readonly='yes' type='pflash'>/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd</loader>

    $ openstack console log show $server # yay, it boots!
    ...
    [    0.000000] efi: EFI v2.70 by EDK II
    ...

Note that the XML snippet for the loader is aligned with Wallaby,
in which just setting hw_firmware_type=uefi works out of the box:

    $ virsh dumpxml $guest | grep -e machine= -e loader
      <type arch='x86_64' machine='pc-i440fx-4.2'>hvm</type>
      <loader readonly='yes' secure='no' type='pflash'>/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd</loader>

When a HM is attached to a pool and a backend member in that pool
is a fake member (e.g. due to a typo on creation) the member remains
in ONLINE status. Basically this is due to the fact that there
isn't any LSP attached to that member and no Service_Monitor entries
will take care of it.

This patch checks inmediatelly after creation the member and update
the whole LB status to reflect this fake member that could help to
the user to identify quickly those fake members.

Add the 'docs' key and point it at a Discourse topic
previously populated with the charm's README contents.

When the new charm revision is released to the Charmhub,
this Discourse-based content will be displayed there. In
the absense of the this new key, the Charmhub's default
behaviour is to display the value of the charm's
'description' key.

Starting in openstacksdk 1.0.0, caching is moved to the proxy layer. As the cloud layer depends on the proxy layer in 1.0.0, this means both layers can benefit from the cache. Authenticating and accessing resources on a cloud is often expensive. It is therefore quite common that applications will wish to do some client-side caching of both credentials and cloud resources. To facilitate this, *openstacksdk* supports caching credentials and resources using the system keyring and *dogpile.cache*, respectively. .. tip:: It is important to emphasise that *openstacksdk* does not actually cache anything itself. Rather, it collects and presents the cache information so that your various applications that are connecting to OpenStack can share a cache should you desire. It is important that your cache backend is correctly configured according to the needs of your application. Caching in enabled or disabled globally, rather than on a cloud-by-cloud basis. This is done by setting configuring the``cache`` top-level key. Caching of authentication tokens can be configured using the following settings: ``cache.auth`` A boolean indicating whether tokens should be cached in the keyring. When enabled, this allows the consequent connections to the same cloud to skip fetching new token. When the token expires or is invalidated, `openstacksdk` will automatically establish a new connection. Defaults to ``false``. For example, to configure caching of authentication tokens. .. code-block:: yaml cache: auth: true Caching of resources can be configured using the following settings: ``cache.expiration_time`` The expiration time in seconds for a cache entry. This should be an integer. Defaults to ``0``. ``cache.class`` The cache backend to use, which can include any backend supported by *dogpile.cache* natively as well as backend provided by third-part packages. This should be a string. Defaults to ``dogpile.cache.memory``. ``cache.arguments`` A mapping of arbitrary arguments to pass into the cache backend. These are backend specific. Keys should correspond to a configuration option for the configured cache backend. Defaults to ``{}``. ``cache.expirations`` A mapping of resource types to expiration times. The keys should be specified in the same way as the metrics are emitted, by joining meaningful resource URL segments with ``.``. For example, both ``/servers`` and ``/servers/ID`` should be specified as ``servers``, while ``/servers/ID/metadata/KEY`` should be specified as `server.metadata`. Values should be an expiration time in seconds. A value of ``-1`` indicates that the cache should never expire, while a value of ``0`` disables caching for the resource. Defaults to ``{}`` For example, to configure caching with the ``dogpile.cache.memory`` backend with a 1 hour expiration. .. code-block:: yaml cache: expiration_time: 3600 To configure caching with the ``dogpile.cache.memory`` backend with a 1 hour expiration but only for requests to the OpenStack Compute service's ``/servers`` API: .. code-block:: yaml cache: expirations: servers: 3600 To configure caching with the ``dogpile.cache.pylibmc`` backend with a 1 hour expiration time and a memcached server running on your localhost. .. code-block:: yaml cache: expiration_time: 3600 arguments: url: - 127.0.0.1 To configure caching with the ``dogpile.cache.pylibmc`` backend with a 1 hour expiration time, a memcached server running on your localhost, and multiple per-resource cache expiration times. Finally, if the ``cache`` key is undefined, a null cache is enabled meaning caching is effectively disabled. .. note:: Non ``GET`` requests cause cache invalidation based on the caching key prefix. This means that, for example, a ``PUT`` request to ``/images/ID`` will invalidate all images cache (list and all individual entries). Moreover it is possible to explicitly pass the ``skip_cache`` parameter to the ``proxy._get`` function to bypass cache and invalidate what is already there. This is happening automatically in the ``wait_for_status`` methods where it is expected that resource will change some of the attributes over the time. Forcing complete cache invalidation can be achieved calling ``conn._cache.invalidate``combination of two different authorization plugins is used with their individual requirements to the specified parameters.","Accessing a cloud is often expensive, so it's quite common to want to do some client-side caching of those operations. To facilitate that, `openstacksdk` understands passing through cache settings to dogpile.cache, with the following behaviors: * Listing no config settings means you get a null cache. * `cache.expiration_time` and nothing else gets you memory cache. * Otherwise, `cache.class` and `cache.arguments` are passed in Different cloud behaviors are also differently expensive to deal with. If you want to get really crazy and tweak stuff, you can specify different expiration times on a per-resource basis by passing values, in seconds to an expiration mapping keyed on the singular name of the resource. A value of `-1` indicates that the resource should never expire. Not specifying a value (same as specifying `0`) indicates that no caching for this resource should be done. `openstacksdk` only caches `GET` request responses for the queries which have non-zero expiration time defined. Caching key contains url and request parameters, therefore no collisions are expected. The expiration time key is constructed (joined with `.`) in the same way as the metrics are emmited: * service type * meaningful resource url segments (i.e. `/servers` results in `servers`, `/servers/ID` results in `server`, `/servers/ID/metadata/KEY` results in `server.metadata` Non `GET` requests cause cache invalidation based on the caching key prefix so that i.e. `PUT` request to `/images/ID` will invalidate all images cache (list and all individual entries). Moreover it is possible to explicitly pass `_sdk_skip_cache` parameter to the `proxy._get` function to bypass cache and invalidate what is already there. This is happening automatically in the `wait_for_status` methods where it is expected that resource is going to change some of the attributes over the time. Forcing complete cache invalidation can be achieved calling `conn._cache.invalidate`. `openstacksdk` does not actually cache anything itself, but it collects and presents the cache information so that your various applications that are connecting to OpenStack can share a cache should you desire. clouds: mtvexx: profile: vexxhost auth: username: mordred@inaugust.com password: XXXXXXXXX project_name: mordred@inaugust.com region_name: ca-ymq-1 dns_api_version: 1 `openstacksdk` can also cache authorization state (token) in the keyring. That allow the consequent connections to the same cloud to skip fetching new token.

For deployment/evaluation we have another guide. Allways use the latest stable version from the distribution of your choice. Recommended reading ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ It's beneficial to learn basics of both `Ansible <https://docs.ansible.com>`__ and `Docker <https://docs.docker.com>`__ before running Kolla Ansible. Host machine requirements ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The host machine must satisfy the following minimum requirements: - 2 network interfaces - 8GB main memory - 40GB disk space - If you want to use cinder you need to configure a LVM or NFS. `Cinder-guide <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/reference/storage/cinder-guide.html>_. See the :kolla-ansible-doc:`support matrix <user/support-matrix>` for details of supported host Operating Systems. Kolla Ansible supports the default Python 3.x versions provided by the supported Operating Systems. For more information see `tested runtimes <|TESTED_RUNTIMES_GOVERNANCE_URL|>`_. Install dependencies ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Typically commands that use the system package manager in this section must be run with root privileges. It is generally recommended to use a virtual environment to install Kolla Ansible and its dependencies, to avoid conflicts with the system site packages. Note that this is independent from the use of a virtual environment for remote execution, which is described in :kolla-ansible-doc:`Virtual Environments <user/virtual-environments.html>`. #. For Debian or Ubuntu, update the package index. .. code-block:: console sudo apt update #. Install Python build dependencies: For CentOS, RHEL 8 or openEuler, run: .. code-block:: console sudo dnf install python3-devel libffi-devel gcc openssl-devel python3-libselinux For Debian or Ubuntu, run: .. code-block:: console sudo apt install python3-dev libffi-dev gcc libssl-dev Install dependencies using a virtual environment ------------------------------------------------ If not installing Kolla Ansible in a virtual environment, skip this section. #. Install the virtual environment dependencies. For CentOS, RHEL 8 or openEuler, you don't need to do anything. For Debian or Ubuntu, run: .. code-block:: console sudo apt install python3-venv #. Create a virtual environment and activate it: .. code-block:: console python3 -m venv /path/to/venv source /path/to/venv/bin/activate The virtual environment should be activated before running any commands that depend on packages installed in it. #. Ensure the latest version of pip is installed: .. code-block:: console pip install -U pip #. Install `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com>`__. Kolla Ansible requires at least Ansible ``4`` and supports up to ``5``. .. code-block:: console pip install 'ansible>=4,<6' #. Create a ansible.cfg file with default settings (all commented out) if not allready done before. .. code-block:: console ansible-config init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg This will create the ansible.cfg file in the current directory. If you want to use another path like /etc/ansible or something else, use the directly path. Install dependencies not using a virtual environment ---------------------------------------------------- If installing Kolla Ansible in a virtual environment, skip this section. #. Install ``pip``. For CentOS, RHEL or openEuler, run: .. code-block:: console sudo dnf install python3-pip For Debian or Ubuntu, run: .. code-block:: console sudo apt install python3-pip #. Ensure the latest version of pip is installed: .. code-block:: console sudo pip3 install -U pip #. Install `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com>`__. Kolla Ansible requires at least Ansible ``4`` and supports up to ``5``. For CentOS or RHEL, run: .. code-block:: console sudo dnf install ansible For openEuler, run: .. code-block:: console sudo pip install ansible For Debian or Ubuntu, run: .. code-block:: console sudo apt install ansible .. note:: If the installed Ansible version does not meet the requirements, one can use pip: ``sudo pip install -U 'ansible>=4,<6'``. Beware system package upgrades might interfere with that so it is recommended to uninstall the system package first. One might be better off with the virtual environment method to avoid this pitfall. Install Kolla-ansible ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #. Clone ``kolla-ansible`` repository from git. .. code-block:: console git clone --branch |KOLLA_BRANCH_NAME| https://opendev.org/openstack/kolla-ansible #. Install requirements of ``kolla`` and ``kolla-ansible``: If using a virtual environment: .. code-block:: console pip install ./kolla-ansible If not using a virtual environment: .. code-block:: console sudo pip3 install ./kolla-ansible #. Create the ``/etc/kolla`` directory. .. code-block:: console sudo mkdir -p /etc/kolla sudo chown $USER:$USER /etc/kolla #. Copy the configuration files to ``/etc/kolla`` directory. ``kolla-ansible`` holds the configuration files ( ``globals.yml`` and ``passwords.yml``) in ``etc/kolla``. .. code-block:: console cp -r kolla-ansible/etc/kolla/* /etc/kolla #. Copy the inventory files to the current directory. ``kolla-ansible`` holds inventory files ( ``all-in-one`` and ``multinode``) in the ``ansible/inventory`` directory. .. code-block:: console cp kolla-ansible/ansible/inventory/* . Install Ansible Galaxy requirements ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Install Ansible Galaxy dependencies (Yoga release onwards): .. code-block:: console kolla-ansible install-deps Configure Ansible ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ For best results, Ansible configuration should be tuned for your environment. For example, add the following options to the Ansible configuration file ``/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`` or ``/path/to/venv/ansible.cfg``: .. code-block:: ini [defaults] host_key_checking=False pipelining=True forks=100 Further information on tuning Ansible is available `here <https://www.ansible.com/blog/ansible-performance-tuning>`__. Prepare initial configuration ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Inventory --------- The next step is to prepare our inventory file. An inventory is an Ansible file where we specify hosts and the groups that they belong to. We can use this to define node roles and access credentials. Kolla Ansible comes with ``all-in-one`` and ``multinode`` example inventory files. The difference between them is that the former is ready for deploying single node OpenStack on localhost. In this Guide we will show the ``all-in-one`` Installation. For ``all-in-one`` scenario in virtual environment add the following to the very beginning of the inventory: .. code-block:: console localhost ansible_python_interpreter=python3 Kolla passwords --------------- Passwords used in our deployment are stored in ``/etc/kolla/passwords.yml`` file. All passwords are blank in this file and have to be filled either manually or by running random password generator: .. code-block:: console cd kolla-ansible/tools ./generate_passwords.py Kolla globals.yml ----------------- ``globals.yml`` is the main configuration file for Kolla Ansible and per default stored in /etc/kolla/globals.yml. There are a few options that are required to deploy Kolla Ansible: * Image options User has to specify images that are going to be used for our deployment. In this guide `Quay.io <https://quay.io/organization/openstack.kolla>`__-provided, pre-built images are going to be used. To learn more about building mechanism, please refer :kolla-doc:`Building Container Images <admin/image-building.html>`. Kolla provides choice of several Linux distributions in containers: - CentOS Stream (``centos``) - Ubuntu (``ubuntu``) - Debian (``debian``) - RHEL (``rhel``, deprecated) For newcomers, we recommend to use CentOS Stream 8 or Ubuntu 20.04. .. code-block:: console kolla_base_distro: ""centos"" * Networking Kolla Ansible requires a few networking options to be set. We need to set network interfaces used by OpenStack. First interface to set is ""network_interface"". This is the default interface for multiple management-type networks. .. code-block:: console network_interface: ""eth0"" Second interface required is dedicated for Neutron external (or public) networks, can be vlan or flat, depends on how the networks are created. This interface should be active without IP address. If not, instances won't be able to access to the external networks. .. code-block:: console neutron_external_interface: ""eth1"" To learn more about network configuration, refer :kolla-ansible-doc:`Network overview <admin/production-architecture-guide.html#network-configuration>`. Next we need to provide floating IP for management traffic. This IP will be managed by keepalived to provide high availability, and should be set to be *not used* address in management network that is connected to our ``network_interface``. If you use an existing OpenStack installation for your deployment, make sure the IP is allowed in the configuration of your VM. .. code-block:: console kolla_internal_vip_address: ""10.1.0.250"" * Enable additional services By default Kolla Ansible provides a bare compute kit, however it does provide support for a vast selection of additional services. To enable them, set ``enable_*`` to ""yes"". For example, to enable Block Storage service: .. code-block:: console enable_cinder: ""yes"" If you wanna use Cinder in your testdeployment you must configure a Cinder backend: .. code-block:: console enable_cinder_backend_lvm: ""yes"" For more information about this, please read the `Cinder-guide <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/reference/storage/cinder-guide.html>`_. Kolla now supports many OpenStack services, there is `a list of available services <https://github.com/openstack/kolla-ansible/blob/master/README.rst#openstack-services>`_. For more information about service configuration, Please refer to the :kolla-ansible-doc:`Services Reference Guide <reference/index.html>`. * Multiple globals files For a more granular control, enabling any option from the main ``globals.yml`` file can now be done using multiple yml files. Simply, create a directory called ``globals.d`` under ``/etc/kolla/`` and place all the relevant ``*.yml`` files in there. The ``kolla-ansible`` script will, automatically, add all of them as arguments to the ``ansible-playbook`` command. An example use case for this would be if an operator wants to enable cinder and all its options, at a later stage than the initial deployment, without tampering with the existing ``globals.yml`` file. That can be achieved, using a separate ``cinder.yml`` file, placed under the ``/etc/kolla/globals.d/`` directory and adding all the relevant options in there. * Virtual environment It is recommended to use a virtual environment to execute tasks on the remote hosts. This is covered :kolla-ansible-doc:`Virtual Environments <user/virtual-environments.html>`. Deployment ~~~~~~~~~~ After configuration is set, we can proceed to the deployment phase. First we need to setup basic host-level dependencies, like docker. Kolla Ansible provides a playbook that will install all required services in the correct versions. The following assumes the use of the ``all-in-one`` inventory. If using a different inventory, such as ``multinode``, replace the ``-i`` argument accordingly. #. Bootstrap servers with kolla deploy dependencies: .. code-block:: console cd kolla-ansible/tools ./kolla-ansible -i ../../all-in-one bootstrap-servers #. Do pre-deployment checks for hosts: .. code-block:: console kolla-ansible -i ../../all-in-one prechecks #. Finally proceed to actual OpenStack deployment: .. code-block:: console kolla-ansible -i ../../all-in-one deploy When this playbook finishes, OpenStack should be up, running and functional! If error occurs during execution, refer to :kolla-ansible-doc:`troubleshooting guide <user/troubleshooting.html>`. Using OpenStack ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #. Install the OpenStack CLI client: .. code-block:: console pip install python-openstackclient -c https://releases.openstack.org/constraints/upper/|KOLLA_OPENSTACK_RELEASE| #. OpenStack requires a ``clouds.yaml`` file where credentials for the admin user are set. To generate this file: .. code-block:: console cd kolla-ansible/tools ./kolla-ansible post-deploy * The file will be generated in /etc/kolla/clouds.yaml, you can use it by copying it to /etc/openstack or ~/.config/openstack or setting OS_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. #. Depending on how you installed Kolla Ansible, there is a script that will create example networks, images, and so on. .. warning:: You are free to use the following ``init-runonce`` script for demo purposes but note it does **not** have to be run in order to use your cloud. Depending on your customisations, it may not work, or it may conflict with the resources you want to create. You have been warned. .. code-block:: console kolla-ansible/tools/init-runonce ",,459,0

The maintenance worker from the neutron-api uses a southbound
connection. Since the southbound does not use any locking and all the
ovsdb locking is used for the northbound this changes should not have a
big impact.

This commit removes the leader_only flag for the maintenance worker.
This should also enable the neutron api to connect to relays instead of only
the sb directly.

While the patch where this was first introduced and set to 120 [1] is
sensible for the vast majority of jobs, it's conceivable that some
jobs might want a different value.

Specifically, the whitebox-tempest-plugin changes configurations and
restarts Nova services, and to do so it waits for the service status
to update in the API before continuing with the tests. With the report
interval set to 120 and the down time threshold set to 720, the
service would continue showing 'up' in the API long after it was
actually down, causing the wait to time out.

Whitebox is a low-traffic project with only a couple of devstack jobs
that run tempest tests sequentially (concurrency=1). Its CI is also
pretty stable. It seems legitimate for it to keep the old default
values of report_interval and service_down_time.

This patch keeps the 120 default for NOVA_SERVICE_REPORT_INTERVAL, but
makes it configurable by individual jobs. Since the original patch
also introduced CINDER_SERVICE_REPORT_INTERVAL as a constant, make
that configurable as well.

Up till now the ARA plugin has been pinned to a very old version,
and is no longer functional.

This installs a much newer version of ARA and adds a README file
to guide developers on how to view the sqlite file.

The ARA plugin is installed by default, but not activated. This
is intended to catch a small amount of regressions and
integration failures.

Developers can enable the plugin by adding the string `#ara`
to their commit message. This avoids extra load on the CI.

How do I view the output? ------------------------- You need a local installation of ARA: following the [getting started guide](https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html) should help you with installing the `ara-manage` command. For small scale operations, you have a choice between using: * [a small embedded server](https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#ara-manage-runserver), or * [rendering the html to static files](https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#ara-manage-generate) For example, rendering a particular log to static html pages: ``` # (Use the ""Download all logs"" script from the Artifacts tab with DOWNLOAD_DIR=~/zuul-logs) python3 -m pip install --user ""ara[server]=={{ ara_version.stdout | split(' ') | last }}"" export ARA_DATABASE_NAME=~/zuul-logs/{{ inventory_hostname }}/ara-report/ansible.sqlite ara-manage generate ~/zuul-logs/{{ inventory_hostname }}/ara-report/ara-html ``` Is there an easter egg? ----------------------- Yes, there is! If the commit message contains the string `#generate_ara_html` then Zuul will render the html file and collect it in the logs. Beware: this adds hundreds of MiB to the log files.

Recent changes to git prevent git repos from being parsed if they
are not owned by the current user as part of a CVE fix. Some
project use stevedore to load plugins and this is broken if
gnocchi is installed from git via ""sudo pip install"".

This change uses devstacks git_clone to ensure that the gnocchi
repos is clonned under $DEST aka /opt/stack as the current user not
root. It then uses pip install -e to install the precloned repo.

To enable this GNOCCHI_REPO and GNOCCHI_BRANCH are intoduced
and the non standard GNOCCHI_GIT_PATH is removed.

A long standing comment to stop installing from git after
Gnocchi 4.0 is adressed by only installing from  git if
gnocchi is listed in LIBS_FROM_GIT. However since
4.4.2 is currently incompatible with openstacks upper-constraits
file the ci will continue to git however the git repo will
now be prepared by zuul using required-projects.

This will have the side effect of allowing
Depends on to work for PRs to gnocchi however testing that
is out of scope of this patch.

This patch adds a sample local.conf that can be used to deploy
locally for devopment.

Currently StoredContext object tries to load auth plugin even when
a specific property(eg. user_domain_id) is already set. However this
is redundant and we can use the value loaded from stack instead.

Backport note:
This change omits the change about GLOBAL_VENV parameter in devstack
because the parameter was added after 2023.1 release.

Also, this contains change Ie0876080c771fb124d4dd36f803fbfd3b108e240
because Fedora 36 image is being removed from some mirrors.
