The tool for listing repositories is now in the openstack/releases repo,
so update list_library_unreleased_changes.sh to take a path to a copy of
that repo.

The release-notes command needs a name for the thing being queried, so
pass it the base repository name. That may not be correct in all cases,
but we don't care that it's correct because we're not publishing the

When generate_service_certificate is True,
undercloud_service_certificate will not necessarily be set when it
is passed to validation.  We need to check if either value is set
when deciding whether to validate vips.

Unit tests for this behavior were missing as well, so those have
been added.

Another consideration for this change is that we have started
passing non-IP values to these vip parameters when configuring
ssl.  This is counterintuitive, but apparently works as intended
so let's just rename the parameters and handle both IPs and DNS
names for those values.

This is released via the `project-config` machinery just like other TripleO projects. The tarball is produced by running `npm pack` in the root of the project, and excludes the `node_modules` directory. The tarballs are available [here][1]. ## Downstream ### RDO The product of RDO packaging is a set of two RPMs: * `openstack-tripleo-ui-deps` [GitHub][1] * `openstack-tripleo-ui` [GitHub][2] And of course, the second one depends on the first one. The `-deps` package contains the contents of the `node_modules` directory. An RPM is created from a `.spec` file. These files can be access via the above GitHub links. Any changes to the files are subject to review by the RDO team. This can be a lengthy process because software licenses need to be reviewed. RDO builds packages in two different streams: trunk and stable. Study the following graphic to understand how code flows through the pipeline: ## What to do when dependencies change This applies both to adding *new* dependencies, and upgrading *existing* ones. 1. Make the required changes in `package.json` 2. `$ rm -rf node_modules` 3. `$ npm cache clean` 4. `$ npm install` 5. `$ npm shrinkwrap` 6. Commit those changes along with your dependency changes in `tripleo-ui` 7. Update the `openstack-tripleo-ui-deps` ([GitHub][2]) package 8. Update the `openstack-tripleo-ui` ([GitHub][3]) package so that it points to the new version of `openstack-tripleo-ui-deps` [1]: http://tarballs.openstack.org/tripleo-ui/ [2]: https://github.com/rdo-common/openstack-tripleo-ui-deps [3]: https://github.com/rdo-packages/tripleo-ui-distgit/tree/rpm-master ",,51,0

See Glance and Swift calls for examples.Complex objects returned to the caller must be a `munch.Munch` type. The `shade._adapter.Adapter` class makes resources into `munch.Munch`. All objects should be normalized. It is shade's purpose in life to make OpenStack consistent for end users, and this means not trusting the clouds to return consistent objects. There should be a normalize function in `shade/_normalize.py` that is applied to objects before returning them to the user. See :doc:`model` for further details on object model requirements. Fields should not be in the normalization contract if we cannot commit to providing them to all users. Fields should be renamed in normalization to be consistent with the rest of shade. For instance, nothing in shade exposes the legacy OpenStack concept of ""tenant"" to a user, but instead uses ""project"" even if the cloud uses tenant.- New unit tests should only mock at the REST layer using `requests_mock`. Any mocking of shade itself or of legacy client libraries should be considered legacy and to be avoided. ","Client CallsAll underlying client calls (novaclient, swiftclient, etc.) must be wrapped by a Task object.Complex objects returned to the caller must be a dict type. The methods `obj_to_dict()` or `obj_list_to_dict()` should be used for this. As of this writing, those two methods are returning Munch objects, which help to maintain backward compatibility with a time when shade returned raw objects. Munch allows the returned resource to act as *both* an object and a dict.",23,9

The current pinning method for pip/setuptools/wheel works for the
initial setup of a host or python venv. However, when a python
package which has one of these in its requirements is installed
onto the host or into the venv and the '--upgrade' option is given
to pip, the package will be upgraded to the latest version available
within the given constraints.

As OpenStack's requirements management process does not cater for
the pip, setuptools or wheel packages we need to ensure that all
python install tasks prior to the repo being built use our global
pins as a constraint in addition to the OpenStack uppser constraints.

As pip's --constraints option can only take a file as an argument
we have to copy the global pins file to the target which will use
it. This file can be removed from the host once the repo is built.

Nodes old status clean-up has a top-level DB transaction that conflicts
with the node.fsm_event(timeout), eventually causing a deadlock.

Bumping the node.fsm_event(timeout) out from the top-level DB
transaction fixes the issue.

Also remove redundant attributes and options db records clean up and an
unneeded db flush on commit.

be an empty value. The order of the lines where DIB_CDH_VERSION is
assigned for other CDH versions where DIB_CDH_MINOR_VERSION is not
used was changed as well for consistency.

We currently blow up if we look at something like
snapshot['group_snapshot'] if there is no group snapshot.

Ideally this just returns None since there isn't a one.

In Newton, placement is optional and computes will stop even trying
to connect to placement when they encounter an error or missing
configuration. We really want them to keep trying so that enabling
the service pre-upgrade does not require restarting all computes
to start filling data.

This patch removes the auto-disable logic and replaces it with a
limited, but persistent warning to the logs about the required
nature of placement for the upgrade. If we had messaged the upcoming
requirement better, I think we could have been less chatty here.
However, we know that it's not been received, so this patch periodically
re-emits the warning and mentions the upgrade specifically.

This fixes a very subtle bug I discovered testing last week. On an

Ic155bd29d introduced new encryption provider constants while also
removing the previous ability of os-brick to match nova.volume.encryptor
class paths with local encryption provider implementations.

As a result we now need to explicitly list the nova.volume.encryptor
class paths in os-brick so that we continue to correctly load the
relevant encryption provider classes.

In Pike, changes will be made to Cinder to replace these class paths
in existing volumes with the new provider format constants.

This patch proposes to add a test to test volume migration
from one backend to another. Before running the tests,
please configure your local cinder deployment with a proper
multi-backend support.

[volume]
backend_names = lvmdriver-1,lvmdriver-2

[volume_feature_enabled]
multi_backend = True

A minimum of two backends are required. The test will migrate the volume
from the first to the second backend in the list. Other backends will
be ignored.

This test can be tested by 'check experimental' and must run and pass
the job'lvm-multibackend'.

Modify some codes in order to lead them meet the python3 common pattern.
Look through the following patterns of Cinder,
      map() and filter() if a list is needed on Python 3:
          Replace map(func, data) with [func(item) for item in data]
          Replace filter(lambda obj: test(obj), data) with
             [obj for obj in data if test(obj)]

         remove ""import exceptions""
      Replace iterator.next() with next(iterator)
      Replace basestring with six.string_types
      Replace unicode with six.text_type
      Replace (str, unicode) with six.string_types
      Replace ""for key in dict.iterkeys()"" with ""for key in dict""
      Replace dict.iteritems() with dict.items()
      Replace dict.itervalues() with dict.values()
I found that only ""filter(lambda obj: test(obj), data)"" and
""map(func, data)""need to modify.
The other items are not be founded in Cinder.

By doing so, users gain visiblity of the restore process: - Resources currently being protected - Resources restored successfully - Resources whose restore has failed, and the reason for the failure Problem description =================== Use Cases --------- - Giving visibility for the restore process - Exposing the user to the reason for the failure of a resource restore Proposed Change =============== - Add 'resource_status' and 'resource_reason' dictionaries to the Restore object - Add 'update_resource_status' method to the Restore object - Protection Plugin should use the 'update_resource_status' to set the status of each resource during restore operation Alternatives ------------ By not adding this, users will have no visibility to resource status during and after restore operation. Data model impact ----------------- - Add 'resource_status' dictionary to Restore object: represents the status of the restoring/restored resource - Add 'resource_reason' dictionary to Restore object: free text representing the reason for the restore failure of the resource REST API impact --------------- - 'resource_status' dictionary and 'resource_reason' dictionary are added to the Restore object Security impact --------------- Validation should be imposed on the status set by plugins, and on the reason text. Other end user impact --------------------- python-karborclient and karbor-dashboard should consume the new fields of the Restore object. Performance Impact ------------------ Calling 'update_resource_status' sets values in the database which should have a slight impact on performance. Other deployer impact --------------------- Protection plugins should use the new API to set the resource status. Implementation ============== Testing ======= Documentation Impact ==================== - Add 'resource_status' and 'resource_reason' to Restore object - Add 'update_restore_status' to Protection Plugin writing documentation ",,136,2

Currently the default behavior of LVM is
to scan all available block devices in
/dev folder, this leads to issues on environments
with Cinder LVM volumes. Guest's volumes are recognized
by parent host's OS and are scanned by LVM. If guest's
volume contains LVM inside, it is also detected by
parent host's OS. Such volumes can not be
deleted.

This patch modifies LVM filter on Cinder node in
order to exclude LVs present in Cinder volume group
from LVM scan. During testing it was found that
initramds should be updated upon changing of
filtering rules.

Functional tests for netns_cleanup have been failing a few times
in the gate lately. After thorough tests we've seen that the issue was
related to using rootwrap-daemon inside a wait_until_true loop. When
timeout fired while utils.execute() was reading from rootwrap-daemon,
it got interrupted and the output of the last command was not read.
Therefore, next calls to utils.execute() would read the output of
their previous command rather than their own, leading to unexpected
results.

This fix will poll existing processes in the namespace without making
use of the wait_until_true loop. Instead, it will check elapsed time
and raise the exception if timeout is exceeded.

Also, i'm removing debug traces introduced in
327f7fc4d54bbaaed3778b5eb3c51a037a9a178f which helped finding the root
cause of this bug.

Note:
This is an intentional mess for now in order to achieve
a working proof of concept.

The intention with this patch is to build all the software
(distro and python) into the lxc cache for re-use purposes,
both within the build and for repeating builds.

There are a lot of workarounds included here in order to
bypass issues discovered when creating the containers in
two stages and some other funky nonsense. These will be
cleaned up once the final process is working and acceptable.

The eventual intent will be to prepare caches for all
containers, but for now this is only focusing on the
OpenStack containers.

This patch adds a number of scenarios which an be
implemented for integrated gate tests.

The intent is to exercise multiple code paths
and to add telemetry testing for all scenarios to
ensure that telemetry tests are done here instead
of in role tests.

SwiftService uploads large objects using a thread pool. (The pool
defaults to 5 and we're not currently configuring it larger or smaller)
Instead of using that, spin up upload threads on our own so that we can
get rid of the swiftclient depend.

A few notes:
- We're using the new async feature of the Adapter wrapper, which rate
  limits at the _start_ of a REST call. This is sane as far as we can
  tell, but also might not be what someone is expecting.
- We'll skip the thread pool uploader for objects that are smaller than
  the default max segment size.
- In splitting the file into segments, we'd like to avoid reading all of
  the segments into RAM when we don't need to - so there is a file-like
  wrapper class which can be passed to requests. This implements a
  read-view of a portion of the file. In a pathological case, this could
  be slower due to disk seeking on the read side. However, let's go back
  and deal with buffering when we have a problem - I imagine that the
  REST upload will be the bottleneck long before the overhead of
  interleaved disk seeks will be.

The assumption that we don't need to write an entry in the invalidations
file when the hashes.pkl does not exist turned out to be a premature
optimization and also wrong.

Primarily we should recognize the creation of hashes.pkl is the first
thing that happens in a part when it lands on a new primary.  The code
should be optimized toward the assumption of the most common disk state.

Also, in this case the extra stat calls to check if the hashes.pkl exists
were not only un-optimized - but introducing a race.

Consider the common case:

proc 1                         | proc 2
-------------------------------|---------------------------
a) read then truncate journal  |
b) do work                     | c) append to journal
d) apply ""a"" to index          |

The index written at ""d"" may not (yet) reflect the entry writen by proc
2 at ""c""; however, it's clearly in the journal so it's easy to see we're
safe.

Adding in the extra stat call for the index existence check increases
the state which can effect correctness.

proc 1                        | proc 2
------------------------------|---------------------------
a) no index, truncate journal |
b) do work                    | b) iff index exists
                              | c) append to journal
d) apply (or create) index    |

If step ""c"" doesn't happen because the index does not yet exist - the
update is clearly lost.

In our case we'd skip marking a suffix as invalid when the hashes.pkl
does not exist because we know ""the next time we rehash"" we'll have to
os.listdir suffixes anyway.  But if another process is *currently*
rehashing (and has already done it's os.listdir) instead we've just
dropped an invalidation on the floor.

Don't do that.

Instead - write down the invalidation.  The running rehash is welcome to
proceed on outdated information - as long as the next pass will grab and
hash the new suffix.

Known-Issue(s):

If the suffix already exists there's an even chance the running rehash
will hash in the very update for which we want to invalidate the suffix,
but that's ok it's idempotent.

Over the Ocata cycle, we've been incubating the community of developers around the Charms, with new charms for Murano, Trove, Mistral and CloudKitty all due to be included in the release in February. We've also started to engage successfully with the vendor ecosystem around OpenStack, with PLUMgrid, Calico and 6wind all working towards aligment and inclusion in the OpenStack Charm release. This is all helping to diversify the development community around the Charms. I'll continue to work to support the wider ecosystem adoption of the Charms as a great way to deploy and manage OpenStack. We've made some in-roads into improving the developer experience for charm authors, but I feel there is still progress to be made so I will continue to focus on this aspect of the project during the Pike cycle. I look forward to working with the team and steering the project for another cycle! Cheers James ",,27,0

Translation sync often fails for networking-midonet since
/tmp/openstack/neutron already exists.

This happens since we run the translation sync on a machine that is used
for a variety of jobs, a previous run of this job will leave the content
there and then fail.

Install inside the source directory, so that git clean will work.

Note this is a partial sync with the same file in networking-odl.

The hardcoded values that are being placed into the keystone_authtoken
section of murano.conf are failing when devstack is being deployed with
ENABLE_IDENTITY_V2 set to False or with tls-proxy enabled.

So instead use the handy configure_auth_token_middleware() function from
lib/keystone to configure this section. Also replace some occurrences of
hardcoded self-built keystone URLs by $KEYSTONE_AUTH_URI.

We need to introduce a new MURANO_CACHE_DIR variable for this until the
deprecated signing_dir option is finally removed.

TODO:

- Check whether using this function from upstream devstack is safe.
- Check for possible issues when deploying legacy keystone v2.

This middleware makes it possible to send messages to OpenStack Zaqar whenever
an object is updated. Uses a GreenPool to allow sending messages in the
background without blocking user requests, and low default timeouts in case the
backend is no longer available.

It's not strictly required to use OpenStack Zaqar; it is possible to use custom
message backends as long as the backend is able to receive and process POST
requests with a JSON body.

Sending notifications is done inside an eventlet.Greenpool(); the middleware
skips sending notifications if there are no free threads in the pool to avoid
blocking. In that case an error message is logged instead.

"""""" ``notifications`` is a middleware which sends a notification to OpenStack Zaqar or other messaging services when an object is modified (PUT, POST, COPY, DELETE). To enable this a special meatadata settings must be set on the container. In an OpenStack environment is is most likely that the OpenStack messaging service Zaqar will be used to receive and process messages. However, this middleware can be used with other messaging service that accepts the REST API calls defined below. ``notifications`` uses the ``x-container-meta-notifications-url`` metadata entry to define the endpoint to send notifications to. An example URL looks like this:: https://devstack:8888/v1/queues/samplequeue/messages Note that the queue must be created in advance in OpenStack Zaqar. This middleware creates no queue by default, and silently ignores any errors while sending notifications to the defined backend URL. A queue called can be created like this (note that you have to use your account name as project ID):: curl -i -X PUT http://localhost:8888/v1/queues/samplequeue \ -H ""Content-type: application/json"" \ -H ""X-Project-Id: AUTH_test"" After a message queue has been created you can set the container meta to the notifications URL using the swift CLI:: swift post containername -m 'notifications-url: http://localhost:8888/v1/queues/samplequeue/messages' Please note the trailing ""/messages"" part in the URL. This is the endpoint in Zaqar to send messages to. The middleware sends a POST request with the following JSON body on each object modification to this URL:: [{""ttl"": 86400,""body"": { ""method"": ""<method>"", ""account"": ""<account>"", ""container"": ""<container>"", ""object"": ""<object>""}}] The following headers are also set:: Content-type: application/json X-Auth-Token: <Auth token if set> Accept: application/json X-Project-Id: <account> The ``notifications`` middleware should be added to the pipeline in your ``/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf`` file just after any auth middleware. You also need to define the allowed_hosts; notifications are only sent to URLs that match these hostnames. This is important; otherwise it is possible to use an arbitrary URL where tokens are sent to. For example:: [pipeline:main] pipeline = catch_errors cache tempauth notifications proxy-server [filter:notifications] use = egg:swift#notifications allowed_hosts = localhost send_auth_token = True conn_timeout = 0.5 response_timeout = 0.5 """""" import json from urlparse import urlparse import uuid from eventlet import Timeout from eventlet.greenpool import GreenPool from swift.common import bufferedhttp from swift.common.utils import config_true_value, get_logger, \ register_swift_info from swift.common.swob import wsgify from swift.proxy.controllers.base import get_container_info class NotificationMiddleware(object): """"""Notification middleware See above for a full description.

This middleware allows to set a metadata entry ""alias"" to a container.
Requests to a container with an alias-metadata entry will be redirected
to the account/container value from the metadata entry. Think of it like
symlinks for Swift containers.

This makes it much easier to access containers and objects from other
accounts because clients don't need to use the storage URL from the other
account (except for setting the metadata entry).

fetch_value function

The functions for extracting values from a nested structure
have a long and funny history. Currently this function is
named ""dig"" and is used in the Fule linrary by this name.
But in Puppet 4.5 another incompatible ""dig"" function was
introduced and the original ""dig"" in the stdlib was renamed
to dig44.

The dig function from the stdlib doesn't support :undef values
and has problems with other values too. This function is
based on the ""dig44"" but has some improvements needed for
Puppet4.5+.

1. What is the problem

Currently all networking scenarios were put in one page
http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tricircle/networking-guide.html.
This is inconvinent for readers to navigate the content of different
scenarios.

At the same time, the configuration of service_plugins is missing
in local Neutron installation configuration items.

2. What is the solution to the problem
Add one more level, to make each networking scenario being rendered
in different page. This adjustment will also lead to the title level
adjustment of installation-manual.

Add the service_plugins configuration item in
installation_manual.rst.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle
No new features

See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License. ================== Health Policy V1.0 ================== The health policy is designed to automate the failure detection and recovery process for a cluster. Applicable Profile Types ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The policy is designed to handle both ``os.nova.server`` and ``os.heat.stack`` profile types. Actions Handled ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The policy is capable of handling the following actions: - ``CLUSTER_RECOVER``: an action that carries some parameters as its inputs. - ``CLUSTER_DEL_NODES``: an action that carries a list value named ``candidates`` in its ``inputs`` value. - ``CLUSTER_SCALE_IN``: an action that carries an optional integer value named ``count`` in its ``inputs`` value. - ``CLUSTER_RESIZE``: an action that carries various key-value pairs as arguments to the action in its ``inputs`` value. - ``NODE_DELETE``: an action that has a node associated with it. This action has to be originated from a RPC request directly so that it will be processed by the health policy. The policy will be checked **BEFORE** a ``CLUSTER_RECOVER`` action is executed. It will derive the appropriate inputs to the action based on the policy's properties. The policy will be checked **BEFORE** and **AFTER** any one of the ``CLUSTER_DEL_NODES``, ``CLUSTER_SCALE_IN``, ``CLUSTER_RESIZE`` and the ``NODE_DELETE`` action is executed. Under the condition that any of these actions are originated from RPC requests, Senlin is aware of the fact that a cluster is losing node member(s) because of a normal cluster membership management operation initiated by users rather than unexpected node failures. The health policy will temporarily disable the *health manager* function on the cluster in question and re-enable the health management after the action has completed. The health policy can be treated as an interface for the *health manager* engine running inside the ``senlin-engine`` process. Its specification contains two main ""sections"", ``detection`` and ``recovery``, each of which specifies how to detect node failures and how to recover a node to a healthy status respectively. Failure Detection ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The health policy is designed to be flexible regarding node failure detection. The current vision is that the health policy will support following types of failure detection: * ``NODE_STATUS_POLLING``: the *health manager* periodically polls a cluster and check if there are nodes. * ``VM_LIFECYCLE_EVENTS``: the *health manager* listens to event notifications sent by the backend service (e.g. nova-compute). * ``LB_STATUS_POLLING``: the *health manager* periodically polls the load balancer (if any) and see if any node has gone offline. The third option above (``LB_STATUS_POLLING``) is not usable yet due to an outstanding issue in the LBaaS service. But we are still tracking its progress considering that metrics from the load-balancer is more trust-worthy and more useful because they originate from the data plane rather than the control plane. Yet another option regarding load-balancer based health detection is to have the load-balancer emit event notifications when node status changes. This is also an ongoing work which may take some time to land. Proactive Node Status Polling ----------------------------- The most straight-foward way of node failure detection is by checking the backend service about the status of the physical resource represented by a node. If the ``type`` of ``detection`` is set to ""``NODE_STATUS_POLLING``"" (optionally, with an ``interval`` value specified), the *health manager* will periodically check the resource status by querying the backend service and see if the resource is active. Below is a sample configuration:: type: senlin.policy.health version: 1.0 properties: detection: type: NODE_STATUS_POLLING options: internal: 120 ... **NOTE**: The current polling logic is only about checking with the backend service whether a resource is in ""ACTIVE"" status. However, in future, this may get extended to having the *health manager* ping the IP address of a nova server or posting a ""GET"" request to a specific URL. We believe such extensions can better reveal whether a specific node is operating. Once such a policy object is attached to a cluster, Senlin registers the cluster to the *health manager* engine for failure detection, i.e., node health checking. A thread is created to issue a ``CLUSTER_CHECK`` RPC request to the ``senlin-engine`` periodically at the specified interval. The ``CLUSTER_CHECK`` action only refreshes the status of each and every node in the cluster. When one of the ``senlin-engine`` services is restarted, a new *health manager* engine will be launched. This new engine will check the database and see if there are clusters which have health policies attached and thus having its health status maintained by a *health manager* that is no longer alive. The new *health manager* will pick up these clusters for health management. Listening to Event Notifications -------------------------------- For some profile types (currently ``os.nova.server``), the backend service may emit an event notification on the control plane message bus. These events are more economic ways for node failure detection, assuming that all kinds of status changes will be captured and reported by the backend service. Actually, we have verified that most lifecycle events related to a VM server are already captured and reported by Nova. For other profile types such as ``os.heat.stack``, there also exists such a possibility although based on our knowledge Heat cannot detect all stack failures. Event listening is a cheaper way for node failure detection when compared to the status polling approach described above. To instruct the *health manager* to listen to event notifications, users can attach their cluster(s) a health policy which looks like the following example:: type: senlin.policy.health version: 1.0 properties: detection: type: VM_LIFECYCLE_EVENTS ... **NOTE**: The type name ``VM_LIFECYCLE_EVENTS`` are too specific to Nova server nodes, this may be changed in future. When such a policy is attached to a cluster, Senlin registers the cluster to the *health manager* engine for failure detection, i.e., node health checking. A listener thread is created to events that indicate certain node has failed. For nova server nodes, the current implementation treats all of the following event types as indication of node failures: * ``compute.instance.delete.end``: A server has been accidentally deleted. * ``compute.instance.pause.end``: A server has been accidentally paused. * ``compute.instance.power_off.end``: A server has been stopped accidentally. * ``compute.instance.rebuild.error``: A server rebuild has failed. * ``compute.instance.shutdown.end``: A server has been shut down for unknown reasons. * ``compute.instance.soft_delete.end``: A server has been soft deleted. When any one of such an event is heard by the listener thread, it will issue a ``NODE_RECOVER`` RPC request to the senlin-engine service. For the health policy to make a smarter decision on the proper recover operation, the RPC request is augmented with some parameters as hints to the recovery operation as exemplified below:: { ""event"": ""SHUTDOWN"", ""state"": ""shutdown"", ""instance_id"": ""449ad837-3db2-4aa9-b324-ecd28e14ab14"", ""timestamp"": ""2016-11-27T12:10:58Z"", ""publisher"": ""nova-compute:node1"", } Ideally, a health management solution can react differently based on the different types of failures detected. For example, a server stopped by accident can be simply recovered by start it again; a paused server can be unpaused quickly instead of being recreated. When one of the ``senlin-engine`` services is restarted, a new *health manager* engine will be launched. This new engine will check the database and see if there are clusters which have health policies attached and thus having its health status maintained by a *health manager* that is no longer alive. The new *health manager* will pick up these clusters for health management. Recovery Actions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The value of the recovery ``actions`` key for ``recovery`` is modeled as a list, each of which specifies an action to try. The list of actions are to be adjusted by the policy before passing on to a base ``Profile`` for actual execution. An example (imaginary) list of actions is shown below:: type: senlin.policy.health version: 1.0 properties: ... recovery: actions: - name: REBOOT params: type: soft - name: REBUILD - name: my_evacuation_workflow type: MISTRAL_WORKFLOW params: node_id: {{ node.physicalid }} The above specification basically tells Senlin engine to try a list of recovery actions one by one. The first thing to try is to ""reboot"" (an operation only applicable on a Nova server) the failed node in question. If that didn't solve the problem, the engine is expected to ""rebuild"" (also a Nova server specific verb) the failed node. If this cannot bring the node back to healthy status, the engine should execute a Mistral workflow named ""``my_evacuation_workflow``"" and pass in the physical ID of the node. The health policy is triggered when a ``CLUSTER_RECOVER`` action is to be executed. Using the above example, the policy object will fill in the ``data`` field of the action object with the following content:: { ""health"": { ""recover_action"": [ { ""name"": ""REBOOT"", ""params"": { ""type"": ""soft"" } }, { ""name"": ""REBUILD"" }, { ""name"": ""my_evacuation_workflow"", ""type"": ""MISTRAL_WORKFLOW"", ""params"": { ""node_id"": ""7a753f4b-417d-4c10-8065-681f60db0c9a"" } } ] ... } } This action customization is eventually passed on to the ``Profile`` base class where the actual actions are performed. **NOTE**: Currently, we only support a single action in the list. The support to Mistral workflow is also an ongoing work. Default Recovery Action ----------------------- Since Senlin is designed to manage different types of resources, each resource type, i.e. :term:`profile type`, may support different sets of operations that can be used for failure recovery. A more practical and more general operation to recover a failed resource is to delete the old one followed by creating a new one, thus a ``RECREATE`` operation. Note that the ``RECREATE`` action is although generic enough, it may and may not be what users want. For example, there is not guarantee that a recreated Nova server will preserve its physical ID or its IP address. The temporary status of the original server will be lost for sure. Profile-specific Recovery Actions --------------------------------- Each profile type supports a unique set of operations, some of which are relevant to failure recovery. For example, a Nova server may support many operations that can be used for failure recovery, a Heat stack may support only the ``STACK_UPDATE`` operation for recovery. This set of actions that can be specified for recovery is profile specific, thus an important part for the policy to check and validate. External Recovery Actions ------------------------- In real-life deployments, there are use cases where a simple recovery of a node itself is not sufficient to bring back the business services or applications that were running on those nodes. There are other use cases where appropriate actions must be taken on the storage and/or network used for a full failure recovery. These are the triggers for the Senlin team to bring in support to Mistral workflows as special actions. The current design is to allow for a mixture of built-in recovery actions and user provided workflows. In the forseeable future, Senlin does not manage the workflows to be executed and the team has no plan to support the debugging of workflow executions. Users have to make sure their workflows are doing things they want. Fencing Support ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The term ""fencing"" is used to describe the operations that make sure a seemingly failed resource is dead for sure. This is a very important aspect in all high-availability solutions. Take a Nova server failure as an example, there are many causes which can lead the server into an inactive status. A physical host crash, a network connection breakage etc. can all result in a node unreachable. From Nova controllers perspective, it may appear that the host has gone offline, however, what really happened could be just the management network is experiencing some problems. The host is actually still there, all the VM instances on it are still active, which means they are still processing requests and they are still using the IP addresses allocated to them by a DHCP server. There are many such cases where a seemingly inactive node is still working and these nodes will bring the whole cluster into unpredictable status if we only attempt an immature recovery action without considering the possibility that the nodes are still alive. Considering this, we are working on modeling and implementing support to fencing in the health policy. ",,337,3

DevStack doesn't use extras.d to install external repository plugins
anymore. It has been replaced by the plugins interface [1][2]. However,
extras.d related code was still contained in the contrib/devstack
directory.

If you have nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html To test out your formatting, see http://www.tele3.cz/jbar/rest/rest.html ===================== Swift storage backend ===================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/zaqar/+spec/swift-storage Swift is a widely deployed object storage solution for OpenStack. While it's not particularly designed for high throughput of lots of small objects, which is what Zaqar mostly does, it scales really well, and is highly fault tolerant. It would also provide an alternative to people that want to avoid to deploy and manage MongoDB. Driver description ================== The driver only implements the data part, SQL being available for the control driver. Containers are used per entity and per project, to provide multitenancy. Proposed change =============== The driver uses one global service user, and stores all messages in one project. It uses suffix on container names to scope them. It will use mostly one container per entity type, plus other for additional indexes. We may need to increase or decrease the number of containers used, to find the appropriate performance balance. It may be worth marking the driver experimental first, so that we can change the storage model without caring about migrating data. What are the driver's guarantees in terms of reliability? ========================================================= We rely on Swift being configured appropriately to provide message reliability. By default objects are replicated 3 times, which offers good guarantees. What are the driver's guarantees in terms of scalability? ========================================================= Again, we rely on Swift scalability guarantees here. What are the driver's guarantees in terms of interoperability? ============================================================== We use publicly available Swift APIs, so the data is easily auditable and recoverable behind Zaqar. What are the driver's guarantees in terms of openness? ====================================================== We use python-swiftclient to access Swift, which uses the Apache 2.0 license. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: therve Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: Ocata-3 Work Items ---------- * Implement storage driver, and make unit tests pass. * Add a voting gate against Swift. * Possibly make some performance testing to tweak how objects are stored.

changed since it will actually change the db value
regardless resulting in a revocation event and all current
tokens being invalidated.

When a retype requires migrating a volume the check on the volume
manager will always consider that there's no need to migrate so it will
not try to migrate the volume but retype it instead, so in drivers that
implement `retype` (like LVM) it will falsely report success.

This patch fixes the check to detect if the volume is in our own
backend.

Aside from the ansible bug workaround not working, an issue was
introduced by I5a018c88dde73564d15e15535d080adc5415e663 which
causes the fastest mirror fact set output to render incorrectly.

It should use stdout_lines instead of stdout, because running
the ""list"" filter on stdout (a string) causes the string to be
split into a char-by-char list of the string, rather than a
single element list containing the whole string.

This removes the call to the list filter and uses the list
in stdout_lines that already exists.

Unfortunately this does not work around the ansible bug but it
is cleaner than reverting to the original fact set so I would
prefer to fix the updated implementation instead of reverting
I5a018c88dde73564d15e15535d080adc5415e663.

Since commit a388f78c8cb4b1c860bfc11029b5210955f1932d, we fetch
routers existing floating ip address from the fip namespace's
route table instead of qrouter namespace's qg device for the

still fetch the existing floating ip like legacy router, causing

After removing the get_router_cidrs method, the dvr_edge_ha router
inherit the get_router_cidrs method from dvr_local router and it
will remove the existent floating ip rules successfully if we
disassociate the floating ip.

Previously, we only accepted iterables of strings like 'Header: Value'.

This should be more intuitive for application developers, who are
already used to being able to pass dicts or lists of tuples to libraries

Adding constraints support to libraries is slightly more complex than
services as the libraries themselves are listed in upper-constraints.txt
which leads to errors that you can't install a specific version and a
constrained version.

This change adds constraints support by also adding a helper script to
edit the constraints to remove python-swiftclient.

There were several implementations of hashing the content
of a file in cli/recon.py and common/middleware/recon.py.
This patch relocates one implementation (_hash_for_ringfile,
introduced in the Related Change) to common/utils.py and
refactors recon cli and middleware to use that function.

Also improves use of mocking in the unit tests to eliminate passing
custom file opener functions to the ReconMiddleware get_ring_md5
and get_swift_conf_md5 methods.

Instead of registering new groups we can reuse already registered
groups in tempest/config.py.

Changes should be made to the following groups:

a) service_available_group - We don't need this group in plugin code
because it is already being registered in tempest code and service
availability is being checked for in the /tempest/api/volume/base.py
and the test cases in plugin code inherits this base.py

b) cinder group - Instead of registering a new cinder group for plugin
tests we can add plugin specific configuration options in the existing
volume group as the same conf object from tempest is being passed on
to the plugin

Adding two classes RequestIdProxy and GeneratorProxy derived from
wrapt.ObjectProxy to wrap objects returned from the API.

GeneratorProxy class is used to wrap generator objects returned
by cases like images.list() etc. whereas RequestIdProxy class is
used to wrap non-generator object cases like images.create() etc.

In all cases the returned object will have the same behavior as
the wrapped(original) object. However now the returned objects
will have an extra property 'request_ids' which is a list of
exactly one request id.

For generator cases the request_ids property will be an empty list
until the underlying generator is invoked at-least once.

Adds ceph-ansible integration to OSA using the upstream
roles ceph-common, ceph-mon, and ceph-osd to support deployment
of a Ceph cluster for use with OSA.

The integration should be considered experimental at this point,
however an integrated functional testing scenario named ""ceph""
is added which fully exercises the ceph-ansible deployment and
configures OSA to use the deployed Ceph cluster. Once this is added

Image Volume Cache mechanism was not cluster aware and therefore cached
images would not be shared among different services in the same cluster.

This patch addresses this issue and makes sure that they share by
cluster if there is one.

This patch does not address any concurrency issues that may currently
exist in the caching mechanism's code.

ipxe may freeze during the boot process for various reason, e.g: TFTP/HTTP
error during the initrd download. In this case ipxe will wait, this unless
a timeout is passed with the --timeout parameter.

Since force_power_state_during_sync is False, ironic won't turn off the
node and will wait instead. At the end, the node will be dropped out of
the poll of available nodes. This, just because ipxe is frozen and the
machine stay running.

Enabling this parameter can be enough to avoid this situation.

NOTE: This Mitaka backport is slighly different because
ironic::drivers::pxe::ipxe_timeout was not exposed in Hiera.

We need to squash to patches if we want to unblock stable/mitaka CI.

First patch:

Fix bashate errors and warnings (lint)

Fix 1 warning and 1 error in bash syntax:

1) E043: Arithmetic compound has inconsistent return semantics.
   Fix the bash syntax to be compliant.

2) ERROR: Split export and assignments in 2 files. Ignore the files.
   Fix the bash syntax to be compliant.
   Note: this test has been introducted by

(cherry picked from commit 9031dcf62016c5ca198a39109425b9f063e131fc)

Second Patch:

Run `yum update -y` before Puppet run

This patch run `yum update -y` right before running os-refresh-config
(Puppet).

1) Running `yum` from an Exec in Puppet is a bad idea because Puppet has
no idea which packages resources are touched, so we're loosing the
orchestration control.

2) We need to ensure that `yum update -y` runs before any attempt to
deploy OpenStack services, so we have latest packages from RDO and
CentOS.

The NFS implementation based off cinder_nfs_client
does not support per cinder backend configuration,
separating NFS mounts per backend.
This fix removes cinder_nfs_client in favor of
fully supporting multi cinder backends over the
cinder_backends stanza.

Run the tests in permissive mode but run sealert at the end to see if we
have some SElinux alerts that we need to fix.

We want to run catch_selinux_alerts function before exiting the script
(with failure or success) so we can detect alerts:
* right after first Puppet run
* after second Puppet run
* after Tempest run

If an AVC is detected, fails so we can report the bugs in
openstack-selinux and bring useful feedback.

Problem, if a user has old source in OPT_WORKDIR they

I consider this a temporary fix until we either add traps

can happen in other cases.
Neither of the ideal fixes are small changes and a warning should be
raised to the user to run with --clean in the meantime.

Cells v2 requires that compute hosts are registered with a cell.

In a single-node devstack run the 'nova-manage cell_v2 simple_cell_setup'
command will create a cell from the main (only) cell database, discover
the compute node and map it to the cell.

In a multinode setup, we need to run discover_hosts on the primary node
after the subnode is setup since the subnode doesn't know which cell
it's going to be in and doesn't (or can't rely on) have the database
connection to auto-register.

The discover_hosts command is idempotent so running this from a
single-node or multi-node setup will make no difference.
