When we consolidated resource locking with resource state transitions in
a7376f7494b310e9367ebe5dcb43b432a4053023, prepare_update_replace() moved
outside of the locked section, so that other update operations could

lock is still held (if we have transitioned the resource to
UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS, and thus acquired the lock), or that we acquire the
lock before calling it (if UpdateReplace is raised before attempting to

To avoid unnecessary locking and unlocking, we only take the lock if the
Resource plugin has overridden the default handler method (either
restore_prev_rsrc() or prepare_for_replace()), since the defaults do
nothing.

This differs from the patch on master because

so there are different paths for the cases where there are or are not

When a user updates from a deprecated resource type to an
equivalent-but-differently-named one (e.g. from
OS::Heat::SoftwareDeployments to OS::Heat::SoftwareDeploymentGroup), Heat
is supposed to change the type without replacing the resource as it would
normally do when a resource type changes. This was broken in convergence,
because since 45073226752c58d640ea5a59b7e532c022a4939b the new Resource
object we create during the check_resource operation (using the new type's
plugin) is no longer automatically initialised with data from the database
as resources in the legacy path are.

Move the substitution checking to the Resource.load() method, so that it
now returns an instance of the new plugin where allowed. In the actual
update_convergence() method then we need only check that the resource class
is the one we'd expect from the new template, and replace the resource if
not.

We do have a test that is designed to check that this is working, but in it
we didn't compare the physical IDs of the resource that is potentially
getting replaced, but rather the physical IDs of some other resource that
can't possibly get modified (surprise! it doesn't change).

The current functional test does a full upgrade process,
but uses the same current role for both the previous
version and the new version.

Ideally we want to test the initial deploy using the
previous series' role, so that we're actually testing
a series upgrade, not just a rabbitmq upgrade.

This patch separates the upgrade test out and makes the
default test just be a deployment. This allows us to
more clearly see where something breaks.

This is a backport of:
- https://review.openstack.org/527592
- https://review.openstack.org/545801

The machinectl cache is currently set image to 16G by default. If
multiple container images are imported into the cache this may be too
small by default. This change sets the cache to ""64G"" by default allowing
the cache more room to grow by.

This change also disables the quota system once the limit has been set
The option `lxc_host_machine_quota_disabled` has been added to disable or
enable the quota system as needed. This is done after the default limit has
been set so an adequately sized sparce file can be created should it not
already exist.

> More documentation can be seen here [0] with regard to the set-limit
  option.

Because we support both modern and older systemd, the cache prep tasks
for old systemd have been updated so that deployers using earlier
versions of systemd can benefit from the ability to grow an existing
cache via playbook run.

There are several issues with the implementation of generic volume
groups in the VMAX driver. There is no rollback implemented in case
of errors for create group from source or for deleting groups. There
can be issues if source groups have been modified since a snapshot
was taken. The provider_location is also not being updated in the
individual volume snapshot objects of a group snapshot. This patch
rectifies these issues, and also does some general refactoring of
the generic volume group code.

Currently the pip_install role does not configure any

This patch ensures that the same constraints are used

Currently the ARA database is not collected after each
test, nor is the reporting done as it should be. This
patch does the following to resolve that:

1. Informs the log collection to collect to and from
   the right source folder.

2. Verifies that the logs directory exists to ensure
   that a missing directory does not cause the job to
   fail.

3. Makes the log collection quiet, so that only errors
   are reported when pulling them back to the zuul
   executor.

4. Removes a layer of indirection by making zuul use
   the scripts library directly instead of working
   through yet another wrapper script.

5. Sets the exit code properly so that the ARA report
   is run on test execution failure.

The token provider listened for specific callbacks from the
federation and oauth APIs. These were mainly for token invalidation
and token persistence removal. Now that the sql token driver and uuid
token provider have been removed, we can remove the need for
persistence notifications.

Instead, both of these cases can use a generic token cache
invalidation callback. This makes the token provider Manager simpler
because it only has to listen for a single internal notification to
invalidate the token cache, instead of multiple. It also makes the
code sending the notification easier to understand because it's
clearer about what it's doing.

In SSHPool when we free the SSHpool add a destructor
that closes all the connections in the SSHPool.

In the SSHPool when we resize to make the max_size smaller
that current_size or otherwise end up with a
current_size being greater than the max_size, we now close
the connection by adding a put method that closes the
connection before discarding the connection.

This is a backport of:
- https://review.openstack.org/527592
- https://review.openstack.org/545801

The machinectl cache is currently set image to 16G by default. If
multiple container images are imported into the cache this may be too
small by default. This change sets the cache to ""64G"" by default allowing
the cache more room to grow by.

This change also disables the quota system once the limit has been set
The option `lxc_host_machine_quota_disabled` has been added to disable or
enable the quota system as needed. This is done after the default limit has
been set so an adequately sized sparce file can be created should it not
already exist.

> More documentation can be seen here [0] with regard to the set-limit
  option.

Because we support both modern and older systemd, the cache prep tasks
for old systemd have been updated so that deployers using earlier
versions of systemd can benefit from the ability to grow an existing
cache via playbook run.

At the moment, all drivers are being installed for Gnocchi even
if some of them are not used.  This also means that some libraries
are being built which are not needed (such as for Ceph or Swift
when using file storage).

This patch switches the behaviour to install only the extra for

Currently a new node joining the cluster is done by using
a try/rescue operation which always fails for a new node,
causing a lot of confusion due to the failed task report.

This patch ensures that the implementation no longer does
that.

In order to prevent lint check failures, each join task
has a 'changed_when: true' added.

This patch changes the use of systemctl via the command module
over to the Ansible systemd module.

One conditional check for systemd was removed since all supported
distributions deployed by OSA have systemd.

These additions will allow us to filter nodes
by node uuid and id. This filter API is used
in many places throughout the code base. It is
natural to expect that this API would allow us to
filter by node id and uuid in addtion to the other
supported parameters. This also fixes a 3 year old bug.

This change from lucasagomes has a bug:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/197141/

In conductor/manager.py, he calls _fail_if_in_state()
and uses the node_id as a filter. However this filter
effectively does nothing because sqalchemy does not
know how to filter by node id on the backend. My changes
fix this problem and make the API more intuitive

The repo server now hosts a native pypi-server. This new server allows
us to use a native pip install instead of our existing ""find-links""
approach. Moving to the native pypi server is not only faster, it is also
more scalable. This change agments our existing wheel lockdown by
setting the index to our new pypi-server and defining an online
constraint file in the pip.conf.

Additional checks have been set within the configuration task file so
that we're confirming pip can be locked down prior to setting the
pip.conf file which can, and will break a deployment if configured
incorrectly. These tasks will only fire when the option
`pip_lock_to_internal_repo` has been set to ""true"" making them a no-op
by default.

In I85fefc6ce186bb6808ac37a9ea79a50e29671115 the format for
lxc_host_machine_volume_size was changed from a forced GB
value to a value where the size can be specified by the user.

Unfortunately this totally breaks previous settings, as
demonstrated by the need to implement this patch to get the
integrated build to work again:
https://review.openstack.org/544724

Unfortunately this means that any value set in any previous
series will also fail, meaning that an upgrade from a previous
setting in a previous or same series will fail.

This is not an acceptable outcome, so this patch forces it
back to using Gigabytes as documented and makes sure it's
consistent across the old/new systemd implementations. It also
converts any other values set (perhaps with trailing G/K) to
use G so that regardles sof someone setting it in the interim
state it will still work.

See the `Identity API reference`_ for more information on authenticating with and managing application credentials. .. _`Identity API reference`: https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3/index.html#application-credentials Managing Application Credentials ================================ Create an application credential using python-keystoneclient: .. code-block:: python >>> keystone = client.Client(session=mysession) >>> app_cred = keystone.application_credentials.create( ... name='monitoring' ... ) >>> pprint.pprint(app_cred.to_dict()) {u'description': None, u'expires_at': None, u'id': u'aa809205ed614a0e854bac92c0768bb9', u'links': {u'self': u'http://192.168.122.247/identity/v3/users/1d1b5c244ee64c6e9356947322570120/application_credentials/aa809205ed614a0e854bac92c0768bb9'}, u'name': u'monitoring', u'project_id': u'73cd55a3f3f7446d8256889339e7f02f', u'roles': [{u'domain_id': None, u'id': u'cdfd5fd0b0844bfa81b177a986e31063', u'name': u'Member'}, {u'domain_id': None, u'id': u'e82e7f3ad839443ab4d1ead88a8c267d', u'name': u'anotherrole'}], u'secret': u'oKce6DOC_WcZoE13l3eXspfxhjO0VlO2n5SG_XNdXVZTDZVFF163a5p03pei56DhJxkd62x-zX-hEQ8VyWmYnA', u'unrestricted': False} The only required parameter is a name. The application credential is created for the project to which the user is currently scoped with the same role assignments the user has on that project. Keystone will automatically generate a secret string that will be revealed once at creation time. You can also provide your own secret, if desired: .. code-block:: python >>> keystone = client.Client(session=mysession) >>> app_cred = keystone.application_credentials.create( ... name='monitoring', ... secret='securesecret' ... ) >>> pprint.pprint(app_cred.to_dict()) {u'description': None, u'expires_at': None, u'id': u'63022d09c923497887f44d33b1ab61e8', u'links': {u'self': u'http://192.168.122.247/identity/v3/users/1d1b5c244ee64c6e9356947322570120/application_credentials/63022d09c923497887f44d33b1ab61e8'}, u'name': u'monitoring', u'project_id': u'73cd55a3f3f7446d8256889339e7f02f', u'roles': [{u'domain_id': None, u'id': u'e82e7f3ad839443ab4d1ead88a8c267d', u'name': u'anotherrole'}, {u'domain_id': None, u'id': u'cdfd5fd0b0844bfa81b177a986e31063', u'name': u'Member'}], u'secret': u'securesecret', u'unrestricted': False} The secret is hashed before it is stored, so the original secret is not retrievable after creation. If the secret is lost, a new application credential must be created. If none are provided, the application credential is created with the same role assignments on the project that the user has. You can find out what role assignments you have on a project by examining your token or your keystoneauth session: .. code-block:: python >>> mysession.auth.auth_ref.role_names [u'anotherrole', u'Member'] If you have more than one role assignment on a project, you can grant your application credential only a subset of your role assignments if desired. This is useful if you have administrator privileges on a project but only want the application to have basic membership privileges, or if you have basic membership privileges but want the application to only have read-only privileges. You cannot grant the application a role assignment that your user does not already have; for instance, if you are an admin on a project, and you want your application to have read-only access to the project, you must acquire a read-only role assignment on that project yourself before you can delegate it to the application credential. Removing a user's role assignment on a project will invalidate the user's application credentials for that project. .. code-block:: python >>> app_cred = keystone.application_credentials.create( ... name='monitoring', ... roles=[{'name': 'Member'}] ... ) >>> pprint.pprint(app_cred.to_dict()) {u'description': None, u'expires_at': None, u'id': u'7f293ac53f4e47a6826dc42f6a6a66d9', u'links': {u'self': u'http://192.168.122.247/identity/v3/users/1d1b5c244ee64c6e9356947322570120/application_credentials/7f293ac53f4e47a6826dc42f6a6a66d9'}, u'name': u'monitoring', u'project_id': u'73cd55a3f3f7446d8256889339e7f02f', u'roles': [{u'domain_id': None, u'id': u'cdfd5fd0b0844bfa81b177a986e31063', u'name': u'Member'}], u'secret': u'6Oq8MrvaaeNb3GRBX79Svj1ALgAJwwbr9ECQYOyTWUidg8yDOgvJL4Yvtnm3p17XND8sYaQVYQPR-M8WdrbPbg', u'unrestricted': False} You can provide an expiration date for application credentials: .. code-block:: python >>> expires = datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(days=365) >>> app_cred = keystone.application_credentials.create( ... name='monitoring', ... expires_at=expires ... ) >>> pprint.pprint(app_cred.to_dict()) {u'description': None, u'expires_at': u'2019-02-12T20:52:43.895274', u'id': u'888c5b30428349d7af19d0e9e05229fd', u'links': {u'self': u'http://192.168.122.247/identity/v3/users/1d1b5c244ee64c6e9356947322570120/application_credentials/888c5b30428349d7af19d0e9e05229fd'}, u'name': u'monitoring', u'project_id': u'73cd55a3f3f7446d8256889339e7f02f', u'roles': [{u'domain_id': None, u'id': u'e82e7f3ad839443ab4d1ead88a8c267d', u'name': u'anotherrole'}, {u'domain_id': None, u'id': u'cdfd5fd0b0844bfa81b177a986e31063', u'name': u'Member'}], u'secret': u'PXyLkmBSz9TbCS4G32kNqQIFpnJx2euFR7RIBmM5g97ZhH8KvECEmCU1BIdmD8NuKrUfh77nugwKjlUbP1mD6g', u'unrestricted': False} By default, application credentials are restricted from creating or deleting other application credentials and from creating or deleting trusts.

For a service using keystonemiddleware to authenticate with keystone, the auth section would look like this: .. code-block:: ini [keystone_authtoken] auth_url = https://keystone.server/identity/v3 auth_type = v3applicationcredential application_credential_id = 6cb5fa6a13184e6fab65ba2108adf50c application_credential_secret= glance_secret You can also identify your application credential with its name and the name or ID of its owner. For example: .. code-block:: ini [keystone_authtoken] auth_url = https://keystone.server/identity/v3 auth_type = v3applicationcredential username = glance user_domain_name = Default application_credential_name = glance_cred application_credential_secret = glance_secret Rotating Application Credentials ================================ A user can create multiple application credentials with the same role assignments on the same project. This allows the application credential to be gracefully rotated with minimal or no downtime for your application. In contrast, changing a service user's password results in immediate downtime for any application using that password until the application can be updated with the new password. .. note:: Rotating application credentials is essential if a team member who has knowledge of the application credential identifier and secret leaves the team for any reason. Rotating application credentials is also recommended as part of regular application maintenance. Rotating an application credential is a simple process: #. Create a new application credential. Application credential names must be unique within the user's set of application credentials, so this new application credential must not have the same name as the old one. #. Update your application's configuration to use the new ID (or name and user identifier) and the new secret. For a distributed application, this can be done one node at a time. #. When your application is fully set up with the new application credential, delete the old one. ",,261,7

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

The template generated by ResourceGroup should include outputs that
reference any needed resource attributes. However, previously it only did
so when rolling updates were not enabled by an update_policy.

The tests are trivially different than the patch on master, only because
ce120bfda848e55ba06b606681e7c1b8ae3de923 is not present in Pike.

YAQL introduced a backward incompatible change in one of its minor

It changes the expected behavior of groupBy() aggregator, so we need to
update our queries otherwise it fails with a ""list index out of range""
error.

This patch separates indicators for reboot required and commit required.
It does this by adding two new keys (is_reboot_required and
is_commit_required) to the dictionary returned by set/create/modify
operations while continuing to return the commit_required key for
backwards compatibility.

The commit_required key should be considered deprecated at this time and
it will be removed in a future patch.

The is_reboot_required key has an enumerated value that can have three
possible values: true, optional, and false.  This allows the return of
optional for RAID operations that can return this value.

Currently on unexpected python error we only log the error message, e.g.
""NoneType object is not iterable"" or just KeyError missing key. This is
obviously not helping debugging too much.

This change splits error handling into separate handling of IronicException
and other exceptions.

For IronicException: only log the error message, remove redundant ""Error: ""
from the last_error message.

For other exceptions: log traceback, mention that the exception was not
expected.

Finally, move logging to the top of the error handling helper to make sure
it never gets lost.

In patch #448525, there will be one hidden acount per account which
has tiered container. The following table is example.

+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| original (user defined) |  derivative (automatically created by daemons) |
+-----------+-------------+----------------+----------------+--------------+
|    acc    |     con     |      acc       |      con       | policy index |
+-----------+-------------+----------------+----------------+--------------+
|   acc1    |    con1     |  .tiered_acc1  |    1_con1      |      1       |
|   acc1    |    con1     |  .tiered_acc1  |    2_con1      |      2       |
|   acc1    |    con2     |  .tiered_acc1  |    2_con2      |      2       |
|   acc2    |    con3     |  .tiered_acc2  |    1_con3      |      1       |
+-----------+-------------+----------------+----------------+--------------+

In this case, tiering daemons need to make derivative containers
list, in '.tiering_info' account, because tiering daemon need to GET
derivative containers to know timestamps of objects in derivative
containers.

There is a counterproposal of hidden derivative account names and
contaienr names. In the counterproposal, one hidden account will
be used, and original account name and original container name
will be included in derivative container name. The following table
is example.

+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| original (user defined) |  derivative (automatically created by daemons) |
+-----------+-------------+------------+--------------------+--------------+
|    acc    |     con     |    acc     |        con         | policy index |
+-----------+-------------+------------+--------------------+--------------+
|   acc1    |    con1     |  .tiered   | quote(acc1/con1/1) |      1       |
|   acc1    |    con1     |  .tiered   | quote(acc1/con1/2) |      2       |
|   acc1    |    con2     |  .tiered   | quote(acc1/con2/2) |      2       |
|   acc2    |    con3     |  .tiered   | quote(acc2/con3/1) |      1       |
+-----------+-------------+------------+--------------------+--------------+
Note: quote is function of swift.common.utils.quote

In this case, tiering daemons don't need to make derivative container
list, because result of GET '.tiered' account is derivative containers
list.

There is Pros and Cons in each proposal.
Proposal of patch #448525:
    Pros: If each original account don't have many containers,
          counts of each derivative account's containers will not be
          large.
    Cons: Tiering daemons should make derivative containers list.

Counterproposal:
    Pros: Derivative containers list is not required.
    Cons: Count of '.tiered' account's containers can be large,
          because all derivative containers in Swift is stored in
          the '.tiered' account.

This patch is implementation example of the counterproposal for discussion.

Add a new label 'cert_manager_api' to kubernetes clusters controlling the
enable/disable of the kubernetes certificate manager api.

The same cluster cert/key pair is used by this api. The heat agent is used
to install the key in the master node(s), as this is required for kubernetes
to later sign new certificate requests.

The master template init order is changed so the heat agent is launched
previous to enabling the services - the controller manager requires the CA key
to be locally available before being launched.

Tis commit enhances openstack_dashboard.test.helpers.TestCase
.add_panel_mocks() method to more flexible way.
Now the mock definitions are defined in the test settings and
setUp() in unit tests and selenium tests sets up mocks defined in
the test settings TEST_GLOBAL_MOCKS_ON_PANELS.

This is a preparation for drop of deprecated options (enable_firewall
and enable_vpn). They were marked as deprecated long ago, but they are
still kept just because we need a lot of changes in unit tests if dropped.
By this change, we no longer need to use settings just for testing.

enable_firewall/enable_vpn=False are dropped (default is True)
to confirm this change works well.

When a user doesn't match the policy rules of a panel then the panel tab
is removed from the menu of the left, but panel views are still
accessible using directly the url (ex /admin/flavors/).

In most of the case, views won't work correctly because of the lack of
right in the backend, but it may cause trouble when you play with
policies.

I think it could be more elegant to return directly a ""You are not
authorized to access this page"" from the frontend when user try to
access a view of a panel (via url) without matching the policy rules.

This commit introduces metaextract as a new dependency.metaextract
can be use to get metadata via a distutil command from a sdist tarball.

renderspec has now a new --archive switch to set a archive file (tar.gz and
zip are supported)
If --archive is given, the render context has a new {{ requires }} variable
which can be used like:

{% for req in requires() %}
Requires:       {{ req }}
{% endfor %}

The {{ requires }} variable is a list containing the already converted
(depending on the spec-style) pypi name and the version.

TODOs/OpenQuestions:
- about used versions: if a archive file contains a version for a pypi name and
  a requirements file is given, which version should be used?
- splitting requires per subpackage:
  * imo the filtering of requires must be done in the code (not in the template
    via {% if ... %}.
  * introduce a archive.yaml config file which can create filters and add a new
    --archive-config switch to renderspec. The config file could look like:
    ---
    tag1:
    - oslosphinx,sphinx,reno
    tag2:
    - ...

    Then the {{ requires() }} would get extra parameters like 'tag' and
    'tag_modifier' . I.e. {{ requires('tag1', 'include') would create a list
    with only the packages from 'tag1' (if the packages are in the {{ requires }}
    list.
    Not sure if this is a good proposal...
  * a more radical approach would be to define the whole subpackages in a config
    file and create a {{ subpkg }} context function...
  * Any better/other ideas?

aliasColors: {} bars: false dashLength: 10 dashes: false datasource: prometheus description: |- proposals_committed_total records the total number of consensus proposals committed. This gauge should increase over time if the cluster is healthy. Several healthy members of an etcd cluster may have different total committed proposals at once. This discrepancy may be due to recovering from peers after starting, lagging behind the leader, or being the leader and therefore having the most commits. It is important to monitor this metric across all the members in the cluster; a consistently large lag between a single member and its leader indicates that member is slow or unhealthy. proposals_applied_total records the total number of consensus proposals applied. The etcd server applies every committed proposal asynchronously. The difference between proposals_committed_total and proposals_applied_total should usually be small (within a few thousands even under high load). If the difference between them continues to rise, it indicates that the etcd server is overloaded. This might happen when applying expensive queries like heavy range queries or large txn operations. fill: 1 id: 2 legend: alignAsTable: true avg: true current: true max: true min: false rightSide: false show: true total: false values: true lines: true linewidth: 1 links: [] nullPointMode: 'null' percentage: false pointradius: 5 points: false renderer: flot seriesOverrides: [] spaceLength: 10 span: 6 stack: false steppedLine: false targets: - expr: sum(rate(etcd_server_proposals_committed_total[5m])) format: time_series intervalFactor: 2 legendFormat: total number of consensus proposals committed metric: '' refId: A step: 60 - expr: sum(rate(etcd_server_proposals_applied_total[5m])) format: time_series intervalFactor: 2 legendFormat: total number of consensus proposals applied metric: '' refId: B step: 60 thresholds: [] timeFrom: timeShift: title: The total number of consensus proposals committed tooltip: shared: true sort: 0 value_type: individual type: graph xaxis: buckets: mode: time name: show: true values: [] yaxes: - format: short label: logBase: 1 max: min: show: true - format: short label: '' logBase: 1 max: min: show: true - aliasColors: {} bars: false dashLength: 10 dashes: false datasource: prometheus description: indicates how many proposals are queued to commit.

We use an SSH bastion host which we do our deployment through. The
deployment host doesn't have direct access to the same network as the
host. As a result the venv local checksum lookup fails.

I have described this here:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1689283

This is a simple fix for this problem, assuming everything is good it
will need repeating in multiple places in the code base.

In addition, this pins Rally's sha.

If the boot-volume creation fails, the data volume is left in state
""in-use"", attached to the server which is now in ""error"" state.
The user can't detach the volume because of the server's error state.

They can delete the server, which then leaves the volume apparently
attached to a server that no longer exists, which is being fixed
separately: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/340614/

The only way out of this is to ask an administrator to reset the state of
the data volume (this option is not available to regular users by
default policy).

This change fixes the problem in the compute service such that
when the creation fails, compute manager detaches the created volumes
before putting the VM into error state. Then you can delete the instance
without care about attached volumes.

Currently there is no way to have DHCP agents not announce DNS servers
for a subnet. The current behaviour when the dns_nameservers option is
set to '0.0.0.0' is that each agent will only announce itself instead of
announcing the list of all dhcp agents for that subnet, which seems not
too useful. So we redefine the meaning of this option to instruct the
DHCP agent to not announce any DNS server in that case.

Actually, going back to square one, it would be more natural to swap the
meaning of ""option unset"" and ""option 0.0.0.0"", but that would change
the default behaviour for all existing installation and thus does not
seem feasible.

The old behaviour was that each DHCP agent would supply only its own IP address as the DNS server to its clients. The new behaviour is that the DHCP agent will not supply any DNS server IP address at all. ",,93,6

conntrack updates when ports are removed or rules are changed
can take a long time to process.  By enqueuing these to a set

they are processed in the background.

This commit removes the single quotes from all the stestr run commands
in the tox.ini. These were originally added as a workaround from the
ostestr days to ensure people could run a subset of tests with a regex
like:

  tox -epy27 regex

With the switch to stestr this is no longer needed because stestr treats
extra arguments as a filter regex. Quoting the posargs has a negative
effect because '--' parameters are treated as a string on input instead
of a parameter.

Fixing this also uncovered another issue in the stestr commands for the
functional jobs. The CLI arg for stestr versions <=1.1.0 is
--group_regex not --group-regex. This commit fixes this to make those
jobs pass without the quotes.

The new stable upper-constraints file is only available
after the openstack/requirements repository is branched.
This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements
repository has been branched.

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run
with a local copy of the file and defaults to the master branch.
However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration
on developers' local systems, so please wait until after the
requirements repository is branched to merge the patch.

SRDF/Metro allows a remotely replicated (SRDF) secondary device
to be read/write accessible to the host, taking on the external
identity of the primary device (geometry, device WWN, and so on).
Both the primary and secondary devices may then appear as a single
virtual device across the two SRDF paired arrays. With both devices
being accessible, the host can read and write to both primary and
secondary devices, with SRDF/Metro ensuring each copy remains current
and consistent, addressing any write conflicts which may occur.
This patch adds this functionality to the VMAX cinder driver.

When containerizing mistral-executor, we need to mount /var/lib/mistral so
our operators can get the config-download logs when the undercloud is
containerized and config-download is used to deploy the overcloud.

To help our operators, we also create /var/lib/mistral/readme.txt so
they know where to find the config-download data.

In ResourceGroup, we (unwisely in retrospect) allow blacklisting of
resources by reference ID (i.e. physical resource ID in most cases). In
order to both determine whether a removal policy entry was an existing
resource name and (if not) to find the resource by physical ID, we would
always load the nested stack into memory.

To avoid this, unconditionally create an output in the nested stack that
returns a mapping of all the resource reference IDs and use it for finding
a resource with a matching reference ID. Only if the output is not
available (because the nested stack hasn't been updated since prior to the
output being defined), fall back to the old way of doing it.

Avoid looking up IDs for names that already appear in the blacklist
(because they were blacklisted in a previous update and have been removed
from the stack.)

Since this is more expensive in time (though hopefully cheaper in space),
update the blacklist only once on resource creation and whenever it
actually changes during an update. This is accomplished by moving the
update to a separate function that is called explicitly, rather than making
it a side-effect of getting the current blacklist (which occurs up to 4
times in each create/update).

This also avoids updating the blacklist during a preview, which the
previous code erroneously did.

At the moment, all drivers are being installed for Gnocchi even
if some of them are not used.  This also means that some libraries
are being built which are not needed (such as for Ceph or Swift
when using file storage).

This patch switches the behaviour to install only the extra for
the driver in use.

We had a workaround for this in the shade code, but it really should
have been in the CloudRegion code.

The underlying issue here is that neutron didn't have a version
discovery document, and also that neutronclient just hard-coded an

no way around also doing an append - but we can do our best to not do

When constructing a container listing from shards' listings, the
actual listing length may different from the root container's object
count if shard containers have not updated the root stats.

Before, the X-Container-Object-Count returned to the client was always
the value returned by the root container. With this patch that value
is overridden *when appropriate* by the actual listing length.  This
is only appropriate when the listing is unconstrained (no marker etc.)
and does not get capped by the listng length limit.  In practice this
will only apply to shrinking sharded containers, but also to test
conditions where this patch should make listing results more
predictable.

There are critical known issues related to the cluster driver and
passthrough disks.

When an instance is failed over, the instance attached volumes need
to be accessible on the destination host. This will not happen
transparently for such disks, for which reason the instance may
bounce between a few nodes and then end up in error state,
basically defeating the purpose of the cluster driver.

This change ensures that the Hyper-V Cluster driver rejects
iSCSI/FC Cinder volumes, raising an error that describes possible
alternatives.

While Libvirt exposes the Cinder volume id as disk serial id (visible in /dev/disk/by-id/), this is not possible in case of Hyper-V. The mountpoints exposed by Nova (e.g. /dev/sd*) are not a reliable source either (which mostly stands for other Nova drivers as well). Starting with Queens, the Hyper-V driver includes disk address information in the instance metadata, accessible on the guest side through the metadata service. This also applies to untagged volume attachments. .. note:: The config drive should not be relied upon when fetching disk metadata as it never gets updated after an instance is created. Here's an example: .. code-block:: bash nova volume-attach cirros 1517bb04-38ed-4b4a-bef3-21bec7d38792 vm_fip=""192.168.42.74"" cmd=""curl -s 169.254.169.254/openstack/latest/meta_data.json"" ssh_opts=( -o ""StrictHostKeyChecking no"" -o ""UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null"" ) metadata=`ssh ""${ssh_opts[@]}"" ""cirros@$vm_fip"" $cmd` echo $metadata | sed 's/\""random_seed\"": \""[^""]*\"", //' | python -m json.tool # Sample output # # { # ""availability_zone"": ""nova"", # ""devices"": [ # { # ""address"": ""0:0:0:0"", # ""bus"": ""scsi"", # ""serial"": ""1517bb04-38ed-4b4a-bef3-21bec7d38792"", # ""tags"": [], # ""type"": ""disk"" # } # ], # ""hostname"": ""cirros.novalocal"", # ""launch_index"": 0, # ""name"": ""cirros"", # ""project_id"": ""3a8199184dfc4821ab01f9cbd72f905e"", # ""uuid"": ""f0a09969-d477-4d2f-9ad3-3e561226d49d"" # } # Now that we have the disk SCSI address, we may fetch its path. file `find /dev/disk/by-path | grep ""scsi-0:0:0:0""` # Sample output # /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:10.0-scsi-0:0:0:0: symbolic link to ../../sdb The volumes may be identified in a similar way in case of Windows guests as well. Online volume extend ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Hyper-V driver supports online Cinder volume resize. Still, there are a few cases in which this feature is not available: * SMB backed volumes * Some iSCSI backends where the online resize operation impacts connected initiators. For example, when using the Cinder LVM driver and TGT, the iSCSI targets are actually recreated during the process. The MS iSCSI initiator will attempt to reconnect but TGT will report that the target does not exist, for which reason no reconnect attempts will be performed.

The current implementation wipes out the novnc/spice directory
every single time the playbook executes. While it does replace
it afterwards it does not fire a notifier to make the service
restart, resulting in the service failing.

This patch makes the install process idempotent - it will only
wipe out the directory if it does not look the way it is
expected to look. It also fires the notifier to restart services
if the git repo changes.

This should ensure that novnc/spice restart properly on upgrades
and that there are no changes/restarts for the service if the git
SHA or software does not change.

Backport note:
The 'Manage LB' handler notification is removed as it is not
present in ocata.

The underlying pyasn1 library has a notion of `schema` and

regular Python operators as values because `schema` does

This fix turns a couple of `NoSuchInstance` schema

with the latest pysnmp which removed the default initializer

virtualenv-tools has a bug which gets triggered in gates: it can't
change the shebang of a virtualenv python bin/ files if they
were generated with a virtualenv script whose shebang ends with
python2 instead of python.

Because we can't modify virtualenv-tools, we use shell scripts
instead.
