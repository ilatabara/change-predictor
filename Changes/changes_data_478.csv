When using distributed floating IPs, we set the external MAC
address and logical port fields regardless whether the LSP
is up. For the particular use of Octavia LB VIP, which doesn't
ever get bound, the floating IP associated to it will never
get the flows installed by ovn-controller.

This patch changes the mechanism so that the DNAT entries get
updated only on port up/down changes. If the port remains
down, the external_mac will be cleared and traffic to those
FIPs will still go through the centralized router.
When a port gets bound to a chassis, if DVR is enabled, the
mac_address field will be populated and traffic will go to
the compute node.

There is a case where there can be more than one build_name
with the same run_at[1] and without this change the request in [1]
will result in a KeyError[2]

The run_aggregator method is now updated to work with runs with
more than one build_name so that the expected_responses from
the unit tests make more sense and it makes it more ready to be
used for displaying run times in the grouped runs page.

Scheduler hints are not really documented very well at all except
for being mentioned per scheduler filter in the admin configuration
guide, nor are they documented within relation to flavor extra
specs which are both used for impacting scheduling decisions and
are choices that a deployer has to make based on how they configure
their cloud.

This change adds a document about scheduler hints and how they are
similar to and different from flavor extra specs, including end
user discoverability and interoperability, and thoughts on which
should be used if writing a custom scheduler filter.

The TODO in the API guide is also resolved by linking to this
document.

The cancel_all_events function was incorrectly assuming
that event tags didn't have dashes in them, but they all
do since they are either port or volume IDs, which are UUIDs.

Instead of just storing our event data indexed by the composite
event key, we should just store the name and tag distinctly so
that there is no question about how to dissect the two from the
key later. This is all internal record-keeping inside of the
compute manager, so we can change it to whatever we want.

This includes a slight change to the internal virtapi interface
for wait_for_instance_event(), which removes the ability to
pass composite event keys as strings instead of (name, tag)
tuples. In reality, none of the virt code was using the key string
format, so this just cleans up a few tests that were. It makes
that interface less ambiguous, which is good anyway.

Problem description =================== The response of ``GET /allocation_candidates`` API provides two fields of ``allocation_requests`` and ``provider_summaries``. The callers, like the filter scheduler in nova, would use information in ``provider_summaries`` in sorting or filtering providers to allocate consumers. However, currently ``provider_summaries`` doesn't contain resources that aren't requested. Use Cases --------- As a user of the placement API, I want to be able to get all the resource information of the providers in ``allocation_requests`` for making further sorting and filtering decisions. For example, when I deploy an instance with VCPU, MEMORY_MB, and DISK_GB, I don't want to deploy this instance to hosts with VGPU to save the resource for instances with VGPU. Proposed change =============== Change ``GET /allocation_candidates`` API to include all the resouce class inventories for each provider in ``provider_summaries`` even if the resource classes are not requested. Alternatives ------------ We can keep things as they are, but we take this to enable more advanced scheduling. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- For example, ``GET /allocation_candidates?resources=VCPU:1`` used to include only VCPU information in the response: .. code-block:: javascript { ""allocation_requests"": [ { ""allocations"": { ""35791f28-fb45-4717-9ea9-435b3ef7c3b3"": { ""resources"": { ""VCPU"": 1 } } } }, ], ""provider_summaries"": { ""35791f28-fb45-4717-9ea9-435b3ef7c3b3"": { ""resources"": { ""VCPU"": { ""used"": 0, ""capacity"": 384 }, } } } } With a new microverion, it now includes all the resource class inventories: .. code-block:: javascript { ""allocation_requests"": [ { ""allocations"": { ""35791f28-fb45-4717-9ea9-435b3ef7c3b3"": { ""resources"": { ""VCPU"": 1 } } } }, ], ""provider_summaries"": { ""35791f28-fb45-4717-9ea9-435b3ef7c3b3"": { ""resources"": { ""VCPU"": { ""used"": 0, ""capacity"": 384 }, ""MEMORY_MB"": { ""used"": 0, ""capacity"": 196608 } ""DISK_GB"": { ""used"": 0, ""capacity"": 1900 } } } } } Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Tetsuro Nakamura (tetsuro) Work Items ---------- * Add all resource class inventories in ``provider_summaries`` Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Provide new gabbi tests as well as unit tests. Documentation Impact ==================== The new behavior with the new microversion should be well described in the release note and in the `placement api-ref`_ document. `Microversion history`_ document will be also updated.

In the legacy path we reparse a resource definition to refer to a different
StackDefinition when copying a resource definition into the existing
template (as the resource is updated) or into the backup stack's template.
However, the resources 'condition' may reference conditionals that are not
defined in the template it is being copied into (e.g. during a stack update
that creates a new condition), and in this case the destination template
will become unusable.

Since the fact that we care about the resource definition at all indicates
that the condition was enabled, just ignore the condition after reparsing.
This is consistent with what we do for 'if' macros, which is to resolve the
condition part during reparsing.

Cinder API supports os-force_detach, which once invoked can call the
driver finalize_connection passing a 'None' connector. When receiving
this, the driver should handle this call by terminating every

This patch fixes this behavior for NetApp ONTAP iSCSI and FC drivers.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

Some users may not want *_image_location operations to be
restricted to role:admin so this patch allows that to be
configurable and sets the default to be False since
enabling this by default is breaking RBD COW clones in

For migration of services to execution under Python 3 add support
for a Charm class to declare a set of packages to purge on upgrade.

This allows the target release Charm class to remove Python 2
modules installed as part of prior charm versions.

After the purge call, autoremove will also be called to purge any
other packages that where indirectly installed.

Add new python_version attribute for charm classes, supporting
conditional install of python{3}-memcache for token caching.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

We always run DB sync in deploy_tasks, ensuring that the database is
up to date. We should follow up with online data migrations
too.

Doing this via docker_config has 2 purposes:

* We can easily ensure this happens in a container with the right
  config files mounted.

* We can even apply this via a minor update. This is important because
  we'll have to backport this all the way to Pike and apply it there
  using Pike containers, before upgrading to Queens containers.

There's an additional issue to consider: In Puppet service variant we
ran the online migrations for release X before upgrading to X+1, but
the proposed Docker variant migrations for X run with upgrade to
X. This means that when switching from non-containerized to
containerized, we'll need to run migrations twice, to correctly switch
between the aforementioned approaches.

Problem description =================== In an ideal world, we could tell when a VM looks unable to move, and warn the operator sooner that the completion timeout. This was the progress timeout. Sadly we do not get enough information from QEMU and libvirt to correctly detect this case. As we were were sampling a saw tooth wave, it was possible for us to think little progress was being made, when in fact that was not the case. In addition, only memory was being monitoring, so large block_migrations always looked like they were making no progress. Last cycle we deprecated that progress timeout, and disabled it by default. Given there is no quick way to make that work, it should be removed in Pike. The automatic post-copy is using the same flawed data, so that logic should also be removed. Nova currently optimizes for limited guest downtime, over ensuring the live-migration operation always succeeds. When performing a host maintenance, operators may want to move all VMs from the affected host to an unaffected host. In some cases, the VM could be too busy to move before the completion timeout, and currently that means the live-migration will fail with a timeout error. Automatic post-copy used to be able to help with this use case, ensuring Nova does its best to ensure the live-migration completes, at the cost of a little more VM downtime. We should look at a replacement for automatic post-copy. Use Cases --------- * Operators wants to patch a host and want to move all the VM's out of that host, with minimal impact to the VMs, so they use live-migration. If the VM isn't live-migrated there will be significant VM downtime, so its better to take a little more VM downtime during the live-migration so the VM is able to avoid the much larger amount of downtime should the VM not get moved by the live-migration. Proposed change =============== * Config option ``libvirt.live_migration_progress_timeout`` was deprecated in Ocata, and can now be removed. * Curent logic in libvirt driver to auto trigger post-copy will be removed. * A new configuration option ``libvirt.live_migration_timeout_action`` will be added. This new option will have choice to ``abort`` (default) or ``force_complete``. This option will determine what actions will be taken against a VM after ``live_migration_completion_timeout`` expires. Currently nova just aborts the LM operation after completion timeout expires. By default, we keep the same behavior of aborting after completion timeout. Please note the ``abort`` and ``force_complete`` actions that are options in ``live_migration_timeout_action`` config option are the same as if you were to call the existing REST APIs of the same name. In particular, ``force_complete`` will either pause the VM or trigger post_copy depending on if post copy is enabled and available. Alternatives ------------ We could just remove the automatic post copy logic and not replace it, but this stops us helping operators with the above use case.

This patch is fixing a problem which left the external/gateway's router
port with status DOWN even after the port was bound to a chassis.

Since the Logical_Router_Port table in OVNNB does not have a ""up"" column
(like the Logical_Switch_Port table has) the status of those ports can
not be updpated based on it. Therefore, this patch uses the ""chassis""
column for that. If the router port has the ""chassis"" column in OVNNB
database set, the binding and status ACTIVE will be set in Neutron
otherwise it status will be udpated to DOWN (if it's not DOWN yet).

1. it generates huge amount of logs which are not really useful
2. it crashes when there is an instance with non-ascii name

Providing dname path for ceph-disk is unsafe, the prepare command
uses gdisk which breaks the dname symlinks.

This moves back the generic upgrade process

to the run_tests.sh script.

Instead if solves the known python-chardet
dependency bug for requests package for RPM
packaging in the repos.pp manifest.

This is because we need to fix that bug when

similar bugs in the future now that updates

A new feature has been introduced in core OVN which allows to define
a group of ports and assign ACLs to those. This patch is making use
of the new feature if supported by the underlying OVS version.

As a result we'll be modelling Neutron Security Groups as OVN Port
Groups and we won't be adding one ACL per Security Group Rule per
port. Instead, just add one single ACL per Security Group. This will
also tackle the race conditions that we had for Address Sets as those
will just be used for Remote Security Groups and will be automatically
generated/deleted by core OVN in SB database upon Port Group creation/
deletion.

The major benefit of this patch is that we'll reduce the number of
ACL's dramatically, resulting in a performance leap as discussed at:
https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-discuss/2018-February/046166.html

This patch will address the migration of old Security Groups being
modelled as Address Sets if the OVN schema supports the feature. This
migration will be performed from the OvnWorker which is holding a lock
on the IDL. This ensures that the migration happens from only one worker
in the cloud and after it's done, all the neutron-server instances are
ready to use Port Groups.

When new port is created in OVS it will now be tagged
with 4095 (DEAD_VLAN_TAG) by default.
Because of that such port will not work as trunk port and
will not be able to get traffic from other networks on same
host.
Neutron-openvswitch-agent will remove this DEAD_VLAN_TAG and
configure proper vlan_id for such port in its normal wiring
process.

In order to setup schema (kafka topics) please see [this](https://github.com/openstack/monasca-log-api/blob/master/devstack/plugin.sh#L198). ## Installation next to monasca-api **Monasca-Api** and **Monasca-Log-Api** can be installed next to each other. Each one has been designed to work with different aspects of monitoring. Therefore it is possible to proceed with installation as described [here](https://github.com/openstack/monasca-log-api/blob/master/devstack/). # Configuration 1. Clone the OpenStack Tempest repo, and cd to it. ```bash git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/tempest.git cd tempest ``` 2. Create a virtualenv for running the Tempest tests and activate it. For example in the Tempest root dir ```bash virtualenv .venv source .venv/bin/activate ``` 3. Install the Tempest requirements in the virtualenv. ```bash pip install \ -c https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/requirements/plain/upper-constraints.txt \ -r requirements.txt \ -r test-requirements.txt ``` 4. Create ```etc/tempest.conf``` in the Tempest root dir by running the following command: ```bash oslo-config-generator --config-file tempest/cmd/config-generator.tempest.conf --output-file etc/tempest.conf ``` Add the following sections to ```tempest.conf``` for testing using the monasca-vagrant environment. ```ini [identity] region = RegionOne auth_version = v3 uri = http://10.36.99.238/identity_admin/v2.0 uri_v3 = http://10.36.99.238/identity_admin/v3 user_lockout_failure_attempts = 2 user_locakout_duration = 5 user_unique_last_password_count = 2 admin_domain_scope = True [auth] tempest_roles = monasca-user admin_project_name = admin admin_domain_name = default admin_password = secretadmin admin_username = admin use_dynamic_credentials = True [monitoring] kibana_version = 4.6.3 api_version = v2.0 # or v3.0 ``` Edit the variable values in the identity section to match your particular monasca-vagrant environment. Best way to do this might be ```bash source devstack/openrc {username} {password} ``` and collect all relevant values using ```bash env | grep OS_ ``` An output will be similar to this one ```bash OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID=default OS_REGION_NAME=RegionOne OS_USER_DOMAIN_ID=default OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3 OS_PASSWORD=secretadmin OS_AUTH_TYPE=password OS_AUTH_URL=http://10.36.99.238/identity_admin OS_USERNAME=admin OS_TENANT_NAME=admin OS_VOLUME_API_VERSION=2 OS_NO_CACHE=True ``` 5. Create ```etc/logging.conf``` in the Tempest root dir by making a copying ```logging.conf.sample```. 6. Clone the monasca-log-api repo in a directory somewhere outside of the Tempest root dir. 7. Install the monasca-log-api in your venv, which will also register the Monasca Log Api Tempest Plugin as, monasca_log_api_tempest. cd into the monasca-log-api root directory. Making sure that the tempest virtual env is still active, run the following command. ``` pip install \ -c https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/requirements/plain/upper-constraints.txt \ -r requirements.txt \ -r test-requirements.txt python setup.py install ``` See the [OpenStack Tempest Plugin Interface](https://docs.openstack.org/tempest/latest/plugin.html), for more details on Tempest Plugins and the plugin registration process. # Running the Monasca Log Api Tempest The Monasca Tempest Tests can be run using a variety of methods including: 1. [Testr](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Testr) 2. [Os-testr](https://docs.openstack.org/os-testr/latest/) 3. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) 4. Tempest Scripts in Devstack ## Run the tests from the CLI using testr [Testr](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Testr) is a test runner that can be used to run the Tempest tests. 1. In the Tempest root dir, create a list of the Monasca Tempest Tests in a file. ```sh testr list-tests monasca_log_api_tempest > monasca_log_api_tempest ``` 2. Run the tests using testr ```sh testr run --load-list=monasca_log_api_tempest ``` You can also use testr to create a list of specific tests for your needs. ## Run the tests from the CLI using os-testr (no file necessary) [Os-testr](https://docs.openstack.org/os-testr/latest/) is a test wrapper that can be used to run the Monasca Tempest tests. 1. In the Tempest root dir: ``` ostestr --serial --regex monasca_log_api_tempest ``` ```--serial``` option is necessary here. Monasca Log Api tempest tests can't be run in parallel (default option in ostestr) because some tests depend on the same data and will randomly fail. ## Running/Debugging the Monasca Tempest Tests in PyCharm Assuming that you have already created a PyCharm project for the ```monasca-log-api``` do the following: 1. In PyCharm, Edit Configurations and add a new Python tests configuration by selecting Python tests->Nosetests. 2. Name the test. For example TestSingleLog. 3. Set the path to the script with the tests to run. For example, ~/repos/monasca-log-api/monasca_log_api_tempest/tests/test_single.py 4. Set the name of the Class to test. For example TestVersions. 5. Set the working directory to your local root Tempest repo. For example, ~/repos/tempest. 6. Select the Python interpreter for your project to be the same as the one virtualenv created above. For example, ~/repos/tempest/.venv 7. Run the tests. You should also be able to debug them. 8. Step and repeat for other tests. ## Run the tests from the CLI using tempest scripts in devstack 1. In /opt/stack/tempest, run ```./run_tempest.sh monasca_log_api_tempest``` 2. If asked to create a new virtual environment, select yes 3. Activate the virtual environment ```source .venv/bin/activate``` 4. In your monasca-log-api directory, run ```python setup.py install``` 5. In /opt/stack/tempest, run ```./run_tempest.sh monasca_log_api_tempest``` # References This section provides a few additional references that might be useful: * [Tempest - The OpenStack Integration Test Suite](https://docs.openstack.org/tempest/latest/overview.html#quickstart) * [Tempest Configuration Guide](https://github.com/openstack/tempest/blob/master/doc/source/configuration.rst#id1) * [OpenStack Tempest Plugin Interface](https://docs.openstack.org/tempest/latest/plugin.html) In addition to the above references, another source of information is the following OpenStack projects: * [Manila Tempest Tests](https://github.com/openstack/manila/tree/master/manila_tempest_tests) * [Congress Tempest Tests](https://github.com/openstack/congress/tree/master/congress_tempest_tests).

When a device is discovered, Cyborg updates resource inventories in Placement. * Instance placement/scheduling: Cyborg shall provide a filter and/or weigher that limit or prioritize hosts based on available accelerator resources. * Attaching accelerators to instances. In the compute node, Cyborg shall define a workflow based on interacting with Nova through a new os-acc library (like os-vif and os-brick). This spec addresses the first two aspects. There needs to be another spec to address the attachment of accelerators to instances. Cyborg also needs to handle some aspects for FPGAs without involving Nova, specifically FPGA programming and bitstream management. They will be covered in that spec too. This spec is independent of the other spec. This spec is common to all accelerators. Since FPGAs have more aspects to be considered than other devices, some sections may focus on FPGA-specific factors. The spec generally calls them out as FPGA-specific. However, the spec includes GPUs and other devices as well. Smart NICs based on FPGAs fall into two categories: those which expose the FPGA explicitly to the host, and those that do not. Cyborg's scope includes the former. This spec includes such devices, though the Cyborg-Neutron interaction is out of scope. Terminology =========== * Accelerator: The unit that can be assigned to an instance for offloading specific functionality. For non-FPGA devices, it is either the device itself or a virtualized version of it (e.g. vGPUs). For FPGAs, an accelerator is either the entire device, a region within the device or a function. * Bitstream: An FPGA image, usually a binary file, possibly with vendor-specific metadata. A bitstream may implement one or more functions. * Function: A specific functionality, such as matrix multiplication or video transcoding, usually represented as a string or UUID. This term may be used with multi-function devices, incl. FPGAs and other fixed function hardware like Intel QuickAssist. * Region: A part of the FPGA fabric which can be programmed without disrupting the rest of the fabric. If an FPGA does not support Partial Reconfiguration, the entire device constitutes one region. A region may implement one or more functions. NOTE: In this document, we use the term 'region' instead of device/region when referring to FPGAs. Here is an example diagram for an FPGA with multiple regions, and multiple functions in a region:: PCI A PCI B | | +-------|--------|-------------------+ | | | | | +----|--------|---+ +--------+ | | | +--|--+ +---|-+ | | | | | | | Fn A| | Fn B| | | | | | | +-----+ +-----+ | | | | | +-----------------+ +--------+ | | Region 1 Region 2 | | | +------------------------------------+ Problem description =================== Cyborg's representation and handling of accelerators needs to be consistent with Nova's Placement API. Specifically, they must be modeled in terms of Resource Providers (RPs), Resource Classes (RCs) and Traits. Though PCI Express is entrenched in the data center, some accelerators and NICs may be exposed to the host via some other protocol. Even with PCI, the connections between accelerator components and PCI functions exposed to the host may vary across devices. Accordingly, Cyborg should not represent accelerators as PCI functions. For instances that need accelerators, we need to define a way for Cyborg to be included seamlessly in the Nova scheduling workflow. Use Cases --------- We need to satisfy the following use cases for the tenant role: * Device as a Service (DaaS): The flavor asks for a device. * FPGA variation: The flavor asks for a device to which specific bitstream(s) can be applied. There are two variations for secure programming: * Static: The flavor specifies a bitstream. (Cyborg applies the bitstream before instance bringup. This is similar to AWS flow.) * Dynamic: The instance may request one or more bitstreams dynamically. (Cyborg receives the request and does the programming.) * Accelerated Function as a Service (AFaaS): The flavor asks for a function (e.g. ipsec) attached with my instance. An operator must be able to provide both Device as a Service and Accelerated Function as a Service in the same cluster, to serve all kinds of users: those who are device-agnostic, those using 3rd party bitstreams, and those using their own bitstreams (incl. developers). For Accelerated Function as a Service, the operator has two choices: * Pre-programmed: Do not allow orchestration to modify any function, for any of these reasons: * Only fixed function hardware is available. (E.g. ASICs.) * Operational simplicity. * Assure tenants of programming security, by doing all programming offline * through some audited process. * For FPGAs, allow orchestration to program as needed, to maximize flexibility and availability of resources. It is useful to consider the cross-product of above combinations as 4 discrete use cases: * Flavor requests AFaaS, Operator offers Pre-programmed model. * Flavor requests AFaaS, Operator offers orchestration-driven programming. * Flavor requests DaaS with a bitstream. (Cyborg programs it before bringup.) * Flavor requests DaaS, and the instance will request specific bitstreams. (Cyborg infrastructure receives the request and programs the bitstreams.) Note that the operator decides both the Service model (AFaaS or DaaS) and programming model (allowed or not). The goal for Cyborg is to provide the mechanisms to enable all these use cases. In this spec, we do not consider bitstream developer or device developer roles. Also, we assume that each accelerator device is dedicated to a compute node, rather than shared among several nodes. Proposed change =============== Synopsis -------- The outline of the proposed workflow is presented here, with details in later sections. Many of these represent changes for Cyborg. * Representation: * Cyborg represents device types (incl. FPGA region types) as resource classes. (Today, Cyborg discovers accelerators as PCI functions.) * Device-local memory can also be represented as a RC. (Not handled today.) * In addition, each device/region is also represented as an RP. This enables traits to be applied to it and other RPs/RCs to be contained within it. So, a device RP provides a single instance of that device type's RC. (Not handled today.) * Discovery: * Cyborg will discover accelerators, represent them as RPs/RCs and update Placement inventory. * It may possibly associate traits with device/region RPs, such as which bitstreams can fit a specific device/region. See later discussion on function-matching traits. (Not handled today.) * Flavors: * A flavor always asks for the RC of the specific device/region. e.g. CUSTOM_FPGA_INTEL_COMPUTE_ARRIA10. (Today, flavors are based on PCI white lists.) * In addition, optionally, the flavor extra specs may specify a bitstream ID (for DaaS static use case). * In addition, optionally, for requesting functions instead of devices, the flavor extra specs will specify the function UUID. * A flavor may ask for other RCs, such as local memory. * A Flavor may ask for multiple accelerators, using the granular resource request syntax. * If the flavor asks for multiple devices, and also bitstreams or functions in extra specs, the correlation of devices to extra specs needs to be worked out. * Scheduling workflow: * A request spec with a flavor comes to Nova conductor/scheduler. * Placement API returns the list of RPs (compute nodes + device/region) which contain the requested FPGA device types. * Cyborg will provide a custom filter which queries Cyborg DB. This will eliminate all candidate nodes and fail the request if: * If the use case is AFaaS + Preprogrammed, and the requested function is not available. * If the use case is DaaS, and the flavor-requested bitstream, if any, is not available. (E.g. the bitstream is out of licenses.) * FPGA-specific: For AFaaS, Cyborg will provide a custom weigher which queries Cyborg DB to prioritize nodes where the requested function (if any) is already available. This enables the orchestrator to choose the function if it already exists or else set the stage for reprogramming some device. * The request_spec goes to compute node (ignoring Cells for now). NOTE 1: This workflow picks not only a node but also a nested RP (device/region) within the node. NOTE 2: This flow is PCI-agnostic: no PCI whitelists involved. NOTE 3: This flow does not work when one device/region implements multiple functions and orchestration-driven programming is desired. This can be addressed later and is not a priority for Rocky release. See References. * Compute node workflow: * Nova compute calls os-acc/Cyborg. * FPGA-specific: If the request spec asks for a function X in extra specs, but X is not present in the selected region RP, Cyborg should program that region. * Cyborg has internal mappings associating the requested resource (device/function) with some handle that can be used to attach the resource to an instance (such as a PCI function). NOTE: This entire workflow is PCI-agnostic; we can use PCI or something else to attach instances to devices. Representation -------------- * Cyborg needs to decide which devices fall in the same RC. For example, consider a cluster with 3 different types of GPU. If all these GPUs are considered equivalent *from tenant perspective*, a single custom RC is enough to represent all of them, although the admin may have to treat them differently. However, if it is desired to expose those differences to users (tenants), they need to be represented as distinct RCs. * NOTE: 'Equivalent from tenant perspective' implies that tenant instance images have the drivers to handle any device of that RC. * NOTE: This implies that either Cyborg pre-decides what constitutes a RC, or provides knobs for operators to configure it. * Cyborg currently ties PCI functions to RCs. Instead, it should identify the RCs from the driver, and associate attach handles (such as PCI functions, mediated device UUIDs etc.) with them. * The Deployables model in Cyborg provides for a hierarchy, which corresponds to RP hierarchy. However, RCs and traits need to be reported by the Cyborg driver to the Cyborg agent. The Cyborg driver/agent interface needs to be enhanced to handle that. * Cyborg should associate RPs/RCs with Deployables in its internal DB. Here is the mapping from FPGA components to Nova Placement components:: FPGA +--------+------+ Resource Provider | Region +------+ Region Type +-+------+ Resource Class | Local Memory+-+ Function +----+------+ Extra Specs | Bitstream +---+ Operator knob +-----+ Trait Alternatives ------------ N/A Data model impact ----------------- Following changes are needed in Cyborg. * Do not disclose PCI details to Nova. Instead, publish RC/RP info to Nova, and keep RP-PCI mapping internally. * Driver/agent interface needs to report device/region types so that RCs ca be created. * Deployables table should track which RP corresponds to each Deployable. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- This change allows tenants to initiate FPGA bitstream programming. To mitigate the security impact, it is proposed that only 2 methods are offered for programming (flavor asks for a bitstream, or the running instance asks for specific bitstreams) and both are handled through Cyborg. There is no direct access from an instance to an FPGA. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ The main concern with scheduling for accelerators has been the potential cost of querying the Cyborg DB from a custom filter/weigher. There are many ways to mitigate performance issues: * Filter hosts as much as possible in Placement API, so that filters/weighers have fewer allocation candidates to handle. More on this below. * Have the weigher handle multiple hosts at one time, instead of one host at a time, by extending `BaseWeigher <https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/weights.py#L67>`_ and overriding `weigh_objects <https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/weights.py#L92>`_ (). * If the weigher must handle one host at a time for whatever reason, since it is maintained by Cyborg, it could directly query Cyborg DB rather than go through Cyborg REST API. This will be not unlike other weighers. For AFaaS, Placement returns all compute node RPs which contain the requested device type (but not necessarily the function). That can be a large list. To prune it as much as possible, here is a possible optimization for FPGAs. * Every device/region RP must be annotated with traits that indicate what functions can be realized in that device. For instance, if a region can accommodate the Ipsec and Video functions, then we add the traits CUSTOM_FPGA_FUNCTION_IPSEC and CUSTOM_FPGA_FUNCTION_VIDEO to that region's RP (except we would use UUIDs instead of names to begin with). * The flavor asks for the RC for that region, CUSTOM_FPGA_FUNCTION_IPSEC trait and specifies the 'ipsec' function (also as UUID) in the extra-specs. * The Placement API filters based on the trait as well, resulting in a smaller list of allocation candidates. This can result in a potentially large number of traits. It would also imply that every time a bit stream is uploaded to that cluster, Cyborg should create a new trait for every function that the bitstream implements, all compatible devices in the cluster must be updated with those traits, and new flavors must be created to reference those traits. Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- None Work Items ---------- * Decide the exact syntax in extra specs for requesting functions or bitstreams. * Decide how to associate multiple functions/bitstreams in extra specs with multiple devices in the flavor. * Decide specific changes needed in Cyborg conductor, db, agent and drivers. * Others: TBD Dependencies ============ * `Nova Granular Requests <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/queens/approved/granular-resource-requests.html>`_ Testing ======= For each vendor driver supported in this release, we need to integrate the corresponding FPGA type(s) in the CI infrastructure.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch

This will happen around the RC1 timeframe.

Recheck and merge this change once the requirements

The CI system will work with this patch before the requirements
repository is branched because zuul configues the job to run

However, accepting the patch will break the test configuration

The tempest utility that is configured here will take a snapshot.
After the snapashot and test run it will delete any resources that
are not in the snapshot.

If a tenant creates a resource outside of the test run it will also
be deleted.

This is something which is not desirable in a live lab.

This patch aims to provide control to the end-user to define how
to perform the final cleanup.

This is a mechanically generated patch to complete step 1 of moving
the zuul job settings out of project-config and into each project
repository.

Because there will be a separate patch on each branch, the branch
specifiers for branch-specific jobs have been removed.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some
cosmetic changes to the layout of the YAML file(s) as the contents are
normalized.

Instead of using openstack-tox-cover template, run the cover job
in the check queue only as the template would do.

The release-notes-jobs-python3 template is setup already, remove
indvidual jobs - they are redundant.

Remove jobs that are part of the templates.

The repo defined both voting and non-voting openstack-lower-constraints
jobs, only use the non-voting one. Remove the extra jobs. Add comment
on why the job is non-voting.

Update requirements constraint for packages since neutron and horizon
require newer versions.

Remove openstack-tox-docs jobs with required-projects - the way the job
is setup in tox.ini together with doc/requirements.txt, we do not need
these.

We always run DB sync in deploy_tasks, ensuring that the database is
up to date. We should follow up with online data migrations
too.

Doing this via docker_config has 2 purposes:

* We can easily ensure this happens in a container with the right
  config files mounted.

* We can even apply this via a minor update. This is important because
  we'll have to backport this all the way to Pike and apply it there
  using Pike containers, before upgrading to Queens containers.

There's an additional issue to consider: In Puppet service variant we
ran the online migrations for release X before upgrading to X+1, but
the proposed Docker variant migrations for X run with upgrade to
X. This means that when switching from non-containerized to
containerized, we'll need to run migrations twice, to correctly switch
between the aforementioned approaches.

A race condition may occur when concurrent agent scheduling happens,
since neutron-server uses multiple child processes to handle the agent
scheduling requests simultaneously.

The idea is to add inter-process synchronization locks on the top-level
scheduling operations of DHCP servers and routers to ensure the
scheduling decisions of a resource are atomic.

CI job now uses pip >= 10.0.0 to install the package.

In pip >= 10.0.0, if the package name is missing, the command
""pip install -U"" returns error, but in pip < 10.0.0 it
just logs warning.

So this patch make sure the package name exists first.

On hosts with dvr_snat agent mode, after restarting OVS agent,
sometimes the SNAT port is processed first instead of the distributed port.
The subnet_info is cached locally via get_subnet_for_dvr when either of these ports
are processed. However, it returns the MAC address of the port used to query
as the gateway for the subnet. Using the SNAT port, this puts the wrong
MAC as the gateway, causing some flows such as the DVR flows on br-int
for local src VMs to have the wrong MAC.

This patch fixes the get_subnet_for_dvr with fixed_ips as None for the csnat port,
as that causes the server side handler to fill in the subnet's actual gateway
rather than using the port's MAC.

This moves back the generic upgrade process
for packages after the repos are added back
to the run_tests.sh script.

Instead if solves the known python-chardet
dependency bug for requests package for RPM
packaging in the repos.pp manifest.

This is because we need to fix that bug when
running the beaker tests.

We need to keep an eye out if we see any
similar bugs in the future now that updates
are now executed for all packages in beaker
tests.

The Ubuntu packages for panko-api now defaults
to installing with Apache and WSGI so it drops
the vhost files in the directory which the apache
module then removes.

We force them as empty and by that we keep idempotency
but we also dont break package upgrades for panko-api
because the dh-apache helper for deb packging fails if
these files are removed.

This is the same as we've done for keystone, sahara etc.

Previously there was no logging of the ansible run which invokes
tripleo-modify-image when the run was successful. Also when the run
failed, the printing of ProcessExecutionError results in no separation
of newlines, so it was hard to read.

This commit makes the following changes:
- log at info instead of debug, since that is the logging level of
  scripts/tripleo-container-image-prepare
- set playbook verbosity to -vvv, default of -vvvvv is too much
- for a successful play, log the contents of the resulting ansible.log
- for a failed play, log the ansible output and point the user at
  the working directory so they have the option of running the playbook
  manually

While executing functional tests in trove project, with baseptyhon
python3 in change [1], there appears few incompatibilities
in troveclient.

All of them are directly related to differences in PY3 version.

This change removes these issues and will allow to execute functional
tests seamlessly.

Change details:
  * troveclient/compat/base.py - dict.iteritems was removed in PY3
    because dict.items now does the thing dict.iteritems did in PY2
  * troveclient/compat/client.py - json.loads expects string, and

The current implementation of task validation wraps all exceptions with
InvalidTaskException class. There are bunch of expected errors which
produce user-friendly errors and there is no reason to wrap them. Also,
since they are raised in expected places, printing traceback of such
exceptions even in debug mode is redundant.
As for unexpected errors, they can happen only while developing new
features or modifying existing ones. Wrapping them by
InvalidTaskException hiddes traceback by default and it is hard to
identify the real root cause. Let's remove usage of InvalidTaskException
at validation step to provide more clear messages.

The patch does a few things to clean up our job management:

- Refactor all jobs into project-templates in order to very
  clearly identify which jobs are voting and non-voting.
- Drop all `voting: false` stanza in jobs, the infrastructure
  team suggests that we place those in job assignment, not
  in definition.
- Set CentOS 7 job to voting for metal, as it is finally passing
  now.

We should disable this as:
a) this is unwanted
b) we want to use only plugins shipped with rpm
c) we do not use those two plugins anyway

We do this by simply overriding the ""rabbitmq_install_plugins"" to a
comment.

RO / RW caveats (the secondary RW attachment issue) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ By default, secondary volume attachments are made in read/write mode which can be problematic, especially for operations like volume migration. TODO: what else? Backend support ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Which volume and virt backends support multiattach? Is there a feature support matrix for volume backends that we can link to? How does one discover this (I guess the end user gets it from the volume type)? Does the storage backend capabilities API expose this to admins? You can link to the nova feature support matrix for this: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/support-matrix.html#operation_multiattach_volume Compute API caveats ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Maybe this goes in nova? - minimum required microversion (2.60); link to the REST API history doc - boot from volume and normal attach are supported - volume attach to a shelved offloaded instance is not supported - the compute hosting the instance must be new enough to support multiattach Policy rules ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Describe the various policy rules for volume multiattach in Cinder. Known issues ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - retype with a multiattach volume is not supported (this is in the cinder api reference already); however, there is no api-ref for volume migration which is the admin-level operation but does a swap volume underneath. - libvirt/qemu version restrictions; libvirt>=3.10 or qemu<2.10.

On hosts with dvr_snat agent mode, after restarting OVS agent,
sometimes the SNAT port is processed first instead of the distributed port.
The subnet_info is cached locally via get_subnet_for_dvr when either of these ports
are processed. However, it returns the MAC address of the port used to query
as the gateway for the subnet. Using the SNAT port, this puts the wrong
MAC as the gateway, causing some flows such as the DVR flows on br-int
for local src VMs to have the wrong MAC.

This patch fixes the get_subnet_for_dvr with fixed_ips as None for the csnat port,
as that causes the server side handler to fill in the subnet's actual gateway
rather than using the port's MAC.

Because this patch is generated by a script, there may be some

The Ubuntu packages for panko-api now defaults
to installing with Apache and WSGI so it drops
the vhost files in the directory which the apache
module then removes.

We force them as empty and by that we keep idempotency
but we also dont break package upgrades for panko-api
because the dh-apache helper for deb packging fails if
these files are removed.
