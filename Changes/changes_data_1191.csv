Configuring SSL in Apache HTTPd is more complicated than the
instructions indicate. First, there's multiple mods for SSL and these
docs only mention mod_nss, where some deployers will find mod_ssl
the better option. Second, it doesn't say how to set up a server
certificate so they'll be using a self-signed certificate which is
useless.

Since this doc is only useful to an inexperienced deployers, and an
inexperienced deployer will be confused by these instructions, we're
better off not documenting it. Deployers should be reading the
excellent Apache docs for how to set up SSL.

Murano doesn't support cirros images since 6.1 release.
and will not support it in the future.

So adding murano data was removed from the base class
DeploymentMultinodeSerializer and added to the serializers,
belongs to the previous releases.

The same thing applies to DeploymentHASerializers.

Corresponding tests were updated.

If evaluation returns *predeploy error* data (i.e., enforcement failed), then deployment of Murano environment fails. *Predeploy* policy rules are represented by *predeploy_error(env_id, obj_id, message)* congress table. It means * Congress administrator is responsible for creating predeploy rules, which has this table on the left side (see examples). * Murano is not involved in policy rule evaluation, except that Murano provides data about Murano environments. Thus user can use any data (e.g., datasource tables, policy rules) available in Congress to define when environment can be deployed. Table *predeploy_error(env_id, obj_id, message)* reports list of found errors: * *env_id* environment id where error was detected * *obj_id* object id (in environment id) on which error was detected * *message* text message of error Murano environment serialization/decomposition is described in `Congress Support in Murano <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/murano/+spec/congress-support-in-murano>`_ and `Murano Congress Driver <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/congress/+spec/murano-driver>`_ Example (generic): :: predeploy_error(env_id, obj_id, message) :- murano:state(env_id,""PENDING""), my-rule-table1(env_id, obj_id), concat("""", ""some error message 1"", message) predeploy_error(env_id, obj_id, message) :- murano:state(env_id,""PENDING""), my-rule-table2(env_id, obj_id), concat("""", ""some error message 2"", message) my-rule-table1(env_id, obj_id) :- .... my-rule-table2(env_id, obj_id) :- .... Example (allow only environments where all VM instances has flavor with max 2048MB RAM): :: predeploy_error(eid, oid, msg) :- murano:object(oid, eid, type), checkIfError(oid), concat("""", ""Instance flavor has RAM size over 2048MB"", msg) checkIfError(oid) :- murano:parent_type(oid, ""io.murano.resources.Instance""), murano:property(oid, ""flavor"", fname), nova:flavors(i,fname,v,r,d,e,rx), gt(r,2048) Enforcement point will use Congress simulation api to evaluate rules on passed mapped environment into Congress schema.

When ProcessLauncher is initialized, among else it setups handlers
for termination signals (SIGHUP, SIGTERM and SIGINT). It is known
that only one signal handler can be installed per signal and only
the latest installed handler will be active.
So, if several ProcessLauncher instances are being initialized
in the same process then only handlers of the last instance
will be triggered on receiving a signal.

This change adds a class attribute set to store all handlers and
redefines handle_signal so that it calls all handlers one by one
when a signal is received.

ip_lib was parsing tunnel links incorrectly. We can create interface
names with any character the filesystem supports (not '..', '/', ':').
Given this we do not know what to delimit on so parsing iproute2 output
is probably not a good idea.

I asked the iproute2 devs what the proper way we should get interface
names is and was told NOT to parse iproute2 output but to use something
like sysfs instead.  http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg316577.html

This patch pulls interfaces from sysfs (/sys/class/net) and verifies them
via checking if they are links (bonding creates files for instance and
needs to be skipped).

Currently it is not possible without jumping through a ton of hoops to
access a network namespace without iproute2 or cython, so we use ip to
run find to find the correct sysfs directory.  We also only call out to
iproute2 _ONLY_ if needed.

Currently, there are several filesystem-based drivers in Cinder, such as
nfs, glusterfs, smbfs, etc. Multiple formats of volume other than ""raw"" can be
potentially supported in these drivers, such as qcow2, raw, vhd, etc.

This work aims to handle these files of various formats safely and

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================= Add support to store volume format info in Cinder ================================================= Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/add-support-store-volume-format-info Problem description =================== Currently, there are several filesystem-based drivers in Cinder, such as nfs, glusterfs, etc. Multiple formats of volume other than ""raw"" can be potentially supported in these drivers, such as qcow2, raw, sparse, etc. However, Cinder does not store the actual format of volume and supposes all volumes are ""raw"" format. It will has or already has several problems as follows: * For volume migration, the generic migration implementation in Cinder uses the ""dd"" command to copy ""src"" volume to ""dest"" volume. If the src volume is ""qcow2"" format, instance will not get the right data from volume after the dest volume attached to instance, because the info returned from Cinder states that the volume's format is ""raw"" other than ""qcow2"" * For volume backup, the backup driver also supposes that src volumes are ""raw"" format, other format will not be supported Proposed change =============== The ""format"" info should be added to ""admin_metadata"" of volumes, and enforce it on all operations, such as create, copy, migrate and retype. The ""format"" will be only set / updated for filesystem-based drivers, other drivers will not contains this metadata and have a default ""raw"" format. Alternatives ------------ Indeed, glusterfs driver has used ""qemu-img info"" command to judge the format of volume. However, this auto detection method has many possible error / exploit vectors. Because if the beginning content of a ""raw"" volume happens to a ""qcow2"" disk, auto detection method will judge this volume to be a ""qcow2"" volume wrongly. Data model impact ----------------- For volumes on filesystem-based driver, there will be a related record in volume_admin_metadata table. For this record, the key column is ""format"" and the value is the volume's format in volume_admin_metadata table. REST API impact --------------- The ""format"" info will returned within ""metadata"" in volume show API:: /v1/{tenant_id}/volumes/{volume_id} /v2/{tenant_id}/volumes/{volume_id} { ""volume"": { ""status"": ""available"", ... ""metadata"": { ""format"": ""raw"", ... } } } Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: <zhangleiqiang> Work Items ---------- To support this feature, the work items are: * Return ""format"" info within ""admin_metadata"" key in create_volume method of remotefs driver, then the driver can store the format info into db * Add ""format"" info within ""data"" key in return value of method cinder.volume.manager.VolumeManager:initialize_connection * Set ""format"" as visible admin metadata in show API (v1 and v2) and return ""format"" info within ""metadata"" in its response body * Update the dest volume's ""format"" info after migrating the volume.

This commit adds the logic in the HostManager class for processing calls
that include updated instance information about hosts to the scheduler.
Subsequent commits will add the RPC calls.

DocImpact
We add a new CONF option 'scheduler_tracks_instance_changes'. This
option is a boolean option that defaults to True. This option controls
whether or not the scheduler is responsible for tracking changes to
instances on compute nodes. If True, compute nodes notify the scheduler
when instances are updated, created, and deleted. This allows the
scheduler to keep its in-memory representation of usage and instance
location accurate. However, the current implementation of instance
tracking functionality in the scheduler *may* be too resource-intensive,
and thus this option enables deployers that do not either use scheduler
filters that rely on instance information or are concerned about
performance of the scheduler to disable this functionality.

If enforcement fails, then deployment fails. Proposed change =============== When user executes *deploy* action on an environment, we have to identify attached policy rules and call Congress (see Congress Support in Murano, and Policy Rules Attachement in Murano). Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Versioning impact ------------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Deployer impact --------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Murano-dashboard / Horizon impact --------------------------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- **TBD** Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: <launchpad-id or None> Other contributors: <launchpad-id or None> Work Items ---------- 1. Use implementation of *Congress Support in Murano*, and *Policy Rules Attachement in Murano* in order to implement policy enforcement point as adviced by Stan: Stan: such approach makes PolicyEnforces (and thus dependency on Congess) be mandatory for Murano. Better approach for now coud be just insert at https://github.com/stackforge/murano/blob/master/murano/common/engine.py#L112 something like if config.CONF.enable_policy_enforcer: policyenforcer.validate(self.model) Dependencies ============ *Congress Support in Murano*, and *Policy Rules Attachement in Murano* Testing ======= **TBD** Please discuss how the change will be tested. We especially want to know what tempest tests will be added. It is assumed that unit test coverage will be added so that doesn't need to be mentioned explicitly, but discussion of why you think unit tests are sufficient and we don't need to add more tempest tests would need to be included. Is this untestable in gate given current limitations (specific hardware / software configurations available)? Is this untestable in murano-ci? If so, are there mitigation plans (3rd party testing, gate enhancements, etc). Documentation Impact ==================== **TBD** What is the impact on the docs team of this change? Some changes might require donating resources to the docs team to have the documentation updated. Don't repeat details discussed above, but please reference them here.

It was introduced with the Havana release. Docker is an open-source engine which automates the deployment of applications as highly portable,self-sufficient containers which are independent of hardware, language, framework, packaging system and hosting provider. Refer [OPENSTACK_DOCKER_DOCUMENTATION]_. This new change proposed will enable deployment and configuration of nova-docker driver, glance repo configuration and any needed config to support seemless managment of docker nodes in openstack cloud. Problem description =================== * Currently, there is no Chef cookbook support to configure OpenStack nova and glance services to support nova-docker driver [OPENSTACK_DOCKER_COOKBOOK_OLD]_ is an available option which is not maintained for last 2 years and it has embedded 2 years old driver. * There is no Chef cookbook support to configure ceilometer to monitor Docker containers in an openstack echo system. This will be supported in the second version of the cookbook Proposed change =============== Add a cookbook included recipes and related attributes/unit tests to configure Openstack services such as nova and glance to use nova-docker driver. Also include recipes that can configure cadvisor to support ceilometer montoring on Docker containers. This cookbook will configure * [NOVA_DOCKER_DRIVER]_ . We will soon support binary installation of nova docker driver as well We will also need to introduce a new role os-docker-compute-single-controller which will have all the docker recipes in the order explained in the blueprint.

Dependencies ============ * In order to configure nova-docker driver - compute nodes should be pre installed with docker runtime. Users can opt to use cookbook [CHEF_DOCKER]_ In case above cookbook does not support the OS where compute is getting configured use doucmentation which is available at [DOCKER_RUNTIME_INSTALLATION]_. * openstack-docker supports RHEL7 and Ubuntu * This depends on Nova Docker driver [NOVA_DOCKER_DRIVER]_. Current design takes latest git source and integrates it with openstack services. If no internet access is available , user can also opt it to clone the git source as a local .zip file and use it Testing ======= * Add unit tests for the recipes. * For function and CI integration test, at least one node with OpenStack all-in-one deployment is recommended.

At this moment only Openvswitch part made as provider based. I propose refactor this module for achive following aims: * unify, and make provider-agnostic configuration options for all network resources (not only Openvswitch) * make l23network resources pluggable by provider-based puppet way. As demo, we can made Contrail or OpenDaylight plugin. * improve possibility of combine different provider to the one composite network scheme. Proposed change =============== L2::Bridge ---------- L2::Port -------- L2::Bond -------- It's a special type of port. Designed for bonding two or more interfaces. L2::Patch --------- It's a special type of port. Designed for connect bridges inside one physical host to one L2 virtual network segment. .. code-block:: puppet l23network::l2::patch { 'br1-to-br2': bridges => ['br1', 'br2'], ports => ['br1-xxx1', 'br2-xxx2'], # patchcord jack's names vlan_ids => [0,0], # vlan IDs for each jack provider => lnx # (or ovs) } For OVS provider this resource will be implemented as native ""patch"" interface type. For LNX -- as veth pair, where interfaces inserted to corresponded bridges as tagged or not ports. L2::Tunnel ---------- It's a special type of port. Designed for connect bridges on different nodes to one L2 virtual network segment. It looks like L2::Patch resource. .. code-block:: puppet l23network::l2::tunnel { 'tun-to-node2': peer => ""....."", bridge => 'br1', port => 'br1-xxx1', vlan_ids => 0, type => gre, # (or vxlan) provider => lnx } Will be supported following types of TUNs: * Point-to-point GRE TUN * Point-to-point VXLAN TUN * Multicast group based VXLAN L3::Ifconfig ------------ Alternatives ------------ Leave it as-is. This will limit our ability to deploy configure some specific vendor-based solutions, that incompotible with open vSwitsh.

Also will be better implement test cases for periodically run ones on bare-metal lab. Documentation Impact ==================== Current documentation will has not lage changes, because network_scheme interface shouldn't be changed. But this refactoring give us pluggability.

Previous to the introduction of a formal IPAM interface, the scope was implicit. It was assumed that each tenant owned its own IPv4 address scope. NAT is needed when routing across address scopes if allowed at all (e.g. allowed between tenants and ""external networks"" and not allowed between tenants). With IPv4, overlapping addresses is needed. With IPv6, we'd like to avoid overlap, even between scopes. However, scopes are still useful for routing. For example, if you are a tenant in a shared datacenter, the admin should set up an address scope from which addresses/subnets can be allocated in order to be routable on an ""external network."" Incidentally, I don't think that Neutron should enforce uniqueness of addresses for IPv6 like in the case of ULA. However, proper methods (from RFCs) should be used to generate ULA addresses to avoid conflict. An address scope has a range of addresses which are available for allocation. The implicit tenant IPv4 address scopes should include *all* possible addresses. The IPv6 implicit scope might be a little more limiting (e.g. ULA addresses, global unicast, etc) but maybe not.

Note: Requires Docker 1.2 or greater.

This change removes the need for dhcrelay
for cobbler container and the configuration
of masquerade ip forward rules. It will be
left installed in case of rollback to a
previous Fuel release.

Changes LXC driver to native exec driver
libcontainer. shell command now uses docker
exec command instead of lxc-attach.

Added privileged mode to nailgun container which
is necessary for sysctl to operate with host
networking mode.

Removed link from nailgun to mcollective because
it is not needed any longer.

It is more suitable for libraries than for the major projects, because it includes a list of all of the changes and diff-stats output to show which files changed. The script parses the README.rst to find a line matching ""``Bugs:``"", extracts the URL following the colon, and includes that information in the output. The bugs URL is converted to a launchpad project URL and combined with the final version number to produce a *milestone* URL. The script uses ``python setup.py`` to determine the project name and the one-line description to include in the output text.

Heat can now run in standalone mode with the default v3 keystone
backend.

This change removes the installation of the v2 contrib backend.
It also configures saner defaults when HEAT_STANDALONE is True.
Using trusts and a stack-domain will never work in standalone mode
since they both require a service user which doesn't exist in
standalone mode.

Finally, this change prevents heat.conf being populated with service user options
not required by standalone mode.

Configuring the v2 backend may be reintroduced later with a dedicated
flag variable.

Addition of the Magnum Project - a collaboration of 24 engineers
from 13 affiliations to bring containers to Openstack as a first
class resource. We just concluded our Midcycle meetup.

Magnum builds on Heat to produce Nova instances on which to run
application containers. It is licensed under Apache 2.0, and all
contributors have signed an OpenStack CLA.

All library dependencies allow for unrestricted distribution and
deployment. Our PTL is chosen by our contributors, and holds
weekly IRC meetings in #openstack-meeting-alt and are logged using
Meetbot. We are also available in #openstack-containers to for
daily discussion and as a way for users to converse with our
developers openly.

All Magnum source code is posted to Gerrit, and reviewed. We allow
code merge after two +2 votes. Our code is automatically unit
tested by the OpenStack CI infrastructure. Our PTL serves as a
contact for cross-project teams in OpenStack.

We make extensive use of existing software, and have not
deliberately reproduced functionality that already exists in other
ecosystem projects. Magnum doesn't compete with Swarm, Docker, or
Kubernetes, but instead offers a user experience that integrates
those systems for use with OpenStack. We are open to integrating
best-of-breed technologies that help OpenStack operators offer
application containers to their cloud users.

We have implemented Magnum using the oslo common libraries and
the Pecan+WSME WSGI framework. Magnum completely conforms to the
OpenStack development style.

Project direction has been publically discussed at the Oregon
Nova Midcycle, the Paris OpenStack Design Summit, and in March
2015 at the Magnum Midcycle in San Francisco.

We use the openstack-dev ML for project discussion and do not use
any other mailing lists.

Magnum is compatible with OpenStack APIs, and uses Keystone
middleware to integrate with OpenStack Identity. All per-tenant
Magnum infrastructure is deployed using OpenStack Orchestration
using HOT files.

There are numerous active contributors from several affiliations
who have allocated full-time engineers to contribute to Magnum.

Magnum is different from Nova, because it provides a purpose built
API to manage application containers, which have a distinctly
different lifecycle and operations than Nova (machine) Instances.

Magnum is also different from Docker and Kubernetes, by offering
an asynchronous REST API that's compatible with Keystone, and a
complete multi-tenancy implementation. It does not perform
orchestration internally, and instead relies on OpenStack
Orchestration.

Setting the local device filter like we were doing here
doesn't actually solve the problem.  We actually need to
set a global filter.

Submitted change: I5d5c48e188cbb9b4208096736807f082bce524e8

Once that lands this code won't be necessary at all and should
be removed.  We'll also remove the local conf usage in Cinder,
but currently that's harmless as it's designed to detect if
the local lvm.conf file exists in the cinder directory and
behave appropriately based on it's existence.

Namespaces provide a level of direction to specific identifiers and make it possible to differentiate between identifiers with the same exact name. With network namespaces, you can have different and separate instances of network interfaces and routing tables that operate separate from each other. Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Virtual routing and forwarding is an IP technology that allows multiple instances of a routing table to coexist on the same router at the same time.

Currently the output of run-playbooks is filtered through an awk
statement to reduce the verbosity of the output. The problem is that
bash uses the return code from the right most command to determine the
return code for the whole pipe. Awk successfully processes the
run-playbooks output, even if run-playbooks fails, so awk returns 0, and
the pipeline is assumed to have completed successfully.

From the bash manual:

""Each command in a pipeline is executed in its own subshell (see Command
Execution Environment). The exit status of a pipeline is the exit status
of the last command in the pipeline, unless the pipefail option is
enabled (see The Set Builtin). If pipefail is enabled, the pipeline’s
return status is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with
a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully. If the
reserved word ‘!’ precedes the pipeline, the exit status is the logical
negation of the exit status as described above. The shell waits for all
commands in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.""

By enabling pipefail, we can ensure that the pipeline exits non-zero if
the run-playbooks script fails.

When we moved parameters from the stack table to the template table
we did it in a ""flexible"" way, but this led to some difficult to
diagnose problems. So this patch totally removes ""env"" as an argument
to the Stack class to make absolutely sure that we are doing this

- env was not getting passed into instance group make_templates()
- template deepcopy was not working correctly (causing some problems

Prior to this change, the generated YAML would insert the vlan interface
underneath (textually) the Addresses list, indented in a way that ends
up inserting it (data-structurally) as a member of the addresses list
rather than as a member of the interfaces list.

I *think* this change puts it in the expected place.

But current code in l3-agent will continue continue

Use the standard session and auth plugin helpers from keystoneclient to
standardize the options available for talking to neutron. This will
allow improvements such as using keystone v3 authentication for the
neutron user.

DocImpact: Deprecating the existing auth parameters in favour of
keystoneclient's session and auth plugin loading parameters.

Currently, several of the volumes apis depend on callers to pass
service_type='volume' as a parameter when creating a client object,
to route correctly. The problem is, it makes it impossible for
callers to work with both the compute and volume endpoints at the
same time. They can either work with compute and have volumes.* calls
return 404, or they can work with volume and have servers.* images.*
flavors.* calls return 404.

The CLI sets service_type='volume' for client objects for the
following commands via a decorator:

volume-list
volume-show
volume-create
volume-delete
volume-snapshot-list
volume-snapshot-show
volume-snapshot-create
volume-snapshot-delete
volume-type-list
volume-type-create
volume-type-delete

With this change, the service_type 'volume' is set in the api,
so the decorators on the shell commands are no longer needed.

Here we give a couple of problems encountered in production deployments along with tips for solving them. 1. Log file too big **Symptom**: slower than normal performance, log size not changing **Solution**: set up logrotate (a Linux service). In the directory `/etc/logrotate.d`, include a file `congress` and add an entry such as the one shown below.

The basic Auth plugin for v3 tokens makes the assumption that you need
to pass in some AuthMethod objects. This works well for most auth types
where you want the plugin to construct the auth request for you.

In the case of federation though we want to be able to have a rescoping
plugin that will return an auth_ref and not take any auth_methods as
arguments.

Extract the most basic part of the Auth plugin into BaseAuth class that

These test for appopriate HTTP behavior. Two different files are
used: one without any resources established by fixture and one which
uses the SampleDataFixture to make sure there is one resource.

Future gabbi tests for resources should explore authorization

The main integration path is via docker-compose using fig YML files. Each container set has a common YML and associated openstack.env. The openstack.env file describes the command line environment to pass to the docker-compose yml files. ## Why integate with Kolla? Integrating with Kolla takes a hard part of managing an OpenStack system, specifically managing the container images, and places the burden on a third party project. We strive to do an excellent job of providing world-class OpenStack containers atleast as a reference architecture, and possibly as what may be desireable to deploy into live production. ## Docker Command Line Arguments Every container set YML file includes the necessary docker CLI operations needed to launch the container in a tidy YML file. Instead of guessing which set of command line operations are needed per container, the docker-compose YML file can be used directly and will pass the appropriate command line values to the container on container start. The parameterized docker features used by kolla are: * --pid=host * --net=host * -v host:container * --privileged These parameterized features are not exposed to the user. Instead they are executed via docker-compose. ## Environment Variables Not all containers require all environment variables. Rather the document which containers need which environment variables, we expect the orchestration layer to pass *all* environment variables to every container it instantiates via fig. This allows a nice simple method of ensuring every type of node (controller, storage, compute) recieves the same configuration. ### Environment Variable KEY/VALUE pairs ADMIN_TENANT_NAME=<admin> - tenant name DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=<mysql root password> - defines the MYSQL root password FLAT_INTERFACE=<nova or neutron networking flat interface device name> GLANCE_API_SERVICE_HOST=<IP> - address where glance API is running> GLANCE_DB_NAME=<glance> - DB name of glance service GLANCE_DB_PASSWORD=<password> - <Glance DB password> GLANCE_DB_USER=<glance> - User name of glance in the database GLANCE_KEYSTONE_PASSWORD=<password> - Keystone DB password GLANCE_KEYSTONE_USER=<keystone> - Glance Keystone User GLANCE_REGISTRY_SERVICE_HOST=<glance IP> Glance registry service host KEYSTONE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password> KEYSTONE_ADMIN_SERVICE_HOST=<IP> - IP Address of Keystone Host KEYSTONE_ADMIN_SERVICE_PORT=<5000> - Port where Keystone operates KEYSTONE_ADMIN_TOKEN=<keystone-secret> - A token used to access Keystone KEYSTONE_AUTH_PROTOCOL=<http> - The keystone authentication protocol KEYSTONE_DB_PASSWORD=<password> - The password used to access Keystone in the DB KEYSTONE_PUBLIC_SERVICE_HOST=<IP> - The IP address where Keystone is running MARIADB_SERVICE_HOST=<IP> - The IP Address where mariadb is running MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<password> - The MYSQL password NETWORK_MANAGER=<nova|neutron> - Use Nova or Neutron networking NOVA_API_SERVICE_HOST=<IP> - The IP Address where the Nova API Service is hosted NOVA_DB_NAME=<nova> - The name of the nova entry in the database NOVA_DB_PASSWORD=<password> - The password used to access nova NOVA_DB_USER=<nova> - The name of the nova DB password NOVA_EC2_API_SERVICE_HOST=<IP> - The IP Address where the Nova EC2 API is hosted arn't these two the same? NOVA_EC2_SERVICE_HOST=<IP> _ The IP Address wher ethe Nova EC2 service is hosted NOVA_KEYSTONE_PASSWORD=<password> - The Nova keystone password NOVA_KEYSTONE_USER=<nova> - The Nova keystone username PUBLIC_INTERFACE=<eth1> - The nova public interface PUBLIC_IP=<Host IP Address> - The IP Address of this host RABBITMQ_PASS=<rabbit> - The rabbitmq password used to join AMQP RABBITMQ_SERVICE_HOST=<IP> - The IP Address where the Rabbit service is running RABBITMQ_USER=<rabbit> - The RabbitMQ user name RABBIT_PASSWORD=<password> - The RabbitMQ password RABBIT_USERID=<rabbit> - The RabbitMQ user id on the host ## Launching a container set Pick out a simple container set and launch it as follows: docker-compose -f compose/rabbitmq.yml up -d The third party deployment engine should launch the apprpriate containers for the appropriate nodes. Note the rabbitmq.yml used in the example above expects an openstack.env file present in the current working directory. This file will be passed as environment data to the container and configure the container appropriately. # Conclusion Integrating with Kolla is as sample as creating a openstack.env file, having a deployment tool write the openstack.env file and .yml files to the nodes are targeted for deployment, and running docker-compose as described in the above documentation.

Updates to secrets functional tests to make them more readable
and understandable:

-- make copies of default data to avoid corruption when tests
are run in parallel

-- rename tests to be more descriptive

-- changed test model fields to direct assignments rather than
using override_values.

-- using explicit keyword args for ""old way"" secret payload GETs.

Added ACL based policy support for a secret or container 'read' operation.
Added support for allowing secret and container's creator to perform 'get'
call.
Added unit tests for policy changes.

Changed logic around secret or container project to match token's project.
Now it uses policy rule instead of using it in db lookup critieria.

They're here only as hints or reminders. If you are unsure # consult the online docs. You have been warned. # # The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections: # 1. Directives that control the operation of the Apache server process as a # whole (the 'global environment'). # 2. Directives that define the parameters of the 'main' or 'default' server, # which responds to requests that aren't handled by a virtual host. # These directives also provide default values for the settings # of all virtual hosts. # 3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to # different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the # same Apache server process. # # Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many # of the server's control files begin with ""/"" (or ""drive:/"" for Win32), the # server will use that explicit path. If the filenames do *not* begin # with ""/"", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so ""logs/foo.log"" # with ServerRoot set to ""/etc/httpd"" will be interpreted by the # server as ""/etc/httpd/logs/foo.log"". # ### Section 1: Global Environment # # The directives in this section affect the overall operation of Apache, # such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where it # can find its configuration files. # # # Don't give away too much information about all the subcomponents # we are running. Comment out this line if you don't mind remote sites # finding out what major optional modules you are running ServerTokens OS # # ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's # configuration, error, and log files are kept. # # NOTE! If you intend to place this on an NFS (or otherwise network) # mounted filesystem then please read the LockFile documentation # (available at <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mpm_common.html#lockfile>); # you will save yourself a lot of trouble. # # Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path. # ServerRoot ""/etc/httpd"" # # PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process # identification number when it starts. Note the PIDFILE variable in # /etc/sysconfig/httpd must be set appropriately if this location is # changed. # PidFile run/httpd.pid # # Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out. # Timeout 60 # # KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than # one request per connection).

This address appears on some server-generated pages, such # as error documents. e.g. admin@your-domain.com # ServerAdmin root@localhost # # ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself. # This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify # it explicitly to prevent problems during startup. # # If this is not set to valid DNS name for your host, server-generated # redirections will not work.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================= Endpoint Policy Extension ========================= `bp domain-config-ext <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/domain-config-ext>`_ Extension ``OS-DOMAIN-CONFIG`` provides the means to store the configuration options that would normally stored in a domain specific configuration file in an SQL table instead. Problem Description =================== Domain specific configuration files are used to specify the unique options for a given domain with regard its identity backend (e.g. ldap url to be used for that domain). This use of a separate configuration file for each domain leads to some complexity in the choreography of on-boarding a new domain, e.g.: - Call the Keystone API to add a new domain - Use an out-of-band mechanism to create and place the domain specific configuration file on the Keystone server - Restart Keystone to ensure cause the domain specific configuration file to be read The two different mediums of where information about a domain is stored also makes it rather different to provide APIs to read all the options being used for a specific domain. Proposed Change =============== This extension will provide the ability to store the configuration options in an SQL backend, indexed by domain ID. A main configuration option will dictate whether Keystone uses this extension is used to obtain domain specific configuration data or the existing domain specific configuration files approach. It will be an all or nothing option - there will be no mixing of some options in the extension and some in configuration files. Keystone will go through the logic of building the domain configurations in the same way as it does today, either reading the configurations options from the extension or from the set files. An additional option will be supported by the extension to initiate a re-loading of the backend for a given domain (using whatever new configuration data there may be), further assisting the on-boarding of a domain. While such a re-load could perhaps be triggered by an update request to the configuration information itself for a domain, it is more likely a cloud provider might want to chose the moment the new domain configuration data is enabled. The extension can only be used to replace options that would have appeared in a domain specific file - it will not allow options to be specified that would normally appear in the main Keystone configuration file. Alternatives ------------ None Data Model Impact ----------------- Changes to the data model will be restricted to a new tables for storing the configuration information in the extension repo. REST API Impact --------------- The exact API specification will be defined as part of a review of an changes to the Identity API. This will include: - API to provide CRUD operations for the configuration data - API re-loading a domain backend based on new configuration data. Security Impact --------------- This extension exposes a new API to the backend configuration data for a domain. Like any other v3 API, it will be subject to the standard RBAC permissions model. Notifications Impact -------------------- None, other than the extension will subscribe to domain deletion events. Other End User Impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- None Developer Impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: henry-nash Work Items ---------- - Get agreement of API specifications - Implement the domain configuration code - Implement the domain re-loading code Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= None Documentation Impact ==================== Changes to the Identity API and configuration.rst.

Projects in ""coordinated release"" mode are projects which follow the ""common release"" model and are directly managed by the Release Management team. Rationale ========= This tag communicates the release model followed by a given piece of OpenStack code. This is useful information for a lot of downstream stakeholders, in particular distributions. OpenStack is built around a common 6-month release cycle. Some OpenStack software follows that cycle, some other release with a slightly different scheme. This objective tag describes what to expect. The ""release:coordinated"" tag applies to projects following the common release cycle (6-month time-based releases with 3 intermediary development milestones) and which have their release process handled directly by the release management team. They are therefore more likely to hit the precise release date deadline. The main difference with ""release:common"" projects is that ""release:coordinated"" projects submit to release management team oversight starting with Feature Freeze. They follow the processes and deadlines defined by the release management team to reduce risk of accidentally missing the final release date. Requirements ============ * ""release:coordinated"" projects stricly follow the common release cycle * ""release:coordinated"" projects accept to submit to release management team oversight starting at Feature Freeze and up to final release. * The release management team needs to accept to handle release process for those projects. The team has a limited bandwidth and reserves the right to focus on foundational projects that benefit the most from being released precisely at the same date. Projects that follow the common release cycle but handle release process by themselves (with tools and guidance from the release management team) will be tagged ""release:common"" instead. Tag application process ======================= The release management team (ultimately represented by the release management PTL) is responsible for maintaining tags in the ""release"" category, so that they match the current release model followed by each code repository. There is no need to apply for addition/removal. Changes externally proposed will be reviewed and approved by the release management team, ultimately represented by the release management PTL. Deprecation =========== Tags in the ""release"" category describe the current release model. There is no deprecation involved when those tags are updated. Attributes ========== Tags in the ""release"" category do not use attributes. Application to current projects =============================== The ""release:coordinated"" tag applies to all ""integrated-release"" projects except openstack/swift (which follows a ""release:compatible"" model).

Applications should be able to extend the default log levels since
an application typically just wants to add the libraries that it
uses beyond what the other applications use.

However, due to the nature of the migrations and the data mangling (often times hard to reverse) it is typically inadvisable to perform a downwards migration in any environment. Problem description =================== Best practices say that anytime a revert needs to happen post schema migration, it is far better to restore to a “known” working state of the database instead of trying to reverse the migrations. In many cases the migrations do significant manipulation of the data and reversing this could cause data to end up in an inconsistent or worse broken state. Often the cases a downgrade would be warranted it would be unsafe to do so (such as a failed forward migration). Proposed change =============== The proposed change is as follows: * Eliminate the downgrade option(s) from the CLI tools that are utilized for schema migrations * Document accepted best practices on handling restoring to a previous schema version. * Stop supporting / adding migrations with downgrade functions across all projects. This has the added benefit of reducing test complexity as migration tests no longer need to test the downgrade functions. Alternatives ------------ We can continue to add downgrade paths for the SQL Schema. Based upon the conversations had on the mailing list, there is no use-case for the downgrade path where a restore to a known-good-state would not be both better and the chosen path. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Morgan Fainberg (irc: morganfainberg) Work Items ---------- * Add Documentation indicating best practices going forward is to restore. * Work with oslo.db team to report appropriate errors on downgrade attempts. * (all core teams) No longer add migrations with downgrade functions.

As a part of policy guided fulfillment we need to
enforce policy rules from global context on Murano
environment deployment. If enforcement fails,
then deployment fails.

Incorporating changes based on moving murano data schema spec into
Congress specs.

If evaluation returns *predeploy error* data (i.e., enforcement failed), then deployment of Murano environment fails. *Predeploy* policy rules are represented by *predeploy_error(env_id, obj_id, message)* congress table. It means * Congress administrator is responsible for creating predeploy rules, which has this table on the left side (see examples). * Murano is not involved in policy rule evaluation, except that Murano provides data about Murano environments. Thus user can use any data (e.g., datasource tables, policy rules) available in Congress to define when environment can be deployed. Table *predeploy_error(env_id, obj_id, message)* reports list of found errors: * *env_id* environment id where error was detected * *obj_id* object id (in environment id) on which error was detected * *message* text message of error Murano environment serialization/decomposition is described in `Congress Support in Murano <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/murano/+spec/congress-support-in-murano>`_ and `Murano Congress Driver <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/congress/+spec/murano-driver>`_ Example (generic): :: predeploy_error(env_id, obj_id, message) :- murano:state(env_id,""PENDING""), my-rule-table1(env_id, obj_id), concat("""", ""some error message 1"", message) predeploy_error(env_id, obj_id, message) :- murano:state(env_id,""PENDING""), my-rule-table2(env_id, obj_id), concat("""", ""some error message 2"", message) my-rule-table1(env_id, obj_id) :- .... my-rule-table2(env_id, obj_id) :- .... Example (allow only environments where all VM instances has flavor with max 2048MB RAM): :: predeploy_error(eid, oid, msg) :- murano:object(oid, eid, type), checkIfError(oid), concat("""", ""Instance flavor has RAM size over 2048MB"", msg) checkIfError(oid) :- murano:parent_type(oid, ""io.murano.resources.Instance""), murano:property(oid, ""flavor"", fname), nova:flavors(i,fname,v,r,d,e,rx), gt(r,2048) Enforcement point will use Congress simulation api to evaluate rules on passed mapped environment into Congress schema. Proposed change =============== When user executes *deploy* action on an environment following steps will be done * environment will be mapped into *update sequence* * Congress simulation API will be executed: :: openstack congress policy simulate murano_system 'predeploy-error(envId, objId, message)' 'env+(1000,""myEnv"") obj+(1,1000,""VM"") prop+(100,1,""name"", ""vm1"") prop+(101,1,""image"", ""ubuntulinuximg"") obj+(2,1000,""Tomcat"") prop+(110,2,""name"", ""tomcat"") prop+(111,2,""port"", 8080) rel+(200,2,1, ""instance"") ' action * if response will contain non empty result, then deployment will fails Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Versioning impact ------------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- Environment deployment may fail due to policy validation failure.

Use implementation of *Congress Support in Murano* in order to implement policy enforcement point as advised by Stan (see below). The Congress support must correctly deal with following setups * Openstack with Congress installed * Openstack without Congress :: Stan: such approach makes PolicyEnforces (and thus dependency on Congress) be mandatory for Murano. Better approach for now could be just insert at https://github.com/stackforge/murano/blob/master/murano/common/engine.py#L112 something like if config.CONF.enable_policy_enforcer: policyenforcer.validate(self.model) 2. Provide Developer and User Documentation (see Documentation section). Dependencies ============ * *Congress Support in Murano* https://blueprints.launchpad.net/congress/+spec/murano-driver * *Murano datasource driver* in Congress https://blueprints.launchpad.net/congress/+spec/murano-driver * *Policy enforcement specification* https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/policy-congress-murano-spec Testing ======= Unit and integration tests must be done. Integration tests must cover following setups * Openstack has Congress installed * situations when Congress is running (i.e., responding) and not running (i.e., not responding) must be tested * Openstack has not Congress installed Documentation Impact ==================== Policy enforcement must be documented from following perspectives * Setup configuration (e.g., with and without congress) * Murano rules (i.e., Murano environment data decompositiion) in Murano policy * How Murano policy affects environment deployment Following Murano documentation will be affected * Murano Installation Guide Add section on Congress requirement and section on enabling policy enforcement * Murano Workflow Add section on Murano policy enforcement * Murano Article (new) Article on Murano policy rules (e.g., Murano environment decomposition to Congress) References ========== * *Congress Support in Murano* https://blueprints.launchpad.net/congress/+spec/murano-driver * *Murano datasource driver* in Congress https://blueprints.launchpad.net/congress/+spec/murano-driver * *Policy enforcement specification* https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/policy-congress-murano-spec ",,207,0

The SMBFS drivers use the image format in order to construct the
according image path, as some image formats require having the
proper extension.

The format is either retrieved using qemu-img if the image exists,
either via extra specs or config options otherwise.

The issue is that when searching for local images, the extension is
not used, falling back to extra specs, which can cause lazy load
errors or config options, which might change.

This issue occurs when vhd/x images are used. The fix consists in
simply using the possible extensions when trying to find existing

Currently, in compute api, detach_interface will delete neutron port
first then calls hypervisor driver to do detach_interface on the guest.
If the driver does detach_interface failed, in case of the driver raise
an exception.InterfaceDetachFailed or other NovaExceptions, there is no
handler for them.
Besides this is an asyn rpc call, so nova-api will not notice these
exceptions. End user will find the port has been deleted in neutron side,
but still can see this port on guest, this is inconsistent.

This patch moves delete port in neturon side after hypervisor finished
detach_interface successfully, if it catch NovaException,
gives a log warning, and keep this port in neutron.

Some disk partitions do not have associated I/O metrics.  This

Currently, nova-compute and brick support multipath for iSCSI volume
data path. It depends on response to targets discovery of the main
iSCSI portal, expecting multiple portal addresses to be contained.

However, some arrays only respond to discovery with a single portal
address, even if secondary portals are available. In this case,
the connector cannot know secondary portals and corresponding
iSCSI target IQN, so cannot establish multiple sessions for
the target(s). To enable the connector to login to secondary portals,
cinder should tell all the portal addresses and corresponding
target iqns/luns.

With this patch initialize_connection API will return connection_info
with multiple portal addresses/iqns/luns when multipath=True is
specified in the connector info. For example:

This also modify brick/iscsi/connector.py to make the parameter
recognized and to login to every target.

In addition, this adds an config option
'iscsi_secondary_ip_addresses' to specify a list of secondary
portal addresses for LVM iSCSI Driver.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================== IETF ABFAB federation ===================== `bp abfab <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/abfab>`_ As of the Icehouse release, the only federation protocol that is supported is SAML, the purpose of this specification is to enable support for IETF ABFAB as a federation protocol. Problem Description =================== An identity provider that issues and handles ABFAB requests wishes to allow its users access to an OpenStack Cloud. Currently this is not possible as the only federation protocol supported is SAML. Proposed Change =============== 1. Create a new auth plugin or module for IETF ABFAB requests. 2. Re-use the mapping engine to map any IETF ABFAB attributes that are presented, into Keystone attributes. 3. Leverage the Moonshot implementation of ABFAB for Apache to handle the ABFAB protocol requests and responses. Note: This feature should be written once the existing Federation code has been re-engineered, as to avoid unnecessary code duplication. Alternatives ------------ 1. Add an authentication plugin to Keystone that directly handles the ABFAB protocol. From the plugin we can send an ABFAB request to the IdP through the encrypted EAP tunnel, then handle the response within the plugin. This will also work as ABFAB was designed to work in this mode, but it will mean that there is much more code that needs to be supported inside Keystone. Security Impact --------------- None, providing the Apache ABFAB plugin is implemented correctly and follows the IETF specifications. Notifications Impact -------------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- ``python-keystoneclient`` would need to be enhanced to handle ABFAB requests. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- None Developer Impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: * d-w-chadwick (David Chadwick <d.w.chadwick@kent.ac.uk>) * iss-d (Ioram Sette <iss@cin.ufpe.br>) Work Items ---------- * Add an Apache ABFAB/Moonshot auth plugin to handle any necessary ABFAB specific data handling created by Apache. Dependencies ============ Relies on re-engineering federation for efficient implementation. See: `<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/104301/>`_ Documentation Impact ==================== Extensive documentation will have to be provided to describe any new configurations necessary.

Agents do not need use REST API calls anymore to notify a neutron server which maintains agent's state by collecting state reports from agents via amqp. They can report their own status by saving it in local files. So in case when a message queue has issues CRM still can response in time if something goes wrong with an agent. See the `feature description <https://mirantis.jira.com/browse/PROD-169>`_ for details about the implementation. ,,18,0

We configure memcached in a separate task so there's no need to do
the same in openstack::swift::proxy class, unless we moved swift to
the separate role.

Fix pre- post- tests for swift and memcached:
 * Add memcached process check for swift post test
 * Add testcase for memcached should not listen for public ip

Fix swift::proxy::cache parameter.

DocImpact: (Ops guide) if the memcached service was restarted, the
  keystone service must be restarted next as well.

ramdisk to find the right root device

As part of the blueprint root-device-hints Ironic will pass some to the
deploy ramdisk some hints about which disk device it should pick to be
root device (the one where the image will be deployed on).

Before the deploy ramdisk would pick the first device it finds, but as the
machine could have more than one SATA, SCSI or IDE disk controllers the
order in which their corresponding device nodes are added is arbitrary
causing devices like /dev/sda and /dev/sdb switching around on each
boot time.

Plus, as people are adding support to build RAID arrays in Ironic we need
a way to tell it to use the just created device to be the root device.

The list of hints that could be passed to the deploy ramdisk so it finds
the right disk is:

* wwn (STRING): unique storage identifier
* serial (STRING): disk serial number
* model (STRING): device identifier
* vendor (STRING): device vendor
* size (INT): The size of the disk in GB

If not hints are passed, the deploy ramdisk will continue to do what it
did before to find the disk.

In ML2 RPC keep track of which devices got an exception when
trying to get their details or setting them UP or DOWN.
If a device fails more than once, set it in error state.

This patch is part of the effort to improve the sync strategy
and the way error are handled by the OVS agent.

UT are needed, that's why WIP, I plan to add them when I get
some feedback

Currently the output of run-playbooks is filtered through an awk
statement to reduce the verbosity of the output. The problem is that
bash uses the return code from the right most command to determine the
return code for the whole pipe. Awk successfully processes the
run-playbooks output, even if run-playbooks fails, so awk returns 0, and
the pipeline is assumed to have completed successfully.

From the bash manual:

""Each command in a pipeline is executed in its own subshell (see Command
Execution Environment). The exit status of a pipeline is the exit status
of the last command in the pipeline, unless the pipefail option is
enabled (see The Set Builtin). If pipefail is enabled, the pipeline’s
return status is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with
a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully. If the
reserved word ‘!’ precedes the pipeline, the exit status is the logical
negation of the exit status as described above. The shell waits for all
commands in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.""

By enabling pipefail, we can ensure that the pipeline exits non-zero if
the run-playbooks script fails.

Currently all the magnum APIs can only be called
with resource id. This patch supports API calling
with name of the resources along with the id also.

Eg.
	magnum bay-delete bay1
This will delete a bay with name bay1.

This patch supports named based resource management
for bay resource and below is the list of APIs:
	GET /v1/bays/<name/id>
	DELETE /v1/bays/<name/id>

When using vsphere backend store, if the template is deleted in
vCenter datastore by some reason, it fails to delete the image
from glance due to the generic Exception.

The bug is fixed by catching oslo.vmware.FileNotFoundException,
and throw NotFound exception. So that the behavior of deleting
image will be identical with file system backend.

Change the DHCP notifier behavior to schedule a network
to a DHCP agent when a subnet is created rather than
waiting for the first port to be created.

This will reduce the possibility to get a VM port created
and have it send a DHCP request before the DHCP agent is
ready. Before, the network would be scheduled to an agent
as a result of the API call to create the VM port, so the
DHCP port wouldn't be created until after the VM port.
After this patch, the network will have been scheduled to
a DHCP agent before the first VM port is created.

There is still a possibility that the DHCP agent could be
responding so slowly that it doesn't create its port and
activate the dnsmasq instance before the VM sends traffic.
A proper fix will ensure that the dnsmasq instance is
truly ready to serve requests for a new port will require
significantly more code for barriers (either on the subnet
creation, port creation, or the nova boot process) are too
complex to add this late in the cycle.

This patch also eliminates the logic in the n1kv plugin that
was already doing the same thing.

For historic reasons the method called by the bash ramdisk to continue the
deployment was called _continue_deploy() (in code) but is exposed on the
API as ""pass_deploy_info"" (.../vendor_passthru/pass_deploy_info). The
vendor interface for IPA contains a method called continue_deploy()
(without the '_' prefix) and since we got the pxe_* drivers to work
with both ramdisks the name of both methods was causing some confusion,
because the only difference between them was the '_' prefix but they
are not related at all.

So this patch is now renaming the _continue_deploy() methods to
pass_deploy_info (same name it's exposed on the API) to improve the code
readibility of the vendor interface.

We configure memcached in a separate task so there's no need to do
the same in openstack::swift::proxy class, unless we moved swift to
the separate role.

Fix pre- post- tests for swift and memcached:
 * Add memcached process check for swift post test
 * Add testcase for memcached should not listen for public ip

DocImpact: (Ops guide) if the memcached service was restarted, the
  keystone service must be restarted next as well.

In this module no support for native linux bridges. Also support for native linux bonding implemented as part of Ifconfig resource, not as puppet provider for Bond resource. This blueprint proposed following changes: * implement provider for native linux bridging * implement provider for changing configuration files for Centos and Ubuntu * migrate from puppet template engine to FileMapper (l23_store_config custom type) Proposed change =============== L23network initial process -------------------------- Initial setup of L23network. Use_* and install_* parameters allow deployer to block some functionality and installing packets. It may need for highly customized configurations. .. code-block:: puppet class { 'l23network': use_ovs => true, install_ovs => true, use_lnx => true, install_brctl => true, } I propose, by default, to install all available packages and enable all base functionality. But it may be a cause for discussion. l23_store_config custom type ---------------------------- This resource implemented for changing part of config file by mappind according to given key/value mapping .. code-block:: puppet l23_store_config { ""l2_$interafce"": file => ""ifcfg-$interface"", config => { DEVICE => eth1, BRIDGE => br1, ONBOOT => yes, }, } Place of file location defined inside providerfor corresponded operation system. L2::Bridge ---------- Interface: .. code-block:: puppet l23network::l2::bridge { 'br1': ensure => present, external_ids => ""bridge-id=${name}"", provider => lnx, } Internals: Puppet definition l23network::l2::bridge contains: * call custom puppet type (l23_store_config) to change network interface configuration file. * call custom puppet type (l2_bridge) to configure bridge in runtime * make auto-require and auto-before for corresponded resources af it need. L2::Port -------- Just a port. All parameters will be specifyed later. L2::Bond -------- It's a special type of port. Designed for bonding two or more interfaces. Alternatives ------------ Leave it as-is. Upgrade open vSwitsh to latest LTS and pray.

Also will be better implement test cases for periodically run ones on bare-metal lab. Documentation Impact ==================== None References ========== * Transformations.

This patch implements strongSwan driver for VPNaaS, Initial effort
only supports strongSwan >= 5.x and implements an equivalent psk
net-to-net vpn service as openSwan driver did based on recommended
configuration.

Implements blueprint ipsec-strongswan-driver

DocImpact
a, StrongSwan and openSwan cannot be installed at the same time.
   Thus, both cannot be enabled for use. In the future when
   flavors/STF support is available, this will still constrain
   the flavors which can be used together.
b, Adding StrongswanDriver in the file /etc/neutron/vpn_agent.ini
   vpn_device_driver=neutron.services.vpn.device_drivers \
       .strongswan_ipsec.StrongSwanDriver
c, Apparmor can interfere with both creation of tunnels and
   established tunnels, because it controls access to operating
   system resources. Thus we can use below commands to remove
   apparmor definitions from the kernel.
     sudo apparmor_parser -R usr.lib.ipsec.charon
     sudo apparmor_parser -R usr.lib.ipsec.stroke
   However, what we are seeing is that even though we disable the
   profile for charon and stroke, apparmor is re-enabling them
   (at unknown times). As a result, we can directly disable them
   by the following commands:
     sudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.lib.ipsec.charon \
         /etc/apparmor.d/disable/
     sudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.lib.ipsec.stroke \
         /etc/apparmor.d/disable/
     sudo service apparmor restart
   In a word, you need to take care of your apparmor configurations.
d, Supports Ubuntu only. A separate commit will address Fedora.
e, Other steps are the same with the existing openSwan driver.

This patch is based on patchset67 of nachi's initial vpnaas
implementation, many thanks to nachi.

The deployment-create command creates a derived config
from the supplied config, then creates a deployment with
that. Supported signal transports are TEMP_URL_SIGNAL and
NO_SIGNAL (CFN_SIGNAL and HEAT_SIGNAL are not possible as
they require the deployment to be associated with a stack resource).

The transport TEMP_URL_SIGNAL requires that a swift object
(with TempURL) be created to receive the signal, so heatclient
now depends on swiftclient so that this object can be created.

This change implements the heatclient portion of
blueprint software-config-trigger.

This fix adds autocomplete=off attribute
to password input in the login form when
it turned to type=text for password revealing.
Without this attr user can use autocomplete
to access someone others password through
clicking on 'show password' icon and
double-clicking in password field after that.

Previously we missed typo in resource mapping name. It happend due to
using hardcoded name in registring new resource in environment.
Other resources in contrib use alternative approach, i.e. they register
classes using mapping function from native module.

This patch adds same approach for Gnocchi alarms. Also small refactoring
for re-using existing code in test.

This change adds config options so that operators can choose the default
transports for server software_config_transport and deployment
signal_transport. With properly set config values, templates should
have no need for setting these options at all, making templates more
portable across clouds.

The defaults currently are the cfn transports but consideration could be
made in the future to switch to swift.

Downstream deployment tools (puppet etc) would have enough information
to set the best heat.conf values, with something like the following
logic:

- if there is an object-store endpoint, set for *TEMP_URL*
- if there is no cloudformation endpoint, set for *HEAT*
- else set for *CFN*

Nova-manage recently gained the ability to manage both an 'api' and the
'main' database.  It initially used get_engine() to get a sqlalchemy
engine which had no assurance of being configured for the correct
database.  There is now a get_api_engine() method so it should use that
for 'nova-manage api_db' commands.

This means that it those commands will operate on the database
configured under CONF.api_database.connection

A while back I added an lvm.conf file with a device filter setting
to try and clean up the LVM hangs in the gate:
  (commit 0b9e76f280208b5b5ad54bb6fbc4133e63037286)

It turns out this was only part of the problem, the other problem
is that on an LVS/VGS command LVM will always poke at block devices
on the system to see if they belong to it.  There are a number of
situations in gate tests where /dev/sdX devices are created and
deleted and the result is that we hit situations where LVM tries
to open up devices to check them even if they've been removed.

This typically happens because udev hasn't updated yet, but the end
result is we have a blocking open call from LVM that takes approx
60 seconds to time out and fail.

The filter= only tells LVM to return devices from it's list that pass
the filter, but sadly it doesn't tell LVM that what it should or
shouldn't try to query via open calls. For that we need the global_filter.

This does in fact seem to eliminate our super long LVS/VGS command times
on several runs against my local setup.

This patch just adds an additional sed command to the cinder_backend lvm
setup script and makes the filter we already set global.

NOTE:
Another possible solution is to enable the lvmetad in our lvm.conf file.
This essentially tells LVM to store the device data when VG's or PV's are
added, this means we don't do the open at all which is likely a good
improvement that should be looked at.

There's some concern here though because it modifies the behavior of activate,
so I'd like to spend some time looking at that more closely and test things
out before considering using that instead of filters.

During attach to a nova instance, the backing VM
corresponding to the volume is relocated only if
the nova instance's ESX host cannot access the
backing's current datastore. The storage profile
is ignored and the volume's virtual disk might
end up in a non-compliant datastore. This patch
fixes the problem by checking storage profile
compliance of the current datastore.

The contextlib.nested call has been deprecated
in Python 2.7. This causes DeprecationWarning
messages in the unit tests.

There are also known issues with contextlib.nested
that were addressed by the native support for
multiple ""with"" variables. For instance, if the
first object is created but the second one throws
an exception, the first object's __exit__ is never
called.

Since Cinder no longer supports 2.6 we can remove
the use of these contextlib.nested calls.

Added hacking check to catch if any new instances
are added to the codebase.

Note: line continuation markers (e.g. '\') had to
be used or syntax errors were thrown. While using
parentheses is the preferred way for multiple line
statements it is not a requirement.

Update the unittests for _make_password_file to text exception handling.
Also switch to using tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() to create the

The _make_password_file function was corrected so that if an exception
occurred during the 'yield' portion, it would not catch the error and
convert it into a PasswordFileFailedToCreate exception.  The unit tests
are being updated to test this new behavior and also test for when it
should raise a PasswordFileFailedToCreate exception.

Also it was recommended to use tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() instead of
tempfile.mkstemp()

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ =================================== Provider Router and Router Port API =================================== In MidoNet, a router owned by the admin of the cloud called 'provider router' is created implicitly when the first extenal network is created in neutron. Provider router is a singleton object, and there is always only one that exists in the system, no matter how many external networks are created. The motivation behind this router is that it conforms to the most typical MidoNet virtual topology design in that there is a router sitting at the edge of the cloud providing external connectivity (through BGP or static routes), and internal connectivity among tenants through its routing table. This document describes the Neutron extension API for provider router and provider router port management. The document does NOT cover the following topics: * How routes and BGP are configured on the provider router * How ACL is applied on the provider router * How router ports are bound to physical interfaces They will be addressed in separate specs. Problem Description =================== Even though the provider router is implicitly created behind the scenes, the operator still needs to access the router to configure static and dynamic routes, ACL and to be able to create and bind its ports to physical interfaces. Currently there is no API in Neutron to provide access to the provider router and its ports. Proposed Change =============== To provide access to the provider router and its ports using Neutron API, the provider router and the ports are stored in the Neutron database, and new extension API are defined. Provider Router --------------- Neutron plugin would ensure that there is only one provider router in the system when an external network is created. A new database table called 'midonet_provider_router' is created where the singleton provider router is stored. The provider router does not get inserted into the 'routers' table in Neutron since there is no obvious benefit to doing so, and it will be trivial to change this design in the future. A new task resource PROVIDER_ROUTER is introduced to represent the provider router. Router Port ----------- Currently the only type of port that belongs in MidoNet that does not belong in Neutron is the router port on the provider router. Neutron does not expose any API to tenants to manage the ports on the tenant router, but with the provider router extension, the operators now need to manage the routers on the provider router to set up basic network configurations (routing, ACL, etc), as well as binding to a physical host. A new database table called 'midonet_router_ports' is created where the router ports that only belong to MidoNet are stored. A new task resouce type, ROUTER_PORT, is introduced to represent a port on a router. While the API does not prevent you from creating a port on tenant routers, since there are no tenant-facing API that could take advantage of these ports, the API is made available only to admins.

DB Model -------- **midonet_provider_router** As the name implies, this table only stores the singleton provider router. When the provider router is created, an entry is added to the Neutron's 'routers' table also. By treating the providing router as a regular Neutron router, it is possible to have router ports (described below) belonging to not only the provider router but also tenant routers. +-------------------+------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Name | Type | Description | +===================+============+============================================+ | id | UUID | ID of the provider router | +-------------------+------------+--------------------------------------------+ | name | String(255)| Name of the provider router | +-------------------+------------+--------------------------------------------+ | admin_state_up | Boolean | Administrative state of the router | +-------------------+------------+--------------------------------------------+ **midonet_router_ports** Since there is no concrete case to store non-router ports, the table is designed to only store router ports. Changing this design to more generic port table should be trivial if such design is demanded. +-------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------------+ | Name | Type | Description | +===================+===========+=============================================+ | id | UUID | ID of the port | +-------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------------+ | router_id | UUID | ID of the router the port belongs to | +-------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------------+ | ip_address | String(64)| IP address assigned to this port | +-------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------------+ | mac_address | String(32)| MAC address assigned to this port | +-------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------------+ Currently, due to limitation in MidoNet, only one IPv4 address can be assigend to a port. **midonet_tasks** New task data types, PROVIDER_ROUTER and ROUTER_PORT are introduced. Security -------- Only admins can create an external network, so the provider router is always owned by the admin. Tenants do not have the privilege to modify the router. Likewise, only admins can create router ports, but only because there are no tenant facing API that could take advantage of these ports.

In the left nav, only the panel group containing the panel for the current page
should be expanded. However, in the Chrome browser, all other panels in the
same dashboard are momentarily shown before being hidden. The flash of content
happens in the time between the page's template rendering the panels and the
JavaScript being run to hide the non-active panels. Prevent the flash by hiding
non-active panels in the template instead of using JavaScript to hide the
panels later.

The refactoring commit [1] moves router_info and NAT rules
code from l3-agent into vpn device driver, which cause
breakage due to the following two problems:

1, The router is maintained in the driver, and not the VPN

Originally the gate check scripts were built in such a way that they
could cater for all branches with the same script. This no longer needs
to be the case as the gate checks are acknowledged to be branch-specific.

The necessary bits to cater for the other branches have now be removed
to simplify the scripts.

Also, in master all environment variables are exported, which helps with
ensuring that the variables are present when other scripts are also run.
This is a better practise and has been included in the script clean-up.

This patch provides for an optional 'description' that can
be included in a policy config section. The value of this
description is included in the policy info returned in response
to a capabilities/info request.

The description value is limited to a maximum of 4096 characters.

NOTE: The StoragePolicy parser does not tolerate unexpected options
in the policy sections of swift.conf, which means that code must be
upgraded with this patch in every service that might load policies
before adding description options to swift.conf.

To avoid confusion, make the cache time and cache toggle for a
given subsystem configurable via the more friendly
`get_memoization_decorator`. This has the added benefit of
making the resulting decorated methods easier to read as they
are only decorated with the resulting function not needing
the decorator with the same arguments repeatedly.

This change also creates the `get_expiration_time_fn` function
that better describes the fallthrough behavior of the [cache]
expiration_time config value.

This patch updates the revocation event cache time to be in the
proper [revoke] section of the config for consistency with the
other sections.

DocImpact: revocation_cache_time moved from [token] config
section to [revoke]/cache_time
