Ceilometer logs metering data into a database by default. In some cases
it is ideal to have the metering data go into a file which can be
examined easily. This patch adds the file based publisher. One can
make changes to pipeline.yaml file to add the file publisher to
an existing pipeline or a new pipeline so that metering data can not
only be saved in database but also can be saved in a file.

The following example shows how it can be configured in pipeline.

    -
        name: meter_file
        interval: 600
        counters:
            - ""*""
        transformers:
        publishers:
            - file:///tmp/meters?max_bytes=10000000&backup_count=5

With the above configuration, a set of files named meters can be
found in the /tmp directory. The file names should be meters, meters.1,
meters.2 etc. These files will contain the metering data. Since the
implementation uses rotating log file when max_bytes and backup_count
are specified, one can increase the backup_count and max_bytes to keep
the file for a longer period or use the path to point the file to a
desired location. If no file path specified, the publisher will log an
error and not record any metering data.

There are cases where the timing between the start up
for cinder-volume and cinder-scheduler service can result
in a race where the scheduler doesn't know about the volume-service
until the next periodic update.

This change does attempts to do an easy fix by swapping the start
order of the cinder services to ensure that the scheduler will be
able to receive the volume service capabilities update.

Fixes bug: 1189595

    Add gre tunneling support for the ML2 plugin

    This patch add the type_driver GRE to enable the creation of GRE
    tunnels with the OVS agent.
    No Endpoints ID are managed. Only Endpoint IP are stored in DB,
    and this IP is proposed as an endpoint ID for the OVS agent.
    It also fixes the bug 1201471.

    Implements: blueprint ml2-gre

Then a new paragraph after a newline that explains in more detail any general information about the function, class or method. Example usages are also great to have here if it is a complex class for function. When writing the docstring for a class, an extra line should be placed after the closing quotations. For more in-depth explanations for these decisions see http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/ If you are going to describe parameters and return values, use Sphinx, the appropriate syntax is as follows. :param foo: the foo parameter :param bar: the bar parameter :returns: return_type -- description of the return value :returns: description of the return value :raises: AttributeError, KeyError """""" Dictionaries/Lists ------------------ If a dictionary (dict) or list object is longer than 80 characters, its items should be split with newlines. Embedded iterables should have their items indented. Additionally, the last item in the dictionary should have a trailing comma. This increases readability and simplifies future diffs. Example:: my_dictionary = { ""image"": { ""name"": ""Just a Snapshot"", ""size"": 2749573, ""properties"": { ""user_id"": 12, ""arch"": ""x86_64"", }, ""things"": [ ""thing_one"", ""thing_two"", ], ""status"": ""ACTIVE"", }, } Calling Methods --------------- Calls to methods 80 characters or longer should format each argument with newlines. This is not a requirement, but a guideline:: unnecessarily_long_function_name('string one', 'string two', kwarg1=constants.ACTIVE, kwarg2=['a', 'b', 'c']) Rather than constructing parameters inline, it is better to break things up:: list_of_strings = [ 'what_a_long_string', 'not as long', ] dict_of_numbers = { 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'twenty four': 24, } object_one.call_a_method('string three', 'string four', kwarg1=list_of_strings, kwarg2=dict_of_numbers) Test Skips ---------- If a test is broken because of a bug it is appropriate to skip the test until bug has been fixed. However, the skip message should be formatted so that Tempest's skip tracking tool can watch the bug status. The skip message should contain the string 'Bug' immediately followed by a space. Then the bug number should be included in the message '#' in front of the number. Example:: @testtools.skip(""Skipped until the Bug #980688 is resolved"") openstack-common ---------------- A number of modules from openstack-common are imported into the project. These modules are ""incubating"" in openstack-common and are kept in sync with the help of openstack-common's update.py script. See: http://wiki.openstack.org/CommonLibrary#Incubation The copy of the code should never be directly modified here. Please always update openstack-common first and then run the script to copy the changes across. OpenStack Trademark ------------------- OpenStack is a registered trademark of the OpenStack Foundation, and uses the following capitalization: OpenStack Commit Messages --------------- Using a common format for commit messages will help keep our git history readable. Follow these guidelines: First, provide a brief summary (it is recommended to keep the commit title under 50 chars). The first line of the commit message should provide an accurate description of the change, not just a reference to a bug or blueprint. It must be followed by a single blank line. If the change relates to a specific driver (libvirt, xenapi, qpid, etc...), begin the first line of the commit message with the driver name, lowercased, followed by a colon. Following your brief summary, provide a more detailed description of the patch, manually wrapping the text at 72 characters. This description should provide enough detail that one does not have to refer to external resources to determine its high-level functionality. Once you use 'git review', two lines will be appended to the commit message: a blank line followed by a 'Change-Id'. This is important to correlate this commit with a specific review in Gerrit, and it should not be modified. For further information on constructing high quality commit messages, and how to split up commits into a series of changes, consult the project wiki: http://wiki.openstack.org/GitCommitMessages",19,214

The caching of the CPUStats is now no longer required.

Note that the pipeline.yaml must be updated in deployments, otherwise

    Add gre tunneling support for the ML2 plugin

    This patch add the type_driver GRE to enable the creation of GRE
    tunnels with the OVS agent.
    No Endpoints ID are managed. Only Endpoint IP are stored in DB,
    and this IP is proposed as an endpoint ID for the OVS agent.

    Implements: blueprint ml2-gre

This includes a set of fixes and improvements to os-aggregates:
    - eliminate the action method replacing its functionality with wsgi.action
      decorator.
    - Returns explicity and appropriate status codes for each REST action.
    - Improves information error passed to the user.

In the unit test removes one test that in fact was testing the action method
itself instead of _remove_host and which no longer makes sense since action is
removed.

This changeset only copies the v2 files (implementation and test)
into the appropriate v3 directories unchanged. The copy as-is
will not be loaded by either the v2 or v3 extension loaders. The
second changeset will then make the changes required for it to
work as a v3 extension.

This is being done in order to make reviewing of extension porting
easier as gerrit will display only what is actually changed for v3
rather than entirely new files

This changeset only copies the v2 files (implementation and test)
into the appropriate v3 directories unchanged. The copy as-is
will not be loaded by either the v2 or v3 extension loaders. The
second changeset will then make the changes required for it to
work as a v3 extension.

This is being done in order to make reviewing of extension porting
easier as gerrit will display only what is actually changed for v3
rather than entirely new files

Partially implements blueprint nova-v3-api

Unlike other cinder-manage 'list' commands the 'config list'
option doesn't allow users to specify a filter to limit
the output.  This commit adds the ability to specify
the flag the user wishes to display.

If no flag is specified the default behavior is still to

When fixing bug/1195910, some other failure
cases weren't considered (ie not authorized,
unreachable dest etc).

We should fix this up to handle the various
connection error states accordingly and also
add some hints to the log output to help
determine where to look in case of failure.

In XenServer < 6.2 a hard_shutdown will fail while a clean_shutdown is

Python3 no longer supports the `xrange` builtin because it has
renamed it to range and removed the orignal range, not to mention
the fact that xrange is ugly.

Unfortunately, `range` in Python2 must allocate the entire list
before being used in iteration. This could cause some serious
performance hits if `range` is used with a significant enough
number of elements.

The middle ground is to use the shim provided by `six`.
All `xrange` has been renamed `range` and `range` has become an
alias for `xrange` when running in Python2 environments. This
allows for both Python2 and Python3 to use the method with the
best performance.

Note: There were some cases in which `range` was actually used
to generate a list (mostly for testing purposes). In these
cases the `range` calls are wrapped in `list` calls to provide
the expected list object from the generator returned by `range`.

Currently the filter_all() method of each scheduler filter is run
once for each instance in a request, but for many filters the data
doesn't change during a request.

For example the data used by the AZ filter is pretty static, and
doesn't filter any more hosts on successive runs.  However it is
fairly expensive to run on a large system.

Similarly the ServiceGroup information used by the compute filter
is cached as part of the host status, and doesn't need to be
evaluated more than once per request.

Only filters that are based on data that may change within a
request, for example resource consumption, need to be evaluated
for each instance.

This blueprint introduces a new attribute that allows filters to
declare that they only need to be run once per request. The default
behaviour is left so that a filter is evaluated once for each
instance in a request.

The following existing filters are changed to only evaluate once
per request:

  AggregateInstanceExtraSpecsFilter
  AggregateMultiTenancyIsolation
  AggregateTypeAffinityFilter
  AllHostsFilter
  AvailabilityZoneFilter
  ComputeCapabilitiesFilter
  ComputeFilter
  DifferentHostFilter
  GroupAntiAffinityFilter
  ImagePropertiesFilter
  IsolatedHostsFilter
  SameHostFilter
  SimpleCIDRAffinityFilter

In addition the function that does the check is defined in the
filter base class in a way that a filter that wants to run
(for example) once for every 10 instances in a request could
overload the function and implement its own behaviour.

Ported the nova iptables manager code to neutron, so that we
use iptables-save/restore with the -c flag to save/restore
the chains and rules with their packet:byte counts.  All other
changes were ported as well to keep the code as similar as
possible between the two, although they will be different as
I had to fix other bugs found during testing.

Updated tests accordingly to account for new calls and
input/output changes in formatting.

Changed iptables_firewall code to add iptables rules in the same
order that iptables-save will print them: source/dest, protocol,
sport, dport, target; else iptables_manager won't be able
to find them to preserve their [packet:byte] counts.
Tweaked other rules accordingly as necessary.

Fixed a bug introduced in an earlier version of this patch where
_modify_rules() sometimes wouldn't match an existing rule correctly
if not top=true.

Fixes bug 1125393

This patch fixes the way the BigSwitch plugin ignores 404
errors from the backend controller by allowing HTTP codes
to be selectively ignored on REST calls. This prevents
unnecessary exception handling and failover logic in calls
where 404 codes are acceptable.

Fixes: bug #1200023

The previous logic depended on the truth value of the arguments,
which resulted in calling int() on any object evaluating to True.
For instance, passing in a string that wasn't a number would result

Once implemented, it might look like this:: node_ids = [1, 2, 3] try: with task_manager.acquire(node_ids) as task: task.power_on() states = task.get_power_state() except exception.NodeLocked: LOG.info(_(""Unable to power on nodes %s."") % node_ids) # Get a shared lock, just to check the power state. with task_manager.acquire(node_ids, shared=True) as task: states = task.get_power_state() # instead of generating an exception, DTRT and convert to a list if not isinstance(node_ids, list): node_ids = [node_ids] @property def node(self): """"""Special accessor for single-node tasks."""""" if len(self.resources) == 1: return self.resources[0].node else: raise AttributeError(_(""Multi-node TaskManager "" ""has no attribute 'node'"")) @property def driver(self): """"""Special accessor for single-node tasks."""""" if len(self.resources) == 1: return self.resources[0].driver else: raise AttributeError(_(""Multi-node TaskManager "" ""has no attribute 'driver'""))","determine whether their invocation requires an exclusive lock. For example:: from ironic.conductor import task_manager node_ids = [1, 2, 3] try: # Get an exclusive lock so we can manage power state. # This is the default behaviour of acquire_nodes. with task_manager.acquire(node_ids) as task: task.power_on() states = task.get_power_state() except exception.NodeLocked: LOG.info(_(""Unable to power nodes on."")) # Get a shared lock, just to check the power state. with task_manager.acquire(node_ids, shared=True) as task: states = nodes.get_power_state() In case :class:`TaskManager` does not provide a method wrapping a particular driver function, you can access the drivers directly in this way::",63,18

This validation clashes with one of the objectives of environment
files, which was to allow the environment file to specify
defaults for common parameters, which may not all be represented
in the template.

Users may also have create scripts which would require reduced
customisation if common parameters could just be specified at all times.

This did provide validation which helps with a class of user error,
but in balance the tradeoff isn't worth it.

This reverts commit ea6e95189f623911ed63c613055ad5b2baa647f8.

Getting the uptime of a hypervisor fails because the db query
used to get the service filters out disabled hosts.

Instead we replace that query with one that always gets the
service if it exists, and a check that the sevice is up to
avoid an rpc call to a non running service.

blueprint quantum-security-group

Rule table view
* Add direction and ethertype columns (which are specific to Neutron)
  It may be better to hide ""Direction"" and ""Ether Type"" columns
  unless Quantum security group is enabled.
* Merge ip_protocol/from_port/to_port into one column for better view
* Use ""::/0"" for IPv6 ANY instead of ""0.0.0.0/0""
* Rename ""Source"" column to ""Remote"".
  (The naming ""source"" does not fit egress rules)
* Display security group name in the title of rule detail view

Rule creation form
* New arguments 'direction' and 'ethertype' in security_group_rule_create()
* Set the default value of 'direction' to 'ingress' in forms.handle()
* Rename 'ip_protocol' to 'rule_menu' and 'source' to 'remote'
  Note that rule_menu is retrieved from rule.ip_protocol in the unit tests
  since they are tests for custom TCP/UDP/ICMP rules.

Network abstraction layer for security group management
* Move security group methods to api.network
* Add Neutron security group API implementation
* Move base classes for network abstraction to a separate module
  (api/network_base.py) to avoid circulated import between
  api.network and api.nova/api.neutron

Add a configuration parameter to control Neutron security group support
* Neutron security group support is enabled when Neutron is enabled and
  enable_security_group in OPENSTACK_NEUTRON_NETWORK in settings is True.
* Not all neutron plugins support security group, so we need a way
  to control neutron security group is enabled or not.
* It can be determined by supported extension list from Neutron
  and it is a possible future work.

Move get_int_or_uuid to openstack_dashboard/utils/filters.
* get_int_or_uuid is now used in security_group implementation as
  well as floating IP logics.
* In addition the depth of the directory tree becomes longer and
  it is hard to fit the import line in 80 chars.
  It is a good chance to move it to a common directory.

Add __repr__ to API**Wrapper to make it easier to debug.

Limitations:
Neutron supports per-port security group. security groups can be
associated with a port instead of an instace and each port can have
a different set of security groups. It is not a scope of this BP
and is a future work.

This patch adds a database driver that talks to a remote registry
service, which talks directly to a database back-end. The registry
service implements all the database API public functions that are
actually used from outside the API.

In order to test this patch correctly, it was necessary to add an
auth_token to each context used in the base tests and update that token
were needed.

NOTE: This patch adds tests for the above said driver but, it doesn't
add Visibility tests. The reason is that those tests are meant for
actual database back-ends. Given the ""proxy"" nature of this driver and
the fact that it doesn't do anything on the data returned by the remote
registry service, it isn't worth adding those tests. However, this
review does have support for DriverTests and implements each one of
them.

Sometimes instances stay in DELETED state (vm_state) but are not
marked as deleted in the DB.
The combination of vm_state=DELETED and deleted=0 is a valid
combination but if we found it during the compute manager start-up that is
an indication that something went wrong while we were deleting an instance.
The aim of this change is just to complete the deletion during the compute
mangager start-up for instances found in that state.

The Exception class has a 'message' attribute:

  >>> Exception('foo').message
  'foo'

however, we follow a pattern that results in the attribute being
shadowed by a class attribute:

  >>> class MyException(Exception):
  ...     message = 'Foo %s'

  ...         message = self.message % bar

  ...         message = self.msg_fmt % bar

  'Foo bar'

Avoid this shadowing by using 'msg_fmt' as the name of the class
attribute. Add a test which fails without this fix.

If no networking information is passed to a create request
Nova will connect the instance to all available networks.

In a Quantum configuration, where the user may have many
networks it really doesn't make sense to allow this, as the
network order is critical to most Guests and this approach
non-deterministic.

For example most guest OS's will only automatically configure
the first network which may not be externally route-able thereby
leaving the instance in an un-usable state.

To prevent the user getting into this state, the system should
reject requests with no networking information when more than
one quantum network is available, so that the user is made to
specify them in the required order.

Abstract V3 token provider backend to make token provider pluggable. It enables
deployers to customize token management to add their own capabilities.
Token provider is responsible for issuing, checking, validating, and
revoking tokens. Note the distinction between token 'driver' and 'provider'.
Token 'driver' simply provides token persistence. It does not issue or
interpret tokens.

Token provider is specified by the 'provider' property in the '[token]'
section of the Keystone configuration file.

Partially implemented blueprint pluggable-token-format.

This patch also fixes bug 1186061.

In change If30afdb59d4c4268b97d3d10270df2cc729a0c4c for flexibility
reasons, it was decided to not change the method API.get_instance_bdms
to return legacy format but to change all the places it was called.
Sadly few of them were missed.

This patch adds a legacy flag so that all use-cases still do what is
expected unless explicitly changed to do otherwise.

If you have an EFI host but the image doesn't have the EFI modules
installed the grub-install command will fail in case the --target
argument is not set. The problem is that the grub-install script will
check whether the /sys/firmware/efi file exists or not to determine if

the EFI modules are installed in the image, if not set the --target to

For Neutron we need an additional OVS bridge to be present. The xe
network-create command did not create the bridge immediately. A
workaround was applied to attach a network interface to that network,
forcing xapi to create the underlying OVS bridge. It turned out, that
the xe network-attach command could be used instead, so the workaround
is removed and replaced with the proper solution by this patch.

the v2 or v3 extension loaders. The second changeset will then

Asserts should really only be used in tests. However, if there is a place in the
code where you know a given state should not be possible but perhaps could
happen (for example memory corruption) and you want to trap it in a known place
instead of letting it float through the system in less detectable places assert
can be used. It should be considered a debugging tool and not a way to validate
parameters.

There are few places in neutron where asserts are used in inappropriate manner.

The old failover logic for the BigSwitch plugin modified a
list of controllers as it tested them. If the code for one
thread unexpectedly raised an exception or died, the global
server list could lose a server permanently.
This patch addresses that by flagging servers as failed instead
so the global server list is never modified.

This patch fixes the current situation where we have two sections
regarding configuring hypervisors in compute admin guide. The section
also erroneously stated that its information was useless unless you
had a running install - fixed!

This also makes the breakdown between the default (kvm) and other
hypervisors a bit better.

When we’re talking about High Availability, however, we’re talking about not just one database, but several (for redundancy) and a means to keep them synchronised. In this case, we’re going to choose the MySQL database, along with Galera for synchronous multi-master replication. The choice of database isn’t a foregone conclusion; you’re not required to use MySQL. It is, however, a fairly common choice in OpenStack installations, so we’ll cover it here.Rather than starting with a vanilla version of MySQL and then adding Galera to it, you will want to install a version of MySQL patched for wsrep (Write Set REPlication) from https://launchpad.net/codership-mysql/0.7. Note that the installation requirements are a bit touchy; you will want to make sure to read the README file so you don’t miss any steps. Next, download Galera itself from https://launchpad.net/galera/+download. Go ahead and install the *.rpms or *.debs, taking care of any dependencies that your system doesn’t already have installed. Once you’ve completed the installation, you’ll need to make a few configuration changes: In the system-wide +my.conf+ file, make sure mysqld isn’t bound to 127.0.0.1, and that +/etc/mysql/conf.d/+ is included. Typically you can find this file at +/etc/my.cnf+: ---- [mysqld] ... !includedir /etc/mysql/conf.d/ ... #bind-address = 127.0.0.1 ---- In order to receive a state snapshot from an existing node, a new node must be configured with a MySQL account that can access the other nodes. First specify that account information in +/etc/mysql/conf.d/wsrep.cnf+: ---- wsrep_sst_auth=wsrep_sst:wspass ---- Next connect as root and grant privileges to that user: ---- $ mysql -e ""SET wsrep_on=OFF; GRANT ALL ON *.* TO wsrep_sst@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'wspass'""; ---- You’ll also need to remove user accounts with empty usernames, as they cause problems: ---- $ mysql -e ""SET wsrep_on=OFF; DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE user='';"" ---- Finally, make sure that the nodes can access each other through the firewall. This might mean adjusting iptables, as in: ---- # iptables --insert RH-Firewall-1-INPUT 1 --proto tcp --source <my IP>/24 --destination <my IP>/32 --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT # iptables --insert RH-Firewall-1-INPUT 1 --proto tcp --source <my IP>/24 --destination <my IP>/32 --dport 4567 -j ACCEPT ---- It might also mean configuring any NAT firewall between nodes to allow direct connections, or disabling SELinux or configuring it to allow mysqld to listen to sockets at unprivileged ports. Now you’re ready to actually create the cluster. ===== Creating the cluster In creating a cluster, you first start a single instance, which creates the cluster.

Example:: def list(): return [1, 2, 3] mylist = list() # BAD, shadows `list` built-in class Foo(object): def list(self): return [1, 2, 3] mylist = Foo().list() # OKAY, does not shadow built-in - Use the ""is not"" operator when testing for unequal identities. Example:: if not X is Y: # BAD, intended behavior is ambiguous pass if X is not Y: # OKAY, intuitive pass - Use the ""not in"" operator for evaluating membership in a collection. Example:: if not X in Y: # BAD, intended behavior is ambiguous pass if X not in Y: # OKAY, intuitive pass if not (X in Y or X in Z): # OKAY, still better than all those 'not's pass Imports ------- - Do not import objects, only modules (*) - Do not import more than one module per line (*) - Do not use wildcard ``*`` import (*) - Do not make relative imports - Order your imports by the full module path - Organize your imports according to the following template (*) exceptions are: - imports from ``migrate`` package - imports from ``sqlalchemy`` package - imports from ``heat.db.sqlalchemy.session`` module - imports from ``heat.db.sqlalchemy.migration.versioning_api`` package Example:: # vim: tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 softtabstop=4 {{stdlib imports in human alphabetical order}} \n {{third-party lib imports in human alphabetical order}} \n {{heat imports in human alphabetical order}} \n \n {{begin your code}} Human Alphabetical Order Examples --------------------------------- Example:: import httplib import logging import random import StringIO import time import eventlet import testtools import webob.exc import heat.api.ec2 from heat.api import openstack from heat.auth import users from heat.endpoint import cloud import heat.flags from heat import test Docstrings ---------- Example:: """"""A one line docstring looks like this and ends in a period."""""" """"""A multi line docstring has a one-line summary, less than 80 characters. Then a new paragraph after a newline that explains in more detail any general information about the function, class or method. Example usages are also great to have here if it is a complex class for function. When writing the docstring for a class, an extra line should be placed after the closing quotations. For more in-depth explanations for these decisions see http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/ If you are going to describe parameters and return values, use Sphinx, the appropriate syntax is as follows. :param foo: the foo parameter :param bar: the bar parameter :returns: return_type -- description of the return value :returns: description of the return value :raises: AttributeError, KeyError """""" Dictionaries/Lists ------------------ If a dictionary (dict) or list object is longer than 80 characters, its items should be split with newlines. Embedded iterables should have their items indented. Additionally, the last item in the dictionary should have a trailing comma. This increases readability and simplifies future diffs. Example:: my_dictionary = { ""image"": { ""name"": ""Just a Snapshot"", ""size"": 2749573, ""properties"": { ""user_id"": 12, ""arch"": ""x86_64"", }, ""things"": [ ""thing_one"", ""thing_two"", ], ""status"": ""ACTIVE"", }, } Calling Methods --------------- Calls to methods 80 characters or longer should format each argument with newlines. This is not a requirement, but a guideline:: unnecessarily_long_function_name('string one', 'string two', kwarg1=constants.ACTIVE, kwarg2=['a', 'b', 'c']) Rather than constructing parameters inline, it is better to break things up:: list_of_strings = [ 'what_a_long_string', 'not as long', ] dict_of_numbers = { 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'twenty four': 24, } object_one.call_a_method('string three', 'string four', kwarg1=list_of_strings, kwarg2=dict_of_numbers) Internationalization (i18n) Strings ----------------------------------- In order to support multiple languages, we have a mechanism to support automatic translations of exception and log strings. Example:: msg = _(""An error occurred"") raise HTTPBadRequest(explanation=msg) If you have a variable to place within the string, first internationalize the template string then do the replacement. Example:: msg = _(""Missing parameter: %s"") % (""flavor"",) LOG.error(msg) If you have multiple variables to place in the string, use keyword parameters. This helps our translators reorder parameters when needed. Example:: msg = _(""The server with id %(s_id)s has no key %(m_key)s"") LOG.error(msg % {""s_id"": ""1234"", ""m_key"": ""imageId""}) create virtual environments, populate them with depenedencies and run all of openstack-common ---------------- A number of modules from openstack-common are imported into the project. These modules are ""incubating"" in openstack-common and are kept in sync with the help of openstack-common's update.py script. See: http://wiki.openstack.org/CommonLibrary#Incubation The copy of the code should never be directly modified here. Please always update openstack-common first and then run the script to copy the changes across. OpenStack Trademark ------------------- OpenStack is a registered trademark of the OpenStack Foundation, and uses the following capitalization: OpenStack Commit Messages --------------- Using a common format for commit messages will help keep our git history readable. Follow these guidelines: First, provide a brief summary 72 characters in length or less. The first line of the commit message should provide an accurate description of the change, not just a reference to a bug or blueprint. It must be followed by a single blank line. If the change relates to a specific driver (libvirt, xenapi, qpid, etc...), begin the first line of the commit message with the driver name, lowercased, followed by a colon. Following your brief summary, provide a more detailed description of the patch, manually wrapping the text at 72 characters. This description should provide enough detail that one does not have to refer to external resources to determine its high-level functionality.

Example:: def list(): return [1, 2, 3] mylist = list() # BAD, shadows `list` built-in class Foo(object): def list(self): return [1, 2, 3] mylist = Foo().list() # OKAY, does not shadow built-in - Use the ""is not"" operator when testing for unequal identities. Example:: if not X is Y: # BAD, intended behavior is ambiguous pass if X is not Y: # OKAY, intuitive pass - Use the ""not in"" operator for evaluating membership in a collection. Example:: if not X in Y: # BAD, intended behavior is ambiguous pass if X not in Y: # OKAY, intuitive pass if not (X in Y or X in Z): # OKAY, still better than all those 'not's pass Imports ------- - Do not import objects, only modules (*) - Do not import more than one module per line (*) - Do not make relative imports - Order your imports by the full module path - Organize your imports according to the following template (*) exceptions are: - imports from ``migrate`` package - imports from ``sqlalchemy`` package - imports from ``cinder.db.sqlalchemy.session`` module Example:: # vim: tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 softtabstop=4 {{stdlib imports in human alphabetical order}} \n {{third-party lib imports in human alphabetical order}} \n {{cinder imports in human alphabetical order}} \n \n {{begin your code}} Human Alphabetical Order Examples --------------------------------- Example:: import httplib import logging import random import StringIO import time import unittest import eventlet import webob.exc import cinder.api.ec2 from cinder.api import openstack from cinder.auth import users from cinder.endpoint import cloud import cinder.flags from cinder import test Docstrings ---------- Example:: """"""A one line docstring looks like this and ends in a period."""""" """"""A multi line docstring has a one-line summary, less than 80 characters. Then a new paragraph after a newline that explains in more detail any general information about the function, class or method. Example usages are also great to have here if it is a complex class for function. When writing the docstring for a class, an extra line should be placed after the closing quotations. For more in-depth explanations for these decisions see http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/ If you are going to describe parameters and return values, use Sphinx, the appropriate syntax is as follows. :param foo: the foo parameter :param bar: the bar parameter :returns: return_type -- description of the return value :returns: description of the return value :raises: AttributeError, KeyError """""" Dictionaries/Lists ------------------ If a dictionary (dict) or list object is longer than 80 characters, its items should be split with newlines. Embedded iterables should have their items indented. Additionally, the last item in the dictionary should have a trailing comma. This increases readability and simplifies future diffs. Example:: my_dictionary = { ""image"": { ""name"": ""Just a Snapshot"", ""size"": 2749573, ""properties"": { ""user_id"": 12, ""arch"": ""x86_64"", }, ""things"": [ ""thing_one"", ""thing_two"", ], ""status"": ""ACTIVE"", }, } Calling Methods --------------- Calls to methods 80 characters or longer should format each argument with newlines. This is not a requirement, but a guideline:: unnecessarily_long_function_name('string one', 'string two', kwarg1=constants.ACTIVE, kwarg2=['a', 'b', 'c']) Rather than constructing parameters inline, it is better to break things up:: list_of_strings = [ 'what_a_long_string', 'not as long', ] dict_of_numbers = { 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'twenty four': 24, } object_one.call_a_method('string three', 'string four', kwarg1=list_of_strings, kwarg2=dict_of_numbers) Internationalization (i18n) Strings ----------------------------------- In order to support multiple languages, we have a mechanism to support automatic translations of exception and log strings. Example:: msg = _(""An error occurred"") raise HTTPBadRequest(explanation=msg) If you have a variable to place within the string, first internationalize the template string then do the replacement. Example:: msg = _(""Missing parameter: %s"") % (""flavor"",) LOG.error(msg) If you have multiple variables to place in the string, use keyword parameters. This helps our translators reorder parameters when needed. Example:: msg = _(""The server with id %(s_id)s has no key %(m_key)s"") LOG.error(msg % {""s_id"": ""1234"", ""m_key"": ""imageId""}) openstack-common ---------------- A number of modules from openstack-common are imported into the project. These modules are ""incubating"" in openstack-common and are kept in sync with the help of openstack-common's update.py script. See: http://wiki.openstack.org/CommonLibrary#Incubation The copy of the code should never be directly modified here. Please always update openstack-common first and then run the script to copy the changes across. OpenStack Trademark ------------------- OpenStack is a registered trademark of OpenStack, LLC, and uses the following capitalization: OpenStack Commit Messages --------------- Using a common format for commit messages will help keep our git history readable. Follow these guidelines: First, provide a brief summary (it is recommended to keep the commit title under 50 chars). The first line of the commit message should provide an accurate description of the change, not just a reference to a bug or blueprint. It must be followed by a single blank line. If the change relates to a specific driver (libvirt, xenapi, qpid, etc...), begin the first line of the commit message with the driver name, lowercased, followed by a colon. Following your brief summary, provide a more detailed description of the patch, manually wrapping the text at 72 characters. This description should provide enough detail that one does not have to refer to external resources to determine its high-level functionality. Once you use 'git review', two lines will be appended to the commit message: a blank line followed by a 'Change-Id'. This is important to correlate this commit with a specific review in Gerrit, and it should not be modified.

Some services have common settings in base manager.
For example nova.manager, cinder.manager...

This patch allow to use common manager for cert and cells in nova,
scheduler for nova and cinder.

All logic with registration services and using periodic task will
be implemented in oslo library. For successful use this functionality
some options in config should be redefined in each service:
- db_driver,
- [manager]
	serializer
	use_baserpc

It is a logical grouping of code relating to a portion of the system. In general other components should be using the manager to make changes to the components that it is responsible for. For example, other components that need to deal with volumes in some way, should do so by calling methods on the VolumeManager instead of directly changing fields in the database. This allows us to keep all of the code relating to volumes in the same place. We have adopted a basic strategy of Smart managers and dumb data, which means rather than attaching methods to data objects, components should call manager methods that act on the data. Methods on managers that can be executed locally should be called directly. If a particular method must execute on a remote host, this should be done via rpc to the service that wraps the manager Managers should be responsible for most of the db access, and non-implementation specific data. Anything implementation specific that can't be generalized should be done by the Driver. In general, we prefer to have one manager with multiple drivers for different implementations, but sometimes it makes sense to have multiple managers. You can think of it this way: Abstract different overall strategies at the manager level(FlatNetwork vs VlanNetwork), and different implementations at the driver level(LinuxNetDriver vs CiscoNetDriver). Managers will often provide methods for initial setup of a host or periodic tasks to a wrapping service. This module provides Manager, a base class for managers.

Use the common oslo-incubator rootwrap rather than maintain a
specific fork within Neutron.

- Migrated DnsmasqFilter use in dhcp.filters to the new EnvFilter
- Changed environment passing in ip_lib's netns.execute so that
  it can be properly matched using IpNetNsExecFilter + EnvFilter.
  It now calls ""ip netns exec ns env A=B C=D command"" instead of
  ""A=B C=D ip netns exec ns command"". Adjusted tests accordingly.

All the other changes are coming directly from the Oslo ""rootwrap""
module sync.

Notes:
- Neutron locates its rootwrap.conf in etc/ rather than in etc/neutron
- Neutron maintains a specific bin/quantum-rootwrap-xen-dom0 which
  requires additional config in rootwrap.conf

Both behaviors were preserved in this commit, but this may need to be
addressed in the future to simplify future oslo-rootwrap updates.

This patch fixes the way the BigSwitch plugin ignores 404
errors from the backend controller by allowing HTTP codes
to be selectively ignored on REST calls. This prevents
unnecessary exception handling and failover logic in calls
where 404 codes are acceptable.

This patches allows a storage system to add metadata to a location.
For example, if a location is a file:// URL the storage system may
wish to add information about it like the following:
{'FS': Gluster, 'mountpoint': '/usr/local/', 'namespace': 'abc-efg-xyz'}
Such information can be useful to a client with access to the direct
URL (often times the URL alone cannot encode enough information).

With this change when new data is added to the store a dictionary
is returned along with URL.  That dictionary is then stored in the
DB with the URL.  It is up to each store to determine what is in this
metadata dictionary.  Possible way to do so are with a configuration
file.  This patch does not included storage systems (other than tests)
that set this information.

If the API service is configured with the follow options:

    show_multiple_locations = True

then the location and the location information is returned with the
image information in the field 'locations'.  locations is
a list with the following format:

{'url': '<url>', 'metadata': <a storage specific dict>}

With this patch it will always be a list of one, but future patches
relating to the blueprint multiple-image-locations will allow for more.

blueprint: direct-url-meta-data
blueprint: multiple-image-locations

the existing ratelimit middleware works on a per-container level,
and causes the proxy server to sleep to force clients to slow down. it
almost never returns a 498 response.

This is something different: it's based on the assumption you already
informed your user about a rate limit on your objects.
You then limit how many times
each object (matching a certain string) can be accessed in a certain time,
The measurements are per-object and expire when no new requests have
been seen in the specified time.  Once an object is about to be
requested too often*, swift returns http 498 'rate limit reached',
instead of gently slowing down.

You can configure multiple limitations and specify a string
which must be contained within the path (including querystring) for
the setting to apply.  It falls back to the match-less version, if
specified

Configuration examples:
> 10 reqs, TTL 3600s
object_ratelimit = 10:3600
> same, but only for req paths matching 'temp_url_sig'
object_ratelimit_temp_url_sig = 10:3600

[*] Note that this design is a little racey and causes the actual
amount of allowed requests to be a little higher,
Note also that the counters are maintained in memcache and are subject
to purging or loss on daemon restart.
This is usually all OK if you just want to block abusers (it is for us)
and this keeps the code/design simple and efficient.

From Grizzly, config drive is now supported well in Xen.

However, when using it, it is important to adjust the
 xenapi_disable_agent option, which this patch adds a note
about.

patchset2 adds a new config example snippet for backing storage

patchset3 addresses Diane's comments

The images metadata functionality is moved for the V3 API from
core to an extension and is now accessed via
/os-images/{image_id}/os-image-metadata instead of
/images/{image_id}/metadata.

Consensus appears to be that we continue to need this
functionality for v3 because some deployers disable the public
image endpoint due security concerns and whether this will be
fixed in glance for Havana. Deployers can disable this extension
if they do not want it.

The max-backoff concept prevents the backoff used in _retry to double infinitely (which in turn causes wait times of an hour or more between retries).

Currently property related functions are not consistent with the
database API. As for the create operation, the API returns an
ImageProperty model instead of a dictionary and in the case of the
delete operation, the function expects a property instance instead of a
reference name.

This patch makes both calls consistent by returning a dictionary when a
property is created and receiving a property name instead of its
instance when a property needs to be deleted.

Fixes bug: #1199364
Implements blueprint registry-db-driver

This commit adds back the tempest helper script that
was removed in commit:
  e6c28fdcf7ab1019b77530af91afda736082f8d9

This script was removed citing that we should
use the tempest way of installing deps (tox).

After many,many hours, I cannot figure out how to get
tox working (it somehow messes us my VM network when it runs).
I can however run this simple script to
install the deps to run tempest.

Tox/requirement.txt also install the 'tempest' version of client
libraries, which is undesirable for my use case where I want to
test that a set of packages install the environment correctly.

There are two ways to install it. One is to plug it into existing Dashboard installation and another is to setup another Dashboard and plug Savanna UI there. The first approach advantage is that you will have Savanna UI in the very same Dashboard with which you work with OpenStack. The disadvantage is that you have to tweak your Dashboard configuration in order to enable the plugin. The second approach does not have this disadvantage. Further steps describe installation for the first approach. For the second approach see :doc:`/horizon/dev.environment.guide` 1. Prerequisites ---------------------2) Savanna installed, configured and running.1) Go to the machine where Dashboard resides and install Savanna UI: This will install latest stable release of Savanna UI. If you want to install master branch of Savanna UI:2) Configure OpenStack Dashboard. In ``settings.py`` add savanna to and also add savannadashboard to Note: ``settings.py`` file is located in ``/usr/share/openstack_dashboard/openstack-dashboard/`` by default. 3) Also you have to specify **SAVANNA_URL** in local_settings.py. For example: SAVANNA_URL = 'http://localhost:8386/v1.0' Note: ``local_settings.py`` file is located in ``/usr/share/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard/local/`` by default. 4) Now all installations are done and apache web server can be restarted for the changes to take effect:","Savanna Dashboard Setup1.

Previously when starting the dhcp agent the sync_state() process would
be extremely expensive as it would query quantum server for each network.
In order to improve performance a get_active_networks_info() was added
so this information could be retrieved in one query rather than doing a
query for each active network.

The second part of this patch optimizes the logic to avoid calling
get_dhcp_port(). Previously, this method was called once for each network
which makes a call to get_subnets() and get_ports() unnecessarily as
the dhcp agent can determine itself if it needs to update a port or create a
port for dhcp.

This patch also threads the inital sync process and maintains backwards
compatibility with the previous rpc api.

There was also a trivial change to the nvp_plugin where filters are assumed to
be a dict.

Addresses BP transformer-unit

Provide a new transformer to emit derived counters that represent
the rate of change of existing counters, by retaining the previous
volume and timestamp.

This transformer will supercede the direct emission of derived counters
by pollsters (e.g. cpu_util calculated by the compute CPUPollster).

The target counters are identified either by name.

The scaling can be expressed as either a straight multiplicative
factor or as a string expression to be eval'd.

Configured as per usual via the pipeline.yaml, for example:

    counters:
        - ""cpu""
    transformers:
        - name: ""rate_of_change""
          parameters:
              target:
                  name: ""cpu_util""
                  unit: ""%""
                  type: ""gauge""
                  scale: ""100.0 * (10**9 / resource_metadata.get('cpu_number', 1))""
              replace: False

The VHD format, as implemented in XenAPI, has a hard limit
of 2043GB.

This change ensures if you request an ephemeral disk
greater than this size, multiple disks are attached
to fulfill the space requested in the flavor.

By default each disk is 2000 GB in size, unless

each disk is 1024 GB in size.

Removed unused admin parameter that was unused and removed tests
that were no longer necessary.

Added an option configuration setting SECONDARY_ENDPOINT_TYPE that
will be attempted if the OPENSTACK_ENDPOINT_TYPE does not exist
in the service catalog for the desired service.

The primary use case for this fix is in cloud configurations
where Keystone does not return all endpoint types for each
service, and only does so based on the user's privilege level.

Example use case would be set OPENSTACK_ENDPOINT_TYPE to 'adminURL'
and set SECONDARY_ENDPOINT_TYPE to 'publicURL'.  If adminURL is not
available to the user, then they get the publicURL back.

If SECONDARY_ENDPOINT_TYPE is not set in the settings, then the
current behavior is maintained.

For cluster provisioning prepared images should be used. They already have Apache Hadoop 1.1.2 installed. Here you can find prepared images: * http://savanna-files.mirantis.com/savanna-0.2-vanilla-1.1.2-ubuntu-12.10.qcow2 * http://savanna-files.mirantis.com/savanna-0.2-vanilla-1.1.2-fedora-18.qcow2 Besides, you may build images by yourself using :doc:`diskimagebuilder`. But please keep in mind that if you want to use ""Swift support"" feature ( :doc:`features`) you need to include hadoop patch to image. For more information about patching required by ""Swift support"" feature visit :doc:`hadoop-swift`. Limitations ----------- When user creates or scales a Hadoop cluster using a reference plugin implementation (Vanilla plugin), the cluster topology requested by user is verified for consistency. Currently there are the following limitations in cluster topology for Vanilla plugin: * If namenode and jobtracker are on one node cluster cannot contain datanode or tasktracker running separately; We are planning to remove the restriction according https://blueprints.launchpad.net/savanna/+spec/get-rid-of-slaves-file * Cluster should contain only one namenode and may contain only one jobtracker * Cluster cannot be created if it contains processes without containing corresponding master-processes. E.g. it cannot contain tasktracker is there is no jobtracker ",,34,18

Blueprint collector-stores-events

This will store the raw event in the Events table if enabled.

There are a few caveats:
1. It seems somewhere in the rpc layer is eating any exception
   being raised from the notification handler, so the ack() handling
   code isn't being reached. This will need to be fixed in oslo.

2. notification delivery_info is being stripped from the notification
   before the handler is called. This means we can't get any routing
   info on the notification (which queue did it come in on, for example).
   Again, this will need to be fixed in oslo.

3. The raw json of the event is not currently stored. The model will need
   to be extended to support this. Next.

When a configuration entry is registered by a provisioning plugin, it may be marked as optional.Cluster Topology limitations in Vanilla Plugin ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Before creating a cluster Vanilla plugin will check that the set of Node Groups user has defined for a Cluster can actually work. Currently there are the following limitations in cluster topology for Vanilla plugin: * If namenode and jobtracker are on one node cluster cannot contain datanode or tasktracker running separately; We are planning to remove the restriction according https://blueprints.launchpad.net/savanna/+spec/get-rid-of-slaves-file * Cluster should contain only one namenode and may contain only one tasktracker * Cluster cannot be created if it contains processes without containing corresponding master-processes. E.g. it cannot contain tasktracker is there is no jobtrackerUser may change number of instances in existing Node groups or even add any new Node Groups.Scaling is supported by Vanilla plugin and all validation described above is held. So please see the `Cluster Topology limitations in Vanilla Plugin`_ for more details. If cluster cannot be scaled properly all changes will be rolled back. Swift support ------------- If you want to work with swift, e.g. to run jobs on data located in swift or put jobs` result to swift, you need to use patched Hadoop and Swift. For more info about this patching and configuring please see :doc:`hadoop-swift`. There are a lot of possible configs for swift which can be set but currently Savanna automatically set information about swift filesystem implementation, location awarenass, url and tenant name for authorization in swift. The only required information that is still needed to be set are username and password to access swift. So you need to explicitly specify this params during job running. E.g. : .. sourcecode:: bash hadoop distcp -D fs.swift.service.savanna.username=admin\ -D fs.swift.service.savanna.password=swordfish\ swift://integration.savanna/temp swift://integration.savanna/temp1 How to write swift path? The template is: ``swift://${container}.${provider}/${object}``. We don't need to point out the account because it will be automatically determined from tenant name from configs. Actually, account=tenant. ${provider} was designed to have an opportunity to work with several swifts. E.g. theoretically possibly to read data from swift on one cloud and write it to another. In this case we need to distinguish al least auth-properties rot them. But as for now Savanna automatically generates configs only for one provider (cloud) and calls it ""savanna"". Currently user has only an opportunity to say whether he or she wants to use swift on cluster or not. But there is a blueprint about making swift-access more configurable during cluster creation for both REST API and UI: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/savanna/+spec/swift-configuration-through-rest-and-ui Anti-affinity groups -------------------- One of the problems in Hadoop running on OpenStack is that there is no ability to control where machine is actually running. We cannot be sure that two new virtual machines are started on different hardware. So if cluster runs any replication processes it is not reliable because all replicas may turn up on one hardware. Anti-affinity groups feature provides an ability to explicitly tell Savanna to run specified processes on different compute nodes. This is especially useful for Hadoop datanode-process to make HDFS replicas reliable.","This checks are designed to prevent user form creating incorrectly configured templates or deploying invalid cluster topologies.When a configuration entry is registered by a provisioning plugin, it ma be marked as optional.Cluster Topology validations ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Before launching any VMs Vanilla plugin will check that the set of Node Groups user has defined for a Cluster can actually work. One of such checks is : If there is no Node Group running a NameNode process, but there are DataNodes, HDFS service will not start, so user will get a validation error. One more scenario is: If a Node Group has any of master processes (NameNode or JobTracker) in it and user is going to launch more than one instance in this Node Group, that will also result in a validation error.User may change number of instances in existing Node groups or even add any Node Groups if topology should be changed.Scaling is supported in Vanilla plugin.",54,14

but due to the incorrect node_topic registration in ZMQ.

What have been done in this patch:
*Import the latest impl_zmq.py from oslo.
*Remove self.manager.init_host(). This line will cause error, if ZMQ is chosen
as the MQ.
*Change the delimiter from ""."" to "":"" between topic and host. ""."" will make

*The node_topic should be registered correctly via

blueprint nec-plugin-test-coverage

This commit refactors the base class of unit tests for NEC Plugin to
make writing new tests easier.

Add fake OFC Manager and change unit tests which use OFC Manager mock
to using this fake.  With this fake, we don't need to set return_value
and side_effect to the mock instance of OFC Manager in each test case.
This fake keeps all resources on OFC, and returns existence of
resources properly.  This fake is attached to OFC Manager mock instance
by setting all side_effects.  We can also set it to raise an exception.

Make NEC Plugin configurable in each test case.  Now we can configure
NEC Plugin by setting string in class value ""_nec_ini"" which will be
written into a temporal file and loaded by NEC plugin.

Move setup for callbacks into NecPluginV2TestCase() so that other unit
tests can use callbacks.

When trying to retrieve a Glance image using the v2 api, user will

This is because Glance client expects a response of type content-type:

Fixes bug #1194807

Firstly, we update the oslo.config dep to 1.2.0a3 because of the issue
with namespace packages (bug #1194742).

But the main issue here is that if you currently do:

  $> pip install -r quantum/requirements.txt

then you end up with the oslo.config 1.1.1 code installed. This is
because oslo.config>=1.1.0 gets pulled in as a transitive dep and pip
gets confused. You can reproduce with e.g.

  $> pip install \
       http://.../oslo.config-1.2.0a3.tar.gz#egg=oslo.config-1.2.0a3 \
       python-keystoneclient
  $> pip freeze | grep oslo.config
  oslo.config-1.2.0a3
  $> python -c 'from oslo.config.cfg import DeprecatedOpt'
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File ""<string>"", line 1, in <module>
  ImportError: cannot import name DeprecatedOpt

This is because of a bug with pip where it sees oslo.config-1.2.0a3 and
oslo.config as two unrelated things. It should strip the version part of
the egg= fragment before using it as a package name, but it doesn't.

However, we can simply use the -f/--find-links pip option in our
requirements.txt to add the tarball URL to the list of URLs considered
and also add the oslo.config>=1.2.0a3 dependency:

  $> pip install \
       -f http://.../oslo.config-1.2.0a3.tar.gz#egg=oslo.config-1.2.0a3 \
       'oslo.config>=1.2.0a3' \
       python-keystoneclient
  $> pip freeze | grep oslo.config
  oslo.config-1.2.0a3
  $> python -c 'from oslo.config.cfg import DeprecatedOpt'

This is actually exactly the semantics we want and we go to great
lengths in pbr to get these semantics while using a single tarball URL.
The only downside to this --find-links strategy is that we gain an extra
line in our requirements.txt ... but it does work around the pip bug.

For example, when a user launches a new VM, the Nova scheduler should send the request to a live node (with enough capacity too, of course). From the Grizzly release onward, Nova queries the ServiceGroup API to get the node liveness information.</para> <para>When a compute worker (running the nova-compute daemon) starts, it calls the join API to join the compute group, so that every service that is interested in the information (e.g. the scheduler) will be able to query the group membership, or the status of a particular node. Under the hood, the ServiceGroup client driver will automatically update the compute worker status.</para> <para>Currently there are two drivers implemented: database and ZooKeeper. Further drivers are in review or development, such as memcache.</para> <section> <title>Database ServiceGroup driver</title> <para>The database driver is how Compute has been tracking node liveness since the first release, and it's the default driver. In a compute worker, it periodically sends a db update command to the database, saying ""I'm OK"" with a timestamp. A pre-defined timeout (<literal>service_down_time</literal>) is used to determine if a node is dead.</para> <para> The driver has two limitations, which may or may not be an issue for you, depending on your setup. First, the more compute worker nodes you have, the more pressure you put on the database. Second, the timeout is by default 60 seconds. So, it might take a while to detect node failures. Of course you could try to reduce the timeout value, but you would also need to make the DB update more frequently, which again increases the DB workload.</para> <para>The fundamental issue is, the data to describe whether the node is alive is ""transient"" --- it's basically useless after a couple of seconds. Other data in the database, such as the entries to describe which users own what VMs, are persistent. However, they are treated the same way since they are stored in the same database. This is also part of the motivation where for the ServiceGroup abstraction so that there is the a chance to treat them separately.</para> </section> <section> <title>ZooKeeper ServiceGroup driver</title> <para>The ZooKeeper ServiceGroup driver works by using ZooKeeper ephemeral nodes. ZooKeeper in contrary to databases is a distributed system, and its load is divided among several servers. At a compute worker node, after establishing a ZooKeeper sesion, it creates an ephemeral znode in the group directory. Ephemeral znodes has the same lifespan as the session. If the worker node or the nova-compute daemon crashes, or there is a network partition between the worker and the ZooKeeper server quorums, then the ephemeral znodes are removed automatically. The driver gets the group membership by doing a ""ls"" in group directory. </para> <para>To use the ZooKeeper driver, of course you need to have both ZooKeeper servers and client libraries installed. Setting up ZooKeeper servers is outside the scope of this article. For the rest of the article, let's assume you have them installed, and their addresses / ports are 192.168.2.1:2181, 192.168.2.2:2181, 192.168.2.3:2181. </para> <para>To use ZooKeeper, you'll need two client-side Python libraries on every nova node: <literal>python-zookeeper</literal> - the official Zookeeper Python binding and <literal>evzookeeper</literal> - the library to make the binding work with the eventlet threading model. </para> <para> The relevent configuration snippet in /etc/nova/nova.conf on every node is: <programlisting> servicegroup_driver=""zk"" [zookeeper] address=""192.168.2.1:2181,192.168.2.2:2181,192.168.2.3:2181"" </programlisting> </para> <xi:include href=""../common/tables/nova-zookeeper.xml""/> </section> </section> ",,94,2

In previous code we didn't check whether we have an enabled
backup service there before we send out the rpc request,
results that if no enabled backup service there,the volume will
stays in ""backing-up"" state and the backup will stays in ""creating"".

This patch fixed this issue, we exam whether at least an appropriate
(same host,az as the volume and is_alive) backup service available
before we do the rpc request.

Bug #1086232

We introduce the action=clear to unknown argument part of
the command line. With this option, user can specify which
attribute will have None value.

For example to set dns_nameservers of subnet to None, we use:
quantum subnet-update subnetname --dns_nameservers action=clear

Of course, client command developer can use known option like --no-gateway
to do the same job.

Instance.save() needs to support expected_vm_state when saving changes
as we'll need this when converting cells to use objects.

It also needs to understand whether or not any task_state/vm_state
changes are coming from a forced-reset.  Normally we do not want to
