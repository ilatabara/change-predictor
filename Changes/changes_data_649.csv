The new configuration will directly improve ease of use for operators deploying separate messaging backends for each service. The ability to manage driver specific options will remain necessary for advanced use cases. Problem description =================== The oslo.messaging library provides the ability to separate the messaging backends for RPC and Notification services. While the majority of OpenStack deployments are configured for the use of a single messaging backend (e.g. rabbit broker) there are a number of emergent use cases related to scalability, resiliency and distribution that benefit from the separation of the RPC and Notification communications and the deployment of hybrid messaging backends. These include: * Increasing messaging scale through separate messaging backends * Aligning messaging service patterns via alternative messaging backends (e.g. brokerless messaging for RPC communications) * Incorporating distributed streaming platforms as the messaging backend for events and telemetry applications * Utilizing external messaging systems separate from the OpenStack infrastructure * Distributing OpenStack services across large geographies (FOG/Edge) The oslo.messaging configuration has incrementally evolved over a number of releases and does not fully address the requirements to separate RPC and Notification across hybrid messaging backends. In addition to challenges with separating the backends, other option constraints affect usability and limit an operator's ability to easily switch across the messaging backends. The current configuration constraints include: * Many SSL and connection management options are singletons and therefore can not be independently configured for more than one backend. * There is no consistency or uniformity of common options across the supported drivers. * Most of the required options are embedded in driver specific configuration making a switch to an alternate backend difficult (e.g. level of effort across diverse configuration management frameworks) * Not all drivers support the expected set of capabilities * Incorrect configuration can lead to mis-use of messaging backends The basis for oslo.messaging to separate the backends is through configuration of the transport_url [1]_. This configuration option deprecates the legacy user and host/port definitions that established driver communication with a messaging system. To completely separate the messaging backends, additional options are necessary and must be distinct for RPC and Notification services. Configuration Scenarios ----------------------- The following scenarios depict the support needed for RPC and Notification messaging backends. The scenarios require the ability to separate RPC and Notification communications as well as to utilize homogeneous or hybrid messaging backend systems. Scenario 1 - Single Transport, Single Backend ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ In this scenario, the RPC and Notification services use the same transport configuration to connect to the messaging backend. The singular Messaging System(1) services both RPC and Notification communications.:: +-----------+ +-----------+ | RPC | | Notify | | Service | | Service | +-----+-----+ +-----+-----+ | | | | +--------+--------+ | | +-----+-----+ | Messaging | | System(1) | +-----------+ Scenario 2 - Separate Transports, Single Backend ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ In this scenario, the RPC and Notification services use separate transport configurations to connect to the messaging backend. The singular Messaging System(1) services both RPC and Notification communications.:: +-----------+ +-----------+ | RPC | | Notify | | Service | | Service | +-----+-----+ +-----+-----+ | | | | +----+ +----+ | | | | +-+-------+-+ | Messaging | | System(1) | +-----------+ Scenario 3 - Separate Transports, Dual Backends ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ In this scenario, the RPC and Notification services use separate transport configurations to connect to independent messaging backends. The messaging backends may be the same or different (e.g. hybrid) system types. The Messaging System(1) services RPC communications and the Messaging System(2) services Notification communications.:: +-----------+ +-----------+ | RPC | | Notify | | Service | | Service | +-----+-----+ +-----+-----+ | | | | | | | | | | +-----+-----+ +-----+-----+ | Messaging | | Messaging | | System(1) | | System(2) | +-----------+ +-----------+ Proposed change =============== There are a number of issues that need to be addressed in order for oslo.messaging configuration to fully support separate RPC and Notification backends and improve ease-of-use when switching across messaging systems: * separate RPC configuration * comprehensive RPC and Notification options RPC Configuration Options ------------------------- To provide configuration symmetry for the RPC and Notification communications to the messaging backends, a configuration group with a comprehensive set of options will be added:: _rpc_opts = [ cfg.StrOpt('transport_url', secret=True, help='A URL representing the RPC messaging driver to use and ' 'its communication configuration to connect to the messaging ' 'system.'), cfg.StrOpt('control_exchange', default='openstack', help='The default exchange under which topics are scoped. May ' 'be overridden by an exchange name specified in the ' 'transport_url option.'), cfg.BoolOpt('ssl', default=False, help='Connect over SSL for RPC messaging.'), cfg.StrOpt('ssl_version', default='', help='SSL version to use.'), cfg.StrOpt('ssl_key_file', default='', help='Private key PEM file used to sign ssl_cert_file' ' certificate.'), cfg.StrOpt('ssl_cert_file', default='', help='Self-identifying certificate PEM file' ' for client authentication.'), cfg.StrOpt('ssl_ca_file', default='', help=""CA certificate PEM file used to verify the server's"" ' certificate.'), ... """""" ] This option group will contain all the communication options related to the RPC transport and the messaging backend. To provide symmetry with the operation of the Notification, a modification to the oslo.messaging API has been proposed [3]_ to disambiguate *get_transport* with an explicit *get_rpc_transport* call. This should reduce the potential for mis-use when backends are separated [4]_ as well as provide the context for the RPC options. The RPC options will be added to the oslo_messaging opts.py:: _global_opt_lists = [ drivers_base.base_opts, zmq_options.zmq_opts, server._pool_opts, client._client_opts, transport._transport_opts, ] _opts = [ (None, list(itertools.chain(*_global_opt_lists))), ('matchmaker_redis', zmq_matchmaker_redis.matchmaker_redis_opts), ('oslo_messaging_zmq', zmq_options.zmq_opts), ('oslo_messaging_amqp', amqp_opts.amqp1_opts), ('oslo_messaging_notifications', notifier._notifier_opts), ('oslo_messaging_rpc', rpcer._rpc_opts), ('oslo_messaging_rabbit', list( itertools.chain(amqp.amqp_opts, impl_rabbit.rabbit_opts, pika_connection_factory.pika_opts, impl_pika.pika_pool_opts, impl_pika.message_opts, impl_pika.notification_opts, impl_pika.rpc_opts))), ('oslo_messaging_kafka', kafka_options.KAFKA_OPTS), ] Complete Communication Parameters for RPC and Notifications ----------------------------------------------------------- Add to the RPC and Notification configuration all the options necessary for independent driver communication to separate messaging backends. This would include: Transport Options:: transport_url driver (Notify) control_exchange (RPC) topics (Notify) persistence (Notify) SSL Options:: ssl ssl_version ssl_key_file ssl_cert_file ssl_ca_file ssl_key_file_pw ssl_ciphers ssl_cert_reqs Login Options:: login_methods Message Communication Options:: send_timeout send_retry_delay send_retry_limit reply_timeout (RPC only) reply_retry_delay (RPC only) reply_retry_limit (RPC only) response_timeout (RPC only) prefetch_limit use_message_ack Connection Options:: connection_retry_interval connection_retry_backoff connection_retry_max_interval connection_retry_max_attempts connection_failover_action Heartbeat Options:: idle_timeout heartbeat_interval missed_heartbeat_limit Update Driver Option Handling ----------------------------- Each individual driver will need to incorporate the new RPC and Notification options. The drivers will need to distinguish the RPC from Notification options and for each option, the driver should: * override the default value as appropriate * update the deprecate attributes to convey option mappings * validate the configuration option settings * generate an error/warning if values set for unused/ignored options Drivers should release note any condition where the update to RPC and Notification options will result in a functional change to the driver behavior. File Changes ------------ The following additions will be included in this update: new files: * rpc option file (such as oslo_messaging/rpc/rpcer.py) changed files: * oslo.messaging/oslo_messaging/opts.py * oslo.messaging/oslo_messaging/conffixture.py * oslo.messaging/oslo_messaging/notify/notifier.py Alternatives ------------ Retain the current configuration with its inherent weaknesses in defining and managing the configuration lifecycle of separate messaging backends. Impact on Existing APIs ----------------------- Users will get additional functionality from oslo.messaging Users will get more granularity of configuration if they adopt alternative messaging backends and hybrid deployments. Security impact --------------- N/A Performance Impact ------------------ N/A Configuration Impact -------------------- This will affect configuration management frameworks such as puppet [5]_ and ansible based openstack projects that manage oslo.messaging parameters for installation and deployments. Historically, these have had fixed configurations for a single driver such as rabbit and have recently been updated to utilize transport_urls for separated backend specifications. Developer Impact ---------------- This will affect oslo.messaging driver developers that move to support separation of RPC and Notification options and properly handle unsupported features. Any new configuration added should adhere to the revised options model before introducing driver specific options. Testing Impact -------------- Testing should include the scenarios specified above across the combinatoral matrix of supported drivers. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ansmith@redhat.com (ansmith on IRC) Other contributors: kgiusti@gmail.com (kgiusti on IRC) Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: pike Work Items ---------- * Implement new RPC configuration options * Add option parameters to RPC and Notifications configuration group * Map/Manage current driver specific configuration with RPC and Notification options * Update documentation * Unit/Functional tests update and integration * Upstream CI integration/new hybrid scenarios Incubation ========== N/A Adoption -------- Adoption is expected to adhere to the existing configuration lifecycle policy. Library ------- oslo.messaging Anticipated API Stabilization ----------------------------- N/A Documentation Impact ==================== The library's documentation will need to be updated for the revised configuration options [6]_. The documentation for each driver may also need to be updated according to the changes implied by the new common driver configuration. Dependencies ============ The configuration changes should require no additional dependencies. References ========== ..

The allocated_capacity_gb is being calculated by the core Cinder code and then
added to the driver provided stats, but it only works if the driver is
reporting data of pools and it doesn't work if they are reporting the
stats as the whole backend.

When reporting stats as the whole backend, which is the case of the RBD
driver, we will not send allocated_capacity_gb to the manager.

This patch fixes this by adding the stats from the special fixed pool
that is created by the _count_allocated_capacity method for drivers that
don't report pools information on stats from drivers that don't report
pools information.

Partly in response to [1], and partly for the sake of making its API
consistent and understandable, discover._version_between now allows
un-normalized input, and responds sensibly to unspecified upper & lower
bounds.

Previously the method treated None as follows:

min_version  max_version  behavior
None         None         Always False
not None     None         ValueError
not None     not None     Compare min to candidate

That's whack, yo.  Took me like ten minutes just to come up with that
chart.

This change allows us to explain clearly what happens when upper or
lower bounds are None: it translates naturally to ""there is no bound"".

Given that, the first line of the chart (None/None) now always returns
True, which is a behavior change the callers need to be updated to
expect.  This is an acceptable sacrifice for making this method sane.

When a node is unprovisioned with cleaning enabled it moves into the
CLEANING state which exclusively locks the node.

A node will remain in CLEANING state and therefore locked until the node
moves into the CLEAN_WAIT state, this can take as long as it takes to
decommission the node and power it back on for booting the cleaning
ramdisk. This can take a surprisingly long amount of time with real

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================== Freezer protection plugin ========================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/karbor/+spec/freezer-protection-plugin Problem description =================== Currently, Karbor provides some default protection plugins to protect nova instances or cinder volumes etc. We should increase support for more protection plugins to feet user's needs more flexibly in different scenarios. Freezer is a distributed backup restore and disaster recovery as a service platform. Now it supports the backup of nova instances and cinder volumes which are controlled by OpenStack environment. At the same time, Freezer can backup the resources to the storage medias outside the OpenStack environment or different storage medias in a backup. So it will be useful to introduce Freezer as a protection plugin for Karbor. With Freezer, we will have more strategies to protect our cloud resources. Use Cases ========= Users who want to use Freezer as a backup restore service for their OpenStack environment. Proposed change =============== Freezer protection plugin ------------------------- Freezer protection plugin which supports project, server, volume, image and network resource types need be implemented. For project, freezer will backup all the resources (tenant backup implemented in Freezer). For server, freezer will backup a specify nova instance (if the instance was image boot, Freezer will backup the image and network; if the instance was volume boot, Freezer will backup the system volume). For volume, freezer will backup a specify cinder volume. For image and network, freezer will do nothing as it do not support backup these two types of resources independently. A new protection plugin about Freezer need be implemented. 1. Protect Operation: In main hook of this operation, freezer client will be called to create a freezer job which contains backup actions to do the backup of protectable resources. After the backup, the freezer job and its actions will be deleted. 2. Restore Operation: In main hook of this operation, freezer client will be called to create a freezer job which contains restore actions to do the restore of protectable resources. After the restore, the freezer job and its actions will be deleted. 3. Delete Operation: In main hook of this operation, freezer client will be called to create a freezer job which contains admin actions to delete of backup of the resources. After the deletion, the freezer job and its actions will be deleted.

'progname' is actually only fullfilled for Openstack services logs.
They are missing for MariaDB and RabbitMQ logs.
When using Kibana, ""progname"" field appears empty, hence it's difficult
to known where logs comes from.

Actually a unique 'tail' source is used for all logs files in
kolla/*/*.log.

So log files from services like: chrony, elasticsearch, etcd, grafana,
influxdb, kibana, mongodb... are actually processed by our Fluentd
config, but should not cause all following config will failed to parse
them. It just uses CPU for nothing cause they will
never match the following filters:
* record_transformer => add Hostname, Logger, programname field
* rewrite_tag_filter => rewrite 'programname' TAG if needed

Hence these filters should only be applied to Openstack services logs to
avoid CPU usage.

Furthermore WGI and Apache logs files must be treated differently.

Change Ifd09bd0128ed74347c984a3dcca1304336853865 in the
scheduler will create allocations for the destination
compute node when doing a move operation. It assumes
the instance is being migrated because it has an
existing allocation on another resource provider.

So at that point, the instance would have allocations
against more than one compute node resource provider.

When the move operation is complete, the instance should
be tracked on the destination compute node but we
want to avoid the source compute node resource tracker
from thinking that just because it is no longer tracking
the instance it can delete all of the instance allocations,
which maybe against not only itself but other resource
providers, like the destination node (or shared storage
providers for that matter).

So this change add some sanity checking to
delete_allocation_for_instance such that the allocations
are not deleted if the source node is not allocated for
that instance anymore - which could be due to a race with
the destination node overwriting the allocations. We also
check if there is more than one compute resource provider
in the allocations, including the source node provider,
and in that case log a warning that we're removing those
things, more or less as a breadcrumb in case we're racing
and hit weird issues. The destination node would auto-heal
in this case during the update_available_resource periodic
task.

Using the same name for two different subnet pools means that one needs
to reference them by their UUID. Choosing unique names will allow us to
use the name to reference the pool later on.

At the same time simplify the command used for pool creation by
instructing OSC to only output the value that we are interested in.

Currently, to_primitive tries to iterate through all addresses in the
network, because the type doesn't have a special handling that would
short curcuit it, but also has __iter__. This may be detrimental to
performance, up to the point of node crash due to memory exhaustion if
the passed network range is too large (think of 0.0.0.0/0 or even
2001::/64). This behavior also makes it impossible to restore the
original data format (CIDR).

This patch short curcuits the iteration by handling the IPNetwork type
as a special case, same as we do for IPAddress.

This patch allows a periodic task to shut down the inspector upon a
(critical) failure.  This is needed in case of a (future) PXE filter driver
malfunction to avoid inspector running with a broken filter.

The test_wsgi_service unit test module was refactored to address test
ordering dependency issues and to enhance the mocking.

So, this is an idea I've been poking around for a bit. TBH, I ran this
idea through some folks last year but it didn't seem to be the right
moment for it. During the last elections, Matt asked[0] a question about
inclusiveness in the TC, which resulted in myself[1] and ttx[2]
proposing this idea.

Now, down to business. From a practical perspective, most of the
discussions we have at a TC level happen (or should happen) on gerrit
and the mailing list. Lately, most of our meetings have been mostly
useful to rubber stamp things that we've voted on already on gerrit.

This is not to say that meetings are useless and that we don't have any
interesting discussions during these meetings. We do, in fact, have some
more heated discussions during our meetings from time to time but they
are not as freequent as they used to be.

So, instead of having a blocked hour, every week, for the TC meeting,
I'd like to propose we drop the meetings entirely and, instead,
encourage discussion in #openstack-dev. Here's are some things I think
this would give us:

- Possibility for arranging more focused discussions with stackholders
  on hours that work best. The smaller the group, the easier it is to
  pick a time.

- More open and transparent discussions as it'll force everyone to
  discuss things using gerrit and the mailing list instead of waiting
  for meetings to happen.

- It'll be easier for folks to stay up-to-date with the on-going
  discussions as we'll be reducing one channel of communication and
  focus on the other 2 we're already using.

- It'll be easier for folks (especially non-native English speakers) to
  participate in the discussions as it'll allow them to take their time
  to do it.

Furthermore, most of the discussions that used to happen during the Technical Committee meetings have been superseded by the use of tools like Gerrit and the openstack-dev mailing list. The Technical Committee meetings, which happen in a weekly basis on Tuesdays 20:00 UTC, will be dropped entirely in favor of more open and asynchronous tools like Gerrit and the OpenStack development mailing list in order to improve participation for folks in different time-zones, to ease the participation of non-native English speakers, to reduce the number of means through which governance discussions happen, and to make it easier for the community to follow-up on what's being discussed by the Technical Committee. Ad-Hoc meetings with the stakeholders for specific topics can happen but the results of these discussions should be published on gerrit (assuming there's a review in progress) and/or the mailing list.

By enabling direct I/O path provides stable I/O path for VMs and improve throughput to VMs. Problem description =================== Current LVM driver only supports I/O path from VMs to storage through SCSI target such as tgtd or LIO. Using SCSI target has many benefits, whereas there are some concerns as follows. 1. VMs can't issue I/O to the storage directly. If the target stops accidentally, all I/O from VMs stops and VMs might be crashed. 2. Total I/O bandwidth is limited to bandwidth of a node which has Cinder volume service because of SCSI target. ex. Total I/O bandwidth is, control node(10Ggps) This proposal adds support for a LVM(Volume Group) on a shared storage volume to LVM driver. Supporting shared VG between control node and compute nodes enables following. 1. Each node can access simultaneously a single VG on the shared storage directly from their own I/O path. 2. Every LV(Logical Volume) on the VG is also visible with a own I/O path on each control and compute nodes by using LVM metadata. As a result, VMs which have Cinder volume can issue I/O directly to backend storage via FC/iSCSI. These are benefits of shared LVM driver. 1. Stability of I/O path will be improved, because this driver does not require SCSI target. 2. Total I/O bandwidth will be improved, because each control and compute nodes can use own I/O path directly. ex. Total I/O bandwidth is, control node(10Ggps) + compute(10Gbps)xN. 3. Reduce workloads of control node because tgtd or LIO Target are not necessary. Use Cases --------- Here is a use case for this proposal. Commonly volume operations such as creation, deletion, snapshot etc. are restricted to system administrators because volume operations might be affects all storage user. Thus these operations used to handled system administrator after carefully examining status of storage. However, in OpenStack cloud environment, every user has a permission to run storage operations via Cinder. This causes increase of storage workloads and it is difficult to manage the workloads because user does not care storage status. In order to use expensive storage more efficiently, I think it is better to reduce hardware based storage workload by offloading the workload to software based volume operation on a case by case basis. If Cinder is available two drivers in regards to a storage, user can choice appropriate volume type as the situation demands. For example, 1. As for ""Standard"" type storage, use proposed software based LVM Cinder driver. ex. Quicker volume creation and snapshot are available. 2. As for ""High performance"" type storage, use hardware based Cinder driver. Higher charge than ""Standard"" volume. ex. Efficient snapshot/clone/mirroring features are available. Proposed change =============== 1. Introduce SharedLVMDriver class to cinder/volume/drivers/sharedlvm.py This driver inherit LVMVolumeDriver so that this driver can provide same volume operations as LVMiSCSI driver. * create_volume * delete_volume * create_snapshot * delete_snapshot * copy_image_to_volume * copy_volume_to_image * create_cloned_volume * backup_volume * restore_backup * get_volume_stats * extend_volume * manage_existing * migrate_volume 2. Introduce LVM snapshot creation feature using Assisted snapshot - In order to take an online snapshot for Cinder volume using this driver, assisted snapshot is necessary because LVM snapshot must be taken a node which issues I/O to original volume. Also online snapshot delete is necessary using assisted snapshot. Currently, assisted snapshot is already supported for gluster. This proposal adds assisted snapshot support for this driver. - Add @utils.synchronize decorator for operations which updates LVM metadata to run volume operation exclusively. LVM holds management region including metadata of volume-group configuration information. If multiple nodes(cinder&computes) update the metadata simultaneously, the metadata will be broken. Therefore, exclusive access control is required. The operations which updates metadata are followings. * create_volume * delete_volume * create_snapshot * delete_snapshot * create_cloned_volume * extend_volume * migrate_volume Alternatives ------------ None. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- Thinly-Provisioned Logical Volumes(LVM) is not available because mechanism of thin volume is not cluster safe. Performance Impact ------------------ There is performance impact of IOPs by using LVM compared to using a raw storage volume, but the impact is subtle. Other deployer impact --------------------- To apply this feature to OpenStack environment, storage admin needs following preparations. 1. Prepare a storage volume which is shared between Cinder node and compute nodes. And also admin needs to create a volume group on top of the storage volume. 2. Configure cinder.conf to use sharedLVM driver and the created storage volume as a Cinder backend-storage. Here is a sample of cinder.conf:: enabled_backends=SharedLVM [SharedLVM] volume_group=cinder-shared-volume volume_driver=cinder.volume.drivers.lvm.SharedLVMDriver volume_backend_name=SharedLVM Developer impact ---------------- None.

Currently, previous page in checkpoints pagination not

because that checkpoints in karbor do not need reverse

_finish_resize executes in the context of the errors_out_migration
decorator of the finish_resize function which calls it. It sets
migration status to 'finished' when the migration completes before
sending instance notifications. errors_out_migration_ctxt doesn't set
the migration to error status unless it is 'migrating', or
'post-migrating', so an error sending instance notifications will not
set the migration to an error state, which is what we want.

The interaction with the status check in errors_out_migration_ctxt is
not obvious to a maintainer. It is also problematic, and we remove it
in change Ib6156d8e. This change reduces the lexical scope of
errors_out_migration to the code where we want an error to be set.
This is both immediately obvious to a maintainer, and allows us to
later remove the status check in errors_out_migration_ctxt.

In adding a test for the reduced scope, we also refactor
test_finish_resize_failure to reuse its suite of finish_resize mocks.
We take the opportunity to remove unnecessary mocks and simplify
others, and to remove assertions which don't relate to code
correctness or what we're testing.

Also,

- Remove unused context from midonet scenarios.

- Enlarge the subnet for for NetworkPlugin.create_routers to avoid
  ""Unexpected error: increment exceeds address boundary!""

- Comment out sla sections for some failing scenarios because their
  failure ratios seem too high for a voting job.

This moves the notify_security_groups_member_updated calls
outside of ML2 into a callback in the security groups RPC
base.

This will allow us to ultimately stop overriding the
create/delete/update port inheritance in ML2.

This results in a small behavior change internally for bulk
port creation operations where the notifier will be called
once for each port rather than once for all ports. We can
revisit this in the future if it turns out to be problematic
but right now the bulk port creation API is rarely anyway
since it's mostly a hidden feature (lack of client support).

The Pike release of OpenStack now comes bundled with Ceph 12.x
which requires ceph-mgr in order to run properly.  This patch
installs it.

The ceph-mgr service is not available in 10.x which is what
CentOS ships, we can drop the conditional once CentOS ships
the latest stable Ceph release.

When using Cinder with LVM, it requires a utility which is included
in the thin-provisioning-tools packages which do not get installed
alongside the Cinder packages.

This patch ensures that the correct package is installed when using
the iSCSI LVM backend.

Use a separate config_volume for swift_ringbuilder puppet_config tasks.
This is necessary so that the swift_ringbuilder and swift-storage
services don't both rsync files to the same bind mounted directory.

The rsync command from docker-puppet.py uses --delete-after, so when
they both use the same config_volume, they can end up deleting the files
generated by the other (depending on the order of execution).

Even though a separate config_volume is used, the rings must still end up
in /etc/swift for the swift services containers.  An additional
container init task is used to copy the ring files into
/var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/swift/etc/swift so that they will
be present when the actual swift services containers are started.

Previously, the `openstack overcloud container image prepare` looked
only at the resource registry -- checking if a resource pointed to
a containerized service -- to determine which images to use without
looking at the list of services that are enabled or not per roles.

This commit introduces a new '--roles-file' option to the  command to
specify the path to the roles file when not using the default.

When using Cinder with LVM, it requires a utility which is included
in the thin-provisioning-tools packages which do not get installed
alongside the Cinder packages.

This patch ensures that the correct package is installed when using
the iSCSI LVM backend.

Let's add a healthcheck for the clustercheck container.
We look for host and port in the /etc/xinetd.d/galera-monitor file
and if they should not be set or present we use port 9200 and the
hostname itself as default.

Since the clustercheck container uses the very same mariadb container
image, we test for xinetd's process and configuration file to decide
if we are using the container image for clustercheck or for mariadb.

We currently execute the whole of resize_instance in the context of
the errors_out_migration decorator, meaning that any error will result
in the migration objection being set to error. However, we cast the
migration process to the destination compute before sending local
notification before sending instance notifications from the source
host. This means that an error sending instance notifications on the
source compute would set the error state of a migration which is
currently executing on a different compute host. Setting error here
isn't appropriate, as well as being a race.

Here we reduce the scope of errors_out_migration to end immediately
after the cast to the destination compute.

In adding a test for the reduced scope, we also refactor
test_resize_instance_failure to reuse its suite of resize_insetance
mocks. We take the opportunity to remove unnecessary mocks and
simplify others, and to remove assertions which don't relate to code
correctness or what we're testing.

Currently the pull_source defaults to ""docker.io"". This is unnecessary
as docker.io is the default registry anyway when no registry is
specified in the namespace.

Also having this default prevents fully qualified image paths being

The block driver will fail when attempting to perform a Cinder delete
when the volume does not exist on the backend. The Cinder volume status
is then set to error_deleting even though the volume no longer exists.
This fix logs a warning if the volume doesn't exist on the backend and
allows Cinder to successfully remove the Cinder volume.

This follows the RabbitMQ docs [1] for enabling TLS for the replication
traffic. It reuses the certificate that rabbitmq already has.

Unfortunately, pacemaker uses the shortname for the rabbitmq nodes, so
we are not able to do proper verification of the certificates, since we
can't allocate a certificate for shortnames. So, until pacemaker can
track the rabbit nodes through their FQDNs, we don't set any verification
options.

Tempest only supports a single value for its ""stack_owner_role""

Heat, on the other hand supports multiple values for the corresponding

Add a new configuration parameter called ""stack_owner_roles"" which

The containerized implementation of tacker is incomplete in THT,
and relies on the pre-pike single ""tacker"" container. Container
builds using the final pike release of kolla build three tacker
containers to have seperate conductor and server containers.

According to this bug[1], tacker does not even work without this
conductor. Our scenario job needs to be updated to actually test
tacker is working.

This will need to be backported to pike, and we can work on
better supporting tacker in containers in queens.

Devstack set the docker cluster store to point to the etcd cluster
in current host. In multinode gate, each node setup an independent
etcd cluster so docker in each host uses an independent store.
This will result in an issue that resources (i.e. network) created
in one node cannot be found in another node.

This commit fix it by making all nodes use the same etcd cluster
in service host.

These two URLs can be the same, but sometimes people would like to use an internal URL for auth_url and a public URL for auth_uri. **client.auth_url** is used by the common.client module to construct a client to get authentication and access other services, it can be the either internal or public endpoint of keystone, depends on how the module can reach keystone. **client.identity_url** is no longer used in code since Pike release so you can simply ignore it, we will deprecate and remove this option later.

When updating the rows in batch the DB would try to lock all rows even
if they don't answer the WHERE clause. This would include freshly
inserted rows, which were locked.
This would then cause a deadlock if the inserted row had a dependency on
a row already locked by the cleanup transaction, as the DB tries to low
both entries referenced by the dependeices table's foreign keys.

Updating the rows one by one avoids this unnecessary complication.

`delete_row(...)` was deleting by `id` which is not existing in the
OpenDaylightJournal model. To solve it, it now deletes by `seqnum` which
is the correct PRIMARY KEY for it.

This was not a problem before, because the function was never called
with that parametrization and also unit tests weren't present for it.
This now adds unit tests to avoid the problem in the future.

As it stands, between the moment that a dependency is calculated and the
new entry is recorded in the journal, an operation can ocurr that would
make the dependency irrelevant. If that is the case, the operation fails
with a `oslo_db.exception.DBReferenceError` that is not being caught by
`neutron.db.api.is_retriable` and thus ends with an error thrown to the
log and an unexpected result on the caller.

This was modified to catch that exception and then signal `is_retriable`
to retry the operation again, which would calculate the dependencies
again and try to insert again. This is done by raising a
`oslo_db.exception.RetryRequest` on a `DBReferenceError`.

Currently the pull_source defaults to ""docker.io"". This is unnecessary
as docker.io is the default registry anyway when no registry is
specified in the namespace.

Also having this default prevents fully qualified image paths being
specified in the imagename. This is desirable now that we use full
paths in the heat parameters.

This also allows the prepare command to deprecate the --pull-source
argument and document having full image paths in the --namespace
argument.

Change Ifef08033043a4cc90a6261e962d2fdecdf275650 moved the stonith
property definition to the pacemaker_master node. This means that the
Class['tripleo::fencing'] -> Class['pacemaker::stonith'] ordering
breaks on non-boostrap pacemaker nodes because the pacemaker::stonith
property is not defined there any longer.

Let's fix this by simply using a resource collector and set the ordering
on that instead of adding yet anoth if statement. Ordering on
enablement of stonith is actually more correct formally.

Tested this on a broken setup successfully.

Until now, DNAT app maintained its own patch ports towards the external
network and classified the relevant traffic in table 0. This falls into
the responsibility of provider/tunneling apps now.

This patch removes a lot of the functionality done by provider / L2 apps.
DNAT apps marks the binding of floating port and emits a relevant event,
making it remote or local to other apps, and any traffic directed to
floating ports is forwarded to EGRESS table with relevant reg7 set. This lets
DNAT apps to focus on just the translation part.

There is nothing RedHat specific in these scripts apart from the
DEVICE variable usage. As such, detect the running distro, set a new
variable, and use it in these scripts so they can be shared by both
SUSE and RedHat distributions. Moreover, the 'ip' utility may not

The intended functionality for ""enabled: no"" on sysctl configurations
was to skip the config entirely and leave the variable unaltered.
However, setting ""enabled: no"" was causing the configuration to be
removed entirely.

This patch ensures that any sysctl variables with ""enabled: no"" are
skipped and left unaltered.

The pre-existing configuration for swift on devstack set's the
*-server's devices option (the root of the servers list of devices) to:

    devices = /opt/stack/data/swift/1

where ""1"" is the node_number, and will be 2, 3, ... N if the devstack
machine is built with more than one swift node/device (pretty sure no
one does that on devstack ever).

The device(s) in the rings are named (perhaps confusingly similar to the
swift loopback image) just ""sdb1"", so all storage servers expect to have
a $STACK_USER writeable file system at:

    os.path.join(<devices_root>, ""sdb1"")

That directory does not exist when you start up a devstack [1].

Currently Swift's object-server's require that directory exist before
they write data into it (even with mount_check = false!).

Unfortunately however, with mount_check=false the account/container
servers are able to create the device directory when it does not exist
[2].  Which can lead to some unfortunate results with permissions on
some deployments using mount_check = false (e.g. testing or
containerized environments).  Fixing this issue [3] uncovered the
previously benign [4] mis-configuration in devstack.

Previously, certmonger tried to reload haproxy every time after a
certificate is requested. This is useful for certificate resubmits or
renewals. However, it turned out problematic on installation, when
haproxy is not yet active, as it would try many times and end up having
a race-condition with puppet.

This checks if haproxy is active and only then will it attempt to reload
it.
