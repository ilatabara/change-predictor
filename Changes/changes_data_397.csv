If the instance info_cache is corrupted somehow, like during
a host reboot and the ports aren't wired up properly or
a mistaken policy change in neutron results in nova resetting
the info_cache to an empty list, the _heal_instance_info_cache
is meant to fix it (once the current state of the ports for
the instance in neutron is corrected). However, the task is
currently only refreshing the cache *based* on the current contents
of the cache, which defeats the purpose of neutron being the source
of truth for the ports attached to the instance.

This change makes the _heal_instance_info_cache periodic task
pass a ""force_refresh"" kwarg, which defaults to False for backward
compatibility with other methods that refresh the cache after
operations like attach/detach interface, and if True will make
nova get the current state of the ports for the instance from neutron
and fully rebuild the info_cache.

To not lose port order in info_cache this change takes original order
from nova historical data that are stored as VirtualInterfaceList
objects. For ports that are not registered as VirtualInterfaces
objects it will add them at the end of port_order list. Due to this
for instances older than Newton another patch was introduced to fill
missing VirtualInterface objects in the DB [1].

Long-term we should be able to refactor some of the older refresh
code which leverages the cache to instead use the refresh_vif_id
kwarg so that we do targeted cache updates when we do things like
attach and detach ports, but that's a change for another day.

If anything fails and raises an exception during
confirm_resize, the migration status is stuck in
""confirming"" status even though the instance status
may be ""ERROR"".

This change adds the errors_out_migration decorator
to the confirm_resize method to make sure the migration
status is ""error"" if an error is raised.

In bug 1821594 it was the driver.confirm_migration
method that raised some exception, so a unit test is
added here which simulates a similar scenario.

This only partially closes the bug because we are still
leaking allocations on the source node resource provider
since _delete_allocation_after_move is not called. That
will be dealt with in a separate patch.

This leads to LP Bug #1823740 where memcached has the wrong IP address for nova-cloud-controller in iptables rules. The symptom is the command ""openstack availability zone"" list timing out and SYN_SENT connections on the nova-cloud-controller unit to the memcached unit. Mitigation: Because juju does not currently allow binding post-deployment (LP Bug #1796653) we have to (re-)deploy memcached with the correct binding. There are two approaches. The safest of which is to deploy a new set of memcached units either with their cache relationship bound to nova-cloud-controllers default space or their default space set to the same as nova-cloud-controllers. .. code:: bash juju deploy -n 2 cs:memcached --to lxd --bind ""cache=<NCC's DEFAULT SPACE>"" ncc-memcached or juju deploy -n 2 cs:memcached --to lxd --bind ""<NCC's DEFAULT SPACE>"" ncc-memcached The alternative is to remove the existing memcached application entirely and redeploy it using the same approach. .. code:: bash juju remove-application memcached juju deploy -n 2 cs:memcached --to lxd --bind ""cache=<NCC's DEFAULT SPACE>"" or juju deploy -n 2 cs:memcached --to lxd --bind ""<NCC's DEFAULT SPACE>"" https://bugs.launchpad.net/charm-nova-cloud-controller/+bug/1823740 https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1796653 ",,38,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================== Treat devices (including PCI) as generic resources ================================================== Placeholder (chicken) so I have a spec URL to put in the blueprint (egg). Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/example Introduction paragraph -- why are we doing anything? A single paragraph of prose that operators can understand. The title and this first paragraph should be used as the subject line and body of the commit message respectively. Some notes about the nova-spec and blueprint process: * Not all blueprints need a spec. For more information see http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/blueprints.html#specs * The aim of this document is first to define the problem we need to solve, and second agree the overall approach to solve that problem. * This is not intended to be extensive documentation for a new feature. For example, there is no need to specify the exact configuration changes, nor the exact details of any DB model changes. But you should still define that such changes are required, and be clear on how that will affect upgrades. * You should aim to get your spec approved before writing your code. While you are free to write prototypes and code before getting your spec approved, its possible that the outcome of the spec review process leads you towards a fundamentally different solution than you first envisaged. * But, API changes are held to a much higher level of scrutiny. As soon as an API change merges, we must assume it could be in production somewhere, and as such, we then need to support that API change forever. To avoid getting that wrong, we do want lots of details about API changes upfront. Some notes about using this template: * Your spec should be in ReSTructured text, like this template. * Please wrap text at 79 columns. * The filename in the git repository should match the launchpad URL, for example a URL of: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/awesome-thing should be named awesome-thing.rst * Please do not delete any of the sections in this template. If you have nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None * For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html * To test out your formatting, build the docs using tox and see the generated HTML file in doc/build/html/specs/<path_of_your_file> * If you would like to provide a diagram with your spec, ascii diagrams are required. http://asciiflow.com/ is a very nice tool to assist with making ascii diagrams. The reason for this is that the tool used to review specs is based purely on plain text. Plain text will allow review to proceed without having to look at additional files which can not be viewed in gerrit. It will also allow inline feedback on the diagram itself. * If your specification proposes any changes to the Nova REST API such as changing parameters which can be returned or accepted, or even the semantics of what happens when a client calls into the API, then you should add the APIImpact flag to the commit message. Specifications with the APIImpact flag can be found with the following query: https://review.openstack.org/#/q/status:open+project:openstack/nova-specs+message:apiimpact,n,z Problem description =================== A detailed description of the problem. What problem is this blueprint addressing? Use Cases --------- What use cases does this address? What impact on actors does this change have? Ensure you are clear about the actors in each use case: Developer, End User, Deployer etc. Proposed change =============== Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How do you propose to solve this problem? If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In other words, what's the scope of this effort? At this point, if you would like to just get feedback on if the problem and proposed change fit in nova, you can stop here and post this for review to get preliminary feedback. If so please say: Posting to get preliminary feedback on the scope of this spec. Alternatives ------------ What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one. Data model impact ----------------- Changes which require modifications to the data model often have a wider impact on the system. The community often has strong opinions on how the data model should be evolved, from both a functional and performance perspective. It is therefore important to capture and gain agreement as early as possible on any proposed changes to the data model. Questions which need to be addressed by this section include: * What new data objects and/or database schema changes is this going to require? * What database migrations will accompany this change. * How will the initial set of new data objects be generated, for example if you need to take into account existing instances, or modify other existing data describe how that will work. REST API impact --------------- Each API method which is either added or changed should have the following * Specification for the method * A description of what the method does suitable for use in user documentation * Method type (POST/PUT/GET/DELETE) * Normal http response code(s) * Expected error http response code(s) * A description for each possible error code should be included describing semantic errors which can cause it such as inconsistent parameters supplied to the method, or when an instance is not in an appropriate state for the request to succeed. Errors caused by syntactic problems covered by the JSON schema definition do not need to be included. * URL for the resource * URL should not include underscores, and use hyphens instead. * Parameters which can be passed via the url * JSON schema definition for the request body data if allowed * Field names should use snake_case style, not CamelCase or MixedCase style. * JSON schema definition for the response body data if any * Field names should use snake_case style, not CamelCase or MixedCase style. * Example use case including typical API samples for both data supplied by the caller and the response * Discuss any policy changes, and discuss what things a deployer needs to think about when defining their policy. Example JSON schema definitions can be found in the Nova tree http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/nova/api/openstack/compute/schemas Note that the schema should be defined as restrictively as possible. Parameters which are required should be marked as such and only under exceptional circumstances should additional parameters which are not defined in the schema be permitted (eg additionaProperties should be False). Reuse of existing predefined parameter types such as regexps for passwords and user defined names is highly encouraged. Security impact --------------- Describe any potential security impact on the system. Some of the items to consider include: * Does this change touch sensitive data such as tokens, keys, or user data? * Does this change alter the API in a way that may impact security, such as a new way to access sensitive information or a new way to login? * Does this change involve cryptography or hashing? * Does this change require the use of sudo or any elevated privileges? * Does this change involve using or parsing user-provided data? This could be directly at the API level or indirectly such as changes to a cache layer. * Can this change enable a resource exhaustion attack, such as allowing a single API interaction to consume significant server resources? Some examples of this include launching subprocesses for each connection, or entity expansion attacks in XML. For more detailed guidance, please see the OpenStack Security Guidelines as a reference (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/Guidelines). These guidelines are a work in progress and are designed to help you identify security best practices. For further information, feel free to reach out to the OpenStack Security Group at openstack-security@lists.openstack.org. Notifications impact -------------------- Please specify any changes to notifications. Be that an extra notification, changes to an existing notification, or removing a notification. Other end user impact --------------------- Aside from the API, are there other ways a user will interact with this feature? * Does this change have an impact on python-novaclient? What does the user interface there look like? Performance Impact ------------------ Describe any potential performance impact on the system, for example how often will new code be called, and is there a major change to the calling pattern of existing code. Examples of things to consider here include: * A periodic task might look like a small addition but if it calls conductor or another service the load is multiplied by the number of nodes in the system. * Scheduler filters get called once per host for every instance being created, so any latency they introduce is linear with the size of the system. * A small change in a utility function or a commonly used decorator can have a large impacts on performance. * Calls which result in a database queries (whether direct or via conductor) can have a profound impact on performance when called in critical sections of the code. * Will the change include any locking, and if so what considerations are there on holding the lock? Other deployer impact --------------------- Discuss things that will affect how you deploy and configure OpenStack that have not already been mentioned, such as: * What config options are being added? Should they be more generic than proposed (for example a flag that other hypervisor drivers might want to implement as well)? Are the default values ones which will work well in real deployments? * Is this a change that takes immediate effect after its merged, or is it something that has to be explicitly enabled? * If this change is a new binary, how would it be deployed? * Please state anything that those doing continuous deployment, or those upgrading from the previous release, need to be aware of. Also describe any plans to deprecate configuration values or features. For example, if we change the directory name that instances are stored in, how do we handle instance directories created before the change landed? Do we move them? Do we have a special case in the code? Do we assume that the operator will recreate all the instances in their cloud? Developer impact ---------------- Discuss things that will affect other developers working on OpenStack, such as: * If the blueprint proposes a change to the driver API, discussion of how other hypervisors would implement the feature is required. Upgrade impact -------------- Describe any potential upgrade impact on the system, such as: * If this change adds a new feature to the compute host that the controller services rely on, the controller services may need to check the minimum compute service version in the deployment before using the new feature. For example, in Ocata, the FilterScheduler did not use the Placement API until all compute services were upgraded to at least Ocata. * While we strive to have feature parity between all virt drivers, it is not uncommon for one virt driver to implement a new feature exposed out of the API before the others. For example, extending the size of an attached volume. Since Nova does not yet have any type of sophisticated *capabilities* API so a user can know what actions can be performed on a given instance, consider adding a new policy rule to at least let operators that cannot support a virt-specific feature disable it in their cloud which is at least presented to the user in an understandable way by getting a ``403 Forbidden`` error. * Nova supports N-1 version *nova-compute* services for rolling upgrades. Does the proposed change need to consider older code running that may impact how the new change functions, for example, by changing or overwriting global state in the database? This is generally most problematic when making changes that involve multiple compute hosts, like move operations such as migrate, resize, unshelve and evacuate. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: <launchpad-id or None> Other contributors: <launchpad-id or None> Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Dependencies ============ * Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in nova, or in other projects, that this one either depends on or is related to. * If this requires functionality of another project that is not currently used by Nova (such as the glance v2 API when we previously only required v1), document that fact. * Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not included in OpenStack? Or does it depend on a specific version of library? Testing ======= Please discuss the important scenarios needed to test here, as well as specific edge cases we should be ensuring work correctly. For each scenario please specify if this requires specialized hardware, a full openstack environment, or can be simulated inside the Nova tree. Please discuss how the change will be tested. We especially want to know what tempest tests will be added. It is assumed that unit test coverage will be added so that doesn't need to be mentioned explicitly, but discussion of why you think unit tests are sufficient and we don't need to add more tempest tests would need to be included. Is this untestable in gate given current limitations (specific hardware / software configurations available)? If so, are there mitigation plans (3rd party testing, gate enhancements, etc). Documentation Impact ==================== Which audiences are affected most by this change, and which documentation titles on docs.openstack.org should be updated because of this change? Don't repeat details discussed above, but reference them here in the context of documentation for multiple audiences. For example, the Operations Guide targets cloud operators, and the End User Guide would need to be updated if the change offers a new feature available through the CLI or dashboard. If a config option changes or is deprecated, note here that the documentation needs to be updated to reflect this specification's change. References ========== Other blueprints around the same topic: * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/usb-passthrough * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/usb-passthrough-with-usb-controller Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any reference. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are: * Links to mailing list or IRC discussions * Links to notes from a summit session * Links to relevant research, if appropriate * Related specifications as appropriate (e.g. if it's an EC2 thing, link the EC2 docs) * Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to History ======= Optional section intended to be used each time the spec is updated to describe new design, API or any database schema updated.

As the comment in the code suggests, when calling migrate_instance_finish
in finish_revert_resize we need to temporarily set the migration
object dest_compute to the source_compute since we are moving port
bindings from the dest back to the source. However, this is not
really a temporary change to the object if something fails after
this because the @errors_out_migration decorator will persist the
change which could be confusing later if trying to debug this migration
from the API and the dest_compute and source_compute have the same value.

This fixes the issue by using the temporary_mutation utility.

Also, the obj_to_primitive dance in here is removed since it is not
necessary as migrate_instance_finish handles a Migration object.

NOTE(mriedem): The conflict is due to not having change

When EventletEvent.clear() is called twice in succession without an
intervening set(), there's no need to replace the underlying
eventlet.event.Event object, since it has never been sent. Doing so
would have woken other greenthreads waiting on the event to no
particular end.

When clear() is called after the event has been set(), we already did
not do anything special with the existing eventlet.event.Event as we
cannot call send() on it twice. We simply replace it with a new one; the

HA routers are using keepalived and needs to have virtual_router_id
configured. As routers which belongs to same tenant are using same
ha network, those values have to be different for each router.

Before this patch this value was always taken as first available value
from available_vr_ids range.
In some (rare) cases, when more than one router is created in parallel
for same tenant it may happen that those routers would have same vr_id
choosen so keepalived would treat them as single application and only
one router would be ACTIVE on one of L3 agents.

This patch changes this behaviour that now random value from available
vr_ids will be chosen instead of taking first value always.
That should mittigate this rare race condition that it will be (almost)
not noticable for users.

However, proper fix should be probably done as some additional
constraint in database layer. But such solution wouldn't be possible to
backport to stable branches so I decided to propose this easy patch
first.

When deploying osd, if the user does not use the extra block
partition, the kolla will automatically partition the disk and then
clean up the data on the disk partition. Sometimes the disk partition
will not be updated, there will be an error not finding the partition.

This commit fixes the problem.

In some edge cases, when a request comes in to update a child
resource (member, HM, or l7rule), the API would not always make
sure the parent object (pool or l7policy) was in a mutable status.

This patch fixes this by checking the parent provisioning_status
before allowing a muttable change on a child object.

It also resolves two cases where a parent object status was not being
reset on a reverted flow.

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect

will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when
the requirements repository branches.

Until the requirements repository has as stable/stein branch, tests will
continue to use the upper-constraints list on master.

If ovs was restarted, and an error happens when resetting bridges /
tunnels / flows, the agent crashes and exits. To avoid that, we
make the agent catch all errors and gracefully ignore them (after
logging details), in hope that the next iteration will be more
successful.

Since we set up canary flows before the rest of _handle_ovs_restart
body, it's possible to receive an error after the flows are set on
bridges. In this case, the next iteration will return OVS_NORMAL from
check_canary_table(). We should handle this situation by forcing full
recovery after OVS restart. This is achieved by introducing the
``recover_needed`` boolean flag that serves as a sticky indication that
an OVS restart happened in the past that we haven't fully recovered
from.

We use neutron objects for
1) RPC between neutron components
2) passing them between functions across modules
3) converting the DB columns to dict and serialize

But for small queries which need only few columns from tables
(without joining other tables), directly querying the databse
will improve the performance.

When there are both IPv4 and IPv6 subnets on the public
network, the port that a floating IP allocates there gets
assigned addresses from both subnets.

Allocating an IPv6 address should be avoided for
neutron floating ip if those plugins not support
associating IPv6 floating IPs to IPv4 fixed IPs.

A router:external network can have floating IPs while an internal
network cannot. But so far the update of a network's router:external
attribute from True to False was allowed and the floating IPs kept
existing - creating an invalid state of objects.

The original discussion in the bug report suggested prohibiting the
network update in such conditions. But I discovered that a similar
operation (deleting an external net with floating IPs) was allowed
and the invalid state was resolved by automatically deleting the
corresponding floating IPs.

For the sake of consistent API behavior this change does the same for
the network update turning the net to internal.

As discussed in review a change like this in API behavior needs to be
discoverable by an API extension. Therefore this change also introduces
a shim extension: floatingip-autodelete-internal.

APIImpact: New extension: floatingip-autodelete-internal.

!! This is a PoC only.

In Bionic the nf_conntrack_helper is disabled by default.
This is good security practice, but causes issues for
Ironic CI which need conntrack for TFTP traffic.

The solution seem to be to add firewall rules to the
router namespace to explicitly enable the tftp helper
for the specific port. Example:

 -A PREROUTING -p udp -m udp --dport 69 -j CT --helper tftp

This change adds a config option in l3_agent which allow
specifying a list of dics such as:
  {helper: tftp, proto: udp, port: 69}

The data is then used to apply the firewall rules in the
namespace when it is created.

Today we have neutron_lib._policy that is 1/2 baked, out of sync and was
never consumed.

This patch updates neutron_lib's policy with the latest from neutron
with the following changes:
- Removed TODO about API attribute typing; we have that IIUC.
- Removed NOTE about _extract() relying on core plugin; we now have the
plugin directory in neutron-lib which IIUC solves this NOTE.
- Removed the 'plugin' kwarg from enforce() and check(). This kwarg is
deprecated and not used by the functions. Now is the time to clean it
up.

In addition neutron.common.cache_utils is rehomed as
neutron_lib.utils.cache. While not used outside neutron today [1], it's
needed by policy and generic in nature.

As part of adding API definitions to neutron-lib, we want to reuse the
generic validators as much as possible. However as part of this reuse
we shouldn't impact the ability of an API to provide more meaningful
validation error messages that ultimately may ease the API user
experience. Moreover some API's need to customize the HTTP code returned
on validation failure [1].

Today we don't provide a way to customize the generic validator
exceptions/messages, so API's who need more specific error messages
(ex: [1][2]) only have the option to create 1-off validators for
their specific exceptions/messages.

This patch proposes that we allow APIs to customize this exception
class/message by having validators encapsulate their validation
failure data into an object that can then be used by a custom
exception. In addition a basic set of objects are provided to
implement the notion of validation results, options, etc.

Existing style validators that just return a string will still work,
but will be limited in terms of how useful they are for customized
exceptions. To that end this patch updates all lib's validators to use
the new style objects and clarifies that validators should not raise
exceptions unless they are programmatic in nature.

Refactor ping connectivity verification on top of a reusable
ping command wrapper.

Write a new function called ping.get_statistics able of executing
ping command in either a remote host or on local host
and parsing actual ping command output to report ping statistis.

Additional mixin test case mixin class is provided to allow sending
ping message until some specific condition are met:
 - a 'count' of messages is transmitted
 - a 'count' of messages is delivered (transmitted without errors)
 - a 'count' of messages is not delivered (transmitted with errors)
 - a 'count' of messages is received
 - a 'count' of messages is not received (transmitted but not received)

Some new configuration options has been added to tune default
parameters passed to ping command.

Some logic has been added to support CirrOS CLI differences from
regular Unix shells.

This tool allows to make far more precise verifications regarding
ICMP connectivity by reporting more result details than just reporting
success or failure.

v1 manifests store the layer digests in a different way, which the
prepare code has conditional logic to handle, however this is missing
from image copy when discovering source layer digests.

There is also a v1 manifest format error in the image export delete code.

This change fixes both of these issues, which should make it possible
to copy images from quay.io.

This updates the 'overcloud container image prepare' command
so that it sets the neutron_driver variable correctly. This
allows tripleo-common to detect if OVN or ODL drivers are in

The purpose of this document is to propose a design for how we can use OVN as the backend for OpenStack's LoadBalancer API provided by Octavia. Octavia LoadBalancers Today ---------------------------- A Detailed design analysis of Octavia can be found here: https://docs.openstack.org/octavia/queens/contributor/design/version0.5/component-design.html Currently, Octavia uses the in-built Amphorae driver to fulfill the Loadbalancing requests in Openstack. Amphoare can be a Virtual machine, container, dedicated hardware, appliance or device that actually performs the task of load balancing in the Octavia system. More specifically, an amphora takes requests from clients on the front-end and distributes these to back-end systems. Amphorae communicate with their controllers over the LB Network through a driver interface on the controller. The issue here is that Amphorae needs a placeholder, for eg a separate VM/Container etc to be deployed so that it can handle the LB requests. Along with this, it also needs a separate network( termed as lb-mgmt-network ) which handles all Amphorae requests. Amphorae has the capability to handle L4(TCP/UDP) as well as L7(HTTP) LoadBalancer requests. It also has the capability of being monitored and thus helps in fixing if something is broken. Octavia with OVN ----------------------------- OVN currently doesnt support L7 protocols, but it does support L4 protocols. Also, currently it does not have any facility to be monitored. However, it does not need any extra hadrware/VM/Container to be deployed, which is a major positive point when compared with Amphorae. Also, it does not require any special network to handle the LB requests as they are taken care by OpenFlows directly. Also, though OVN does not have support for TLS, it is in the works and once implemented can be integrated with Octavia This following section details about how OVN can be used as an Octavia driver. Overview of Proposed Approach ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The OVN Driver for Octavia runs under the scope of o-api. Octavia API receives and forwards calls to the OVN Driver. As mentioned above, following actions are not supported by OVN Driver: - Creating a LoadBalancer/Listener/Pool with L7 Protocol support - Creating HealthMonitors **Step 1** - Creating a LoadBalancer Octavia API recieves and issues a LoadBalancer creation request on a network to the OVN Provider driver. OVN driver creates a LoadBalancer in the OVN NorthBound DB and asynchronously updates the Octavia Database with the status response. A VIP port is created in Neutron when the LoadBalancer creation is complete. The VIP information however is not updated in the NorthBound DB until the Members are not associated with the LoadBalancer's Pool. **Step 2** - Creating LoadBalancer entities( Pools, Listeners, Members) Once a LoadBalancer is created by OVN in its NorthBound DB, Users can now create Pools, Listeners and Members associated with the LoadBalancer using the Octavia API. With the creation of each entity the LoadBalancer's external_ids column in the NorthBound DB would be updated and corresponding Logical and Openflows would be added for handling them. **Step 3** - LoadBalancer request processing When a user sends a request to the VIP IP address, the Logical Flow in OVN's SouthBound DB is verified. Once the correspoinding Logical Flow is found in the DB, the packet is forwarded using OVN's tunnelling mechanism from the VIP to any one of the members. Member selection is based on the Pool's LoadBalancing Algorithm. Once the appropriate Member is selected by Octavia, the corresponding flow is used to direct the traffic from the VIP to the associated Member. OVN LoadBalancer Driver Logic ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * On startup: * Do a full sync. * Open and maintain a connection to the OVN Northbound database (using the ovsdbapp library). On first connection, and anytime a reconnect happens: * Do a full sync. * Register a callback when a new interface is added to a router or deleted from a router. * When a new LoadBalancer L1 is created, create a Row in OVN's *load_balancer* table, and update its entries for Name and Network References. If the network on which the LoadBalancer is created is associated with a Router, say R1, then add the router reference to the LoadBalancer and associate the LoadBalancer to the router. For all networks which have an interface on the router R1, associate the LoadBalancer L1 with all the networks. This is required so that Logical Flows for inter-network communication while using the LoadBalancer L1 is possible. Also, during this time, a new port is created via Neutron which acts as a VIP Port. The information of this new port is not visible on the OVN's NorthBound DB till a member is not added to the LoadBalancer. * If a new network interface is added to the router R1 described above, all the Loadbalancers on that network are associated with the Router R1 and all the LoadBalancers on the Router are associated with the new network. * If a network interface is removed from the router R1, then all the LoadBalancers which have been solely created on that Network(identified using the *ls_ref* attribute in the LoadBalancer's *external_ids*) are removed from the Router. Similarly those loadbalancers which are associated with the network but not actually created on that network are removed from the network. * LoadBalancer can either be torn-down with all its children entities using the *cascade* option, or the individual members/pools/listeners can be deleted. When the LoadBalancer is deleted, all its references and associations from all networks and routers are removed. This might change in the future once the association of LoadBalancers with Networks/Routers are changed to *weak* from *strong* [3]. Also the VIP port is deleted when the LoadBalancer is deleted.

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect

Until the requirements repository has as stable/stein branch, tests will

When we're in ""--check"" mode with Ansible, the variable is defined,
but its content doesn't match the one we might get when actually applying
the run.
The right way to detect that is to check if the variable is changed.

In ""--check"", it is not changed, meaning we can't get the ""rc"" attribute.

I5851dc7820fdcc4f5790980d94b81622ce3b0c8d didn't do the right check, and
does not improve the situation.

Now that policy rules can be registered in code there is a desire to run
projects without a policy file. However oslo.policy assumed a policy
file would exist and would raise an error if it could not be found. This
was fixed by https://review.openstack.org/#/c/341732/

After this fix it became noticible that Enforcer class
not only enforces but also stores rules. And this should be changed.
Enforcing and storing shoud be separated.

These changes make Enforcer logic more simple.
And Enforcer can be extendend or improved without adding
more flags.
Everything related to file was moved to FileRulesCache class.
It is easy to read code or debug.
This refactoring shouldn't break anything in projects
because Enforcer API was not changed.

Enabling tls-proxy allows devstack to
set up a tls proxy server that front-ends
interactions with the manila-api and
terminates tls connections.

Also enable tls-proxy in dummy and lvm
jobs. The dummy driver job is configured
to run the in-built wsgi server, the lvm
job is configured to use mod-wsgi.

When we're in ""--check"" mode with Ansible, the variable is defined,
but its content doesn't match the one we might get when actually applying
the run.
The right way to detect that is to check if the variable is changed.

In ""--check"", it is not changed, meaning we can't get the ""rc"" attribute.

As a protection against policy mistakes as we begin a refactor add a
flag to each request keystone receives that indicates whether or not a
policy enforcement check has been completed for that request. Requests
that don't require policy enforcement will simply accept the flag.

Any request that tries to return a success response that has not had
policy enforced on it should return a 500 error as this is a server side
bug as somehow a request has managed to skip our RBAC protection.

We have jsonschema capped at a fairly old version. Other than some
specific releases, it looks like keeping it below 3.0 was added in
I943fd68b9fab3bce1764305a5058df5339470757 without really any explanation
why.

In order to update to a 3.x release we need to:
1. Remove the cap from global-requirements.txt (see Depends-On), leaving
   upper-constraints.txt at a 2.x release
2. Remove the cap from all consumers (this change)
3. Release a new version of consumers that are published to pypi

Without this change, when an admin tries to delete an LDAP-backed

Previously, we were assuming that LDAP users existed solely in the LDAP

Fixed functional test test_flavor_traits_based_scheduling as it
would pass 50% of the times even if the required trait was not
taken into account by adding a new part that disables the compute
host that has the required trait and retries, expecting a no valid
host error.

Added functional test test_flavor_forbidden_traits_based_scheduling

The second test temporarily passes where it should not until the
next commit where the bug is actually fixed.

This patch implements the spec [1] on enable backend async
migration, to be clear, this one only consists modification
related to cinder framework.

[1] 5758603751eef6562d6c2bad2fb3befe428d0c5a

Logic detail:

* If source backend driver's migrate_volume() returns 'moved' as
  False, call target backend driver's migrate_volume_target()
  through rpcapi. Give a chance for target backend to perform
  the migration.

* If migrate_volume_target() returns 'moved' as False which means
  driver can't perform the migration on the target backend, we will
  go to _migrate_volume_generic() as usual to perform host-copy
  migration.

* If migrate_volume_target() return 'moved' as True and
  'migration_async' as False, change the 'migration_status' to
  'success' and update the volume in db.

* If migrate_volume_target() return 'moved' as True and
  'migration_async' as True, change the 'migration_status' to
  'migrating_attachable' which means this volume is migrating and
  is safe to attach it to a server.

* If 'migration_async' is True, call target backend driver's
  complete_migration_target() to wait the migration really complete,
  and update the 'migration_status' to 'success'.

Currently, OVN Gate fails due to different reasons which include:

a) certain tests in Neutron's ML2 Plugin
which check for support of updating Segmentation ID on live provider
networks. Since the same functionality is not present in OVNMechanism
Driver for now, the test need to be skipped to allow the gate to be
functional.

b) networking-ovn-tripleo-c7-s003-oooq-containers job is made
non-voting for the check jobs and commented out in the gate jobs,
because of the existing bug in TripleO:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1824326

c)This patch removes psycopg2 and postgres since its not required
for functional testing by networking-ovn.

Without this change, when an admin tries to delete an LDAP-backed
domain, it fails due to the foreign key relationship in the users table.
Previously, we were assuming that LDAP users existed solely in the LDAP
directory, but this is not true with shadow users. This patch fixes the
logic to delete the shadow users upon domain deletion.

HA routers are using keepalived and needs to have virtual_router_id
configured. As routers which belongs to same tenant are using same
ha network, those values have to be different for each router.

Before this patch this value was always taken as first available value
from available_vr_ids range.
In some (rare) cases, when more than one router is created in parallel
for same tenant it may happen that those routers would have same vr_id
choosen so keepalived would treat them as single application and only
one router would be ACTIVE on one of L3 agents.

This patch changes this behaviour that now random value from available
vr_ids will be chosen instead of taking first value always.
That should mittigate this rare race condition that it will be (almost)
not noticable for users.

However, proper fix should be probably done as some additional
constraint in database layer. But such solution wouldn't be possible to
backport to stable branches so I decided to propose this easy patch
first.

We enable that only for standalone and undercloud jobs for now.

possible false-positives without breaking the whole CI.

This will allow to enable that new validation only for the non-voting

Doing it at that higher level is better than editing the featuresets,
since one set can be used in both voting and non-voting jobs.

This is a temporary activation, since we need to gather non-blocking
information about that new validation.

The following 2 scenarios could result in an instance with incorrect
port binding and cause subsequent rebuilds to fail.

If an evacuation of an instance fails part way through, after the point
where we reassign the port binding to the new host but before we change
the instance host, we end up with the ports assigned to the wrong host.
This change adds a check to determine if there's any port binding host
mismatches and if so trigger setup of instance network.

During recovery of failed hosts, neutron could get overwhelmed and lose
messages, for example when active controller was powered-off in the
middle of instance evacuations. In this case the vif_type was set to
'binding_failed' or 'unbound'. We subsequently hit ""Unsupported VIF
type"" exception during instance hard_reboot or rebuild, leaving the
instance unrecoverable.

This commit changes _heal_instance_info_cache periodic task to update
port binding if evacuation fails due to above errors so that the
instance can be recovered later.

We had no unit test coverage for the console-log command
so this adds a simple test. It unfortunately does not
recreate the original UnicodeEncodeError bug though, but
it gives us some test coverage anyway.

This change also adds docs on how to resolve bug 1746534

This reverts commit d272d6f3df2610a62f81e2ca26798ea8a6674b06. This
worked around a misconfigured environment by forcing stdout to use
UTF-8. This is kind of a hack and it only works in Python 2, breaking
Python 3 [1].

The correct solution to this issue and all Python 2 unicode print issues
is to correctly configuring LC_ALL to use a UTF-8 locale.

Kolla supports container customization and we are making use of this feature within TripleO to inject puppet (our configuration tool of choice) into the Kolla base images. A variety of other customizations are being made via the tripleo-common/container-images/tripleo_kolla_template_overrides.j2 file. To build Kolla images for TripleO adjust your kolla config [*]_ to build your centos base image with puppet using the example below: .. code-block:: $ cat template-overrides.j2 {% extends parent_template %} {% set base_centos_binary_packages_append = ['puppet'] %} {% set nova_scheduler_packages_append = ['openstack-tripleo-common'] %} kolla-build --base centos --template-override template-overrides.j2 .. .. [*] See the `override file <https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-common/blob/master/container-images/tripleo_kolla_template_overrides.j2>`_ which can be used to build Kolla packages that work with TripleO. Containerized Deployment Template Structure ------------------------------------------- Each deployment template may define a set of output values control the underlying service deployment in a variety of ways. These output sections are specific to the TripleO deployment architecture. The following sections are available for containerized services. * config_settings: This section contains service specific hiera data can be used to generate config files for each service. This data is ultimately processed via the container-puppet.py tool which generates config files for each service according to the settings here. * kolla_config: Contains YAML that represents how to map config files into the kolla container. This config file is typically mapped into the container itself at the /var/lib/kolla/config_files/config.json location and drives how kolla's external config mechanisms work. * docker_config: Data that is passed to paunch tool to configure a container, or step of containers at each step. See the available steps documented below which are implemented by TripleO's cluster deployment architecture. * puppet_config: This section is a nested set of key value pairs that drive the creation of config files using puppet. Required parameters include: * puppet_tags: Puppet resource tag names that are used to generate config files with puppet. Only the named config resources are used to generate a config file. Any service that specifies tags will have the default tags of 'file,concat,file_line,augeas,cron' appended to the setting. Example: keystone_config * config_volume: The name of the volume (directory) where config files will be generated for this service. Use this as the location to bind mount into the running Kolla container for configuration. * config_image: The name of the container image that will be used for generating configuration files. This is often the same container that the runtime service uses. Some services share a common set of config files which are generated in a common base container. * step_config: This setting controls the manifest that is used to create container config files via puppet. The puppet tags below are used along with this manifest to generate a config directory for this container. * container_puppet_tasks: This section provides data to drive the container-puppet.py tool directly. The task is executed only once within the cluster (not on each node) and is useful for several puppet snippets we require for initialization of things like keystone endpoints, database users, etc. See container-puppet.py for formatting. Deployment steps ---------------- Similar to baremetal containers are brought up in a stepwise manner. The current architecture supports bringing up baremetal services alongside of containers. For each step the baremetal puppet manifests are executed first and then any containers are brought up afterwards. Steps correlate to the following: Pre) Containers config files generated per hiera settings. 1) Load Balancer configuration baremetal a) step 1 baremetal b) step 1 containers 2) Core Services (Database/Rabbit/NTP/etc.) a) step 2 baremetal b) step 2 containers 3) Early Openstack Service setup (Ringbuilder, etc.) a) step 3 baremetal b) step 3 containers 4) General OpenStack Services a) step 4 baremetal b) step 4 containers c) Keystone containers post initialization (tenant,service,endpoint creation) 5) Service activation (Pacemaker), online data migration a) step 5 baremetal b) step 5 containers Update steps: ------------- All services have an associated update_tasks output that is an ansible snippet that will be run during update in an rolling update that is expected to run in a rolling update fashion (one node at a time) For Controller (where pacemaker is running) we have the following states: 1. Step=1: stop the cluster on the updated node; 2. Step=2: Pull the latest image and retag the it pcmklatest 3. Step=3: yum upgrade happens on the host. 4. Step=4: Restart the cluster on the node 5. Step=5: Verification: Currently we test that the pacemaker services are running. Then the usual deploy steps are run which pull in the latest image for all containerized services and the updated configuration if any. Note: as pacemaker is not containerized, the points 1 and 4 happen in puppet/services/pacemaker.yaml. Fast-forward Upgrade Steps -------------------------- Each service template may optionally define a `fast_forward_upgrade_tasks` key, which is a list of Ansible tasks to be performed during the fast-forward upgrade process. As with Upgrade steps each task is associated to a particular step provided as a variable and used along with a release variable by a basic conditional that determines when the task should run. Steps are broken down into two categories, prep tasks executed across all hosts and bootstrap tasks executed on a single host for a given role. The individual steps then correspond to the following tasks during the upgrade: Prep steps: - Step=0: Check running services - Step=1: Stop the service - Step=2: Stop the cluster - Step=3: Update repos Bootstrap steps: - Step=4: DB backups - Step=5: Pre package update commands - Step=6: Package updates - Step=7: Post package update commands - Step=8: DB syncs - Step=9: Verification",,159,179

It is generally recommended to use a virtual environment to install Kolla Ansible and its dependencies, to avoid conflicts with the system site packages. Note that this is independent from the use of a virtual environment for remote execution, which is described :ref:`here <virtual-environments-target-hosts>`. #. For CentOS, install EPEL. .. code-block:: console sudo yum install epel-release #. For Ubuntu, update the package index. .. code-block:: console sudo apt-get update #.

Install the virtualenv package. For CentOS or RHEL, run: sudo yum install python-virtualenv sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv #. Create a virtual environment and activate it: virtualenv /path/to/virtualenv source /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate The virtual environment should be activated before running any commands that depend on packages installed in it. #. Ensure the latest version of pip is installed: pip install -U pip #. Install `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com>`__. Currently, Kolla Ansible requires Ansible 2.4+. pip install ansible Install dependencies not using a virtual environment ---------------------------------------------------- If installing Kolla Ansible in a virtual environment, skip this section. #. Install ``pip``. For CentOS or RHEL, run: .. code-block:: console sudo yum install python-pip For Ubuntu, run: .. code-block:: console sudo apt-get install python-pip #.

This is covered :ref:`here <virtual-environments-target-hosts>`. The following assumes the use of the ``multinode`` inventory.

Currently, CentOS and RHEL package Ansible >=2.4 which is suitable for use with Kolla. Note that you will need to enable access to the EPEL repository to install via :command:`yum` to do so, take a look at `Fedora's EPEL docs <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`__ and `FAQ <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ>`__. For CentOS or RHEL, this can be done using: yum install ansible For Ubuntu, it can be installed by: apt-get install ansible #.

To move ironicclient legacy jobs to zuulv3 the the following changes
were necessary:

- Change `tox.ini` to pass envrioment variables
- Clean `post_test_hook.sh` to avoid legacy variables (`$USER` and
`$BASE`), removing `generate_testr_results` function since we only
get `testrepository.subunit` in logs and the results of the tests
are present in job-output file.

Without this change, when an admin tries to delete an LDAP-backed
domain, it fails due to the foreign key relationship in the users table.
Previously, we were assuming that LDAP users existed solely in the LDAP
directory, but this is not true with shadow users. This patch fixes the
logic to delete the shadow users upon domain deletion.

Altered cherry-pick: use injected API provider since provider_api
mechanism doesn't exist in pike.

For example, it could be incorrect based on the type of block device being requested. Another issue is the device could already be used on the guest which leads to collisions. In general, it is just not something we can honor on the backend compute driver / hypervisor layer and is better to remove it from the API. In fact, the Libvirt compute driver stopped honoring the user-supplied device name altogether in the 12.0.0 Liberty release [1]_. Use Cases --------- As a user, I want to boot a server from a backing volume and trust the compute service to attach the volume correctly. As a user, I want to attach an existing volume to an existing server, which may or may not already have other attached volumes, and trust the compute service to attach the volume correctly. Proposed change =============== The propose change is very simple. In a microversion, we remove ``block_device_mapping.device_name`` (v1) and ``block_device_mapping_v2.device_name`` from the ``POST /servers`` (create) API and ``device`` from the ``POST /servers/{server_id}/os-volume_attachments`` (attach volume) API. We just need to remove them from the json schema request validation for accepted parameters. After that microversion, providing a device in those requests will result in a ``400 Bad Request`` error response. For users that are using the device name to try and identify the devices after they are attached, they can use device tags now, introduced in microversion 2.32 for server create [2]_. The 2.32 microversion did not support tagging a block device when attaching a volume to a server. That is being added in `blueprint virt-device-tagged-attach-detach`_ so this change depends on that blueprint being implemented first. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- **POST /servers** * Request The json schema request body validation for the server create API will change in a microversion: * The ``block_device_mapping.device_name`` entry will be removed for v1 BDMs. * The ``block_device_mapping_v2.device_name`` entry will be removed for v2 BDMs. * Response The server create API reponse does not return volume attachments in the response anyway so nothing will change here. **POST /servers/{server_id}/os-volume_attachments** * Request The json schema request body validation for the volume attach API will change in a microversion: * The ``device`` entry will be removed. * Response When attaching a volume, it is an asynchronous operation and the device name is decided on the compute. Today for an instance that is not shelved-offloaded, the API issues an RPC call to the compute hosting the instance to ""reserve"" a device name and returns that in the response. This is racy though and the actual device mountpoint that the volume gets attached to may not be the same. For shelved-offloaded instances, None is returned for the device in the POST response when attaching a volume because the instance does not have a host associated so the RPC call cannot be performed. Therefore, this spec proposes to remove the ``device`` field from the volume attach response. Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- Notifications sent during server create start and volume attach start may not include a device name after this change. The server create end and volume attach end notifications, however, should include the device name as before. Other end user impact --------------------- python-novaclient will need to be updated to no longer accept a block device name in ``boot`` and ``volume-attach`` operations for the new microversion. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Matt Riedemann (mriedem) Work Items ---------- * Adjust the server create and volume attach json schema validation to remove the optional block device name field. * Adjust the volume attach POST response body to remove the device field. * Update python-novaclient for the new microversion. Dependencies ============ The `blueprint virt-device-tagged-attach-detach`_ will need to be implemented before this for tagging block devices during volume attach operations. Testing ======= * Unit and functional tests as normal. * Tempest response schema validation will need to be updated for the volume attach response which will no longer include the ``device`` field after the microversion [3]_. Documentation Impact ==================== The compute API reference documentation will need to be updated. The novaclient CLI documentation will need to be updated. References ========== ..

When we shelve offload an instance, we unplug VIFs, delete
the guest from the compute host, etc. The instance is still
logically attached to its ports but they aren't connected
on any host.

When we unshelve an instance, it is scheduled and created
on a potentially new host, in a potentially new availability
zone. During unshelve, the compute manager will call the
setup_instance_network_on_host() method to update the port
host binding information for the new host, but was not
updating the device_owner, which reflects the availability
zone that the instance is in. Because of this, an instance
can be created in az1, shelved, and then unshelved in az2
but the port device_owner still says az1 even though the
port host binding is for a compute host in az2.

This change simply updates the port device_owner when
updating the port binding host during unshelve.

A TODO is left in the cleanup_instance_network_on_host()
method which is called during shelve offload but is currently
not implemented. We should unbind ports when shelve offloading,
but that is a bit of a bigger change and left for a separate
patch since it is not technically needed for this bug fix.

Our policy is to use the version of Python that comes packaged with the
LTS versions of distros at the start of development cycles. This hasn't
always been clear to projects, and in general we haven't done a great
job of making sure the correct tests are being run.

This adds job templates with the required python versioned jobs for each
cycle to make it explicit. We are a little late in Stein, but projects
may choose to pick up the use of the Stein template yet to make
branching easier.

We have some automation in place when creating stable branches. We will
look into automating the switch over to the Train required jobs when we
cut the stable/stein branches.

Using a scsi decorated image with:
hw_disk_bus='scsi'
hw_scsi_model='virtio-scsi'

This solve the case where an instance is
launched with 'image' selected as boot
source with a new volume. This will result
in /dev/vda instead of /dev/sda as it
should.

Not specifying device name in
setFinalSpecBootImageToVolume() leaves the
decision to nova to determine it.

Example:
-------
VM boot volume without scsi meta data decoration:
Attached To
0a0cd660-7ce3-4033-9983-2e1099edc5f0 on /dev/vda

VM boot volume with scsi meta data decoration:
Attached To
91f50dbc-8bdf-4293-84ea-fc5df27b5ee4 on /dev/sda
--------

Note: This commit doesn't address cases for
where instances are launched using existing
volume and snapshot, this will involve more
work to migrate the code from BDMv1 to BDMv2.

Using a scsi decorated image with:
hw_disk_bus='scsi'
hw_scsi_model='virtio-scsi'

This solve the case where an instance is
launched with 'image' selected as boot
source with a new volume. This will result
in /dev/vda instead of /dev/sda as it
should.

Not specifying device name in
setFinalSpecBootImageToVolume() leaves the
decision to nova to determine it.

Example:
-------
VM boot volume without scsi meta data decoration:
Attached To
0a0cd660-7ce3-4033-9983-2e1099edc5f0 on /dev/vda

VM boot volume with scsi meta data decoration:
Attached To
91f50dbc-8bdf-4293-84ea-fc5df27b5ee4 on /dev/sda
--------

Note: This commit doesn't address cases for
where instances are launched using existing
volume and snapshot, this will involve more
work to migrate the code from BDMv1 to BDMv2.

The BuildRequest object code assumed that IncompatibleObjectVersion
exception has a objver field that contains the object version. This
assumption is not true. The unit test made another mistake serializing
the function object obj_to_primitive instead of serializing the result
of the call of obj_to_primitive. This caused a false positive test

Versions since 2.25 no longer have this parameter, but we\ncontinue to support the older microversion.\n\nThis disk size check was broken when disk over commit was in use on\nthe host. In LibvirtDriver._assert_dest_node_has_enough_disk() we\ncorrectly calculate the required space using allocated disk size\nrather than virtual disk size when doing an over-committed check.\nHowever, we were checking against 'disk_available_least' as reported\nby the destination host. This value is: the amount of disk space which\nthe host would have if all instances fully allocated their storage. On\nan over-committed host it will therefore be negative, despite there\nactually being space on the destination host.\n\nThe check we actually want to do for disk over commit is: does the\ntarget host have enough free space to take the allocated size of this\ninstance's disks? We leave checking over-allocation ratios to the\nscheduler. Note that if we use disk_available_least here and the\ndestination host is over-allocated, this will always fail because free\nspace will be negative, even though we're explicitly ok with that.\n\nUsing disk_available_least would make sense for the non-overcommit\ncase, where the test would be: would the target host have enough free\nspace for this instance if the instance fully allocated all its\nstorage, and everything else on the target also fully allocated its\nstorage? As noted, we no longer actually run that test, though.\n\nWe fix the issue for legacy microversions by fixing the destination\nhost's reported disk space according to the given disk_over_commit\nparameter.\n\nChange-Id: I8a705114d47384fcd00955d4a4f204072fed57c2\nResolves-bug: #1708572\n(cherry picked from commit e097c001c8e11110efe8879da57264fcb7bdfdf2)\nSigned-off-by: Zhang Hua <joshua.zhang@canonical.com>\n\nRefix disk size during live migration with disk over-commit\n\nCurrently available disk of targer host is calculated based on\nlocal_gb, not available disk(free_disk_gb).

Prior to microversion 2.25, the migration api supported a
'disk_over_commit' parameter, which indicated that we should do disk
size check on the destination host taking into account disk
over-commit. Versions since 2.25 no longer have this parameter, but we
continue to support the older microversion.

This disk size check was broken when disk over commit was in use on
the host. In LibvirtDriver._assert_dest_node_has_enough_disk() we
correctly calculate the required space using allocated disk size
rather than virtual disk size when doing an over-committed check.
However, we were checking against 'disk_available_least' as reported
by the destination host. This value is: the amount of disk space which
the host would have if all instances fully allocated their storage. On
an over-committed host it will therefore be negative, despite there
actually being space on the destination host.

The check we actually want to do for disk over commit is: does the
target host have enough free space to take the allocated size of this
instance's disks? We leave checking over-allocation ratios to the
scheduler. Note that if we use disk_available_least here and the
destination host is over-allocated, this will always fail because free
space will be negative, even though we're explicitly ok with that.

Using disk_available_least would make sense for the non-overcommit
case, where the test would be: would the target host have enough free
space for this instance if the instance fully allocated all its
storage, and everything else on the target also fully allocated its
storage? As noted, we no longer actually run that test, though.

We fix the issue for legacy microversions by fixing the destination
host's reported disk space according to the given disk_over_commit
parameter.

We currently see a lot of warnings like this from
the soft_delete() method:

  sqlalchemy.exc.SAWarning: Evaluating non-mapped column expression
  'updated_at' onto ORM instances; this is a deprecated use case.
  Please make use of the actual mapped columns in ORM-evaluated
  UPDATE / DELETE expressions.

This is because the ""evaluate"" synchronization strategy would like
to search for objects and update them based on the UPDATE criteria
passed, however the columns given, literal_column('id'),
literal_column('updated_at'), are not mapped to anything. The
evaluator has to make a guess that the string contained in these
expressions should be matched to a mapped attribute on the given
entity and this guess was first removed in [1], then added back in
[2] with a warning (likely since oslo.db is invoking it).

This uses the actual entity-mapped column for the query rather
than the literal string column.

Problem description =================== In networking-ovn, the OVSDB Monitor class is responsible for listening the events OVSDB and performing certain actions on them. We do use it extensively for various tasks including critical ones such as monitor port binding events (in order to notify Neutron/Nova that a port has been bound to a certain chassis). Currently, this class uses a distributed OVSDB lock to ensure that only one instance is going to handle those events at a time. The problem with this approach is that it creates a bottleneck because even if we have multiple Neutron Workers running at the moment only one is actively handling those events. And, this problem is highlighted even more when working with technologies such as containers which relies on creating multiple ports at a time and waiting them to be bound. Proposed change =============== In order to fix this problem, this document proposes using a `Consistent Hash Ring`_ to split the load of handling events across multiple Neutron Workers. A new table called ``ovn_hash_ring`` will be created in the Neutron Database where the Neutron Workers capable of handling OVSDB events will be registered. The table will use the following schema: ================ ======== ================================================= Column name Type Description ================ ======== ================================================= node_uuid String Primary key. The unique identification of a Neutron Worker. hostname String The hostname of the machine this Node is running on. created_at DateTime The time that the entry was create. For troubleshooting purposes updated_at DateTime The time that the entry was updated. Used as a heartbeat to indicate that the Node still alive. ================ ======== ================================================= This table will be used to form the `Consistent Hash Ring`_. Fortunately, we have an implementation ready in the `tooz`_ library of OpenStack. It was contributed by the `Ironic`_ team which also uses this data structure in order to spread the API requests load across multiple Ironic Conductors. Here's how a `Consistent Hash Ring`_ from `tooz`_ works:: from tooz import hashring hr = hashring.HashRing({'worker1', 'worker2', 'worker3'}) # Returns set(['worker3']) hring[b'event-id-1'] # Returns set(['worker1']) hring[b'event-id-2'] How OVSDB Monitor will use the Ring ----------------------------------- Every instance of the OVSDB Monitor class will be listening to a series of events from the OVSDB database and each of them will have a unique ID registered in the database which will be part of the `Consistent Hash Ring`. When an event arrives, each OVSDB Monitor instance will hash that event UUID and the ring will return one instance ID, this is then compared with its own ID and if it matches that instance will then process the event. How to know if the OVSDB Monitor instance is alive -------------------------------------------------- A new maintenance task will be created in networking-ovn which will update the ``updated_at`` column from the ``ovn_hash_ring`` table for the entries matching its hostname indicating that all Neutron Workers for running on that hostname are alive. Note that only a single maintenance instance runs on each machine so the writes to the Neutron database are optimized. When forming the ring, the code should check for entries which the ``updated_at`` is newer than a given timeout. Entries that haven't been updated in a certain time won't be part of the ring, if the ring already exists it will be re-balanced. Clean up and minimizing downtime window --------------------------------------- Apart from heartbeating, we need to make sure that we remove the Nodes from the ring when the service is stopped or killed. By stopping the ``neutron-server`` service, all Nodes sharing the same hostname as the machine where the service is running will be removed from the ``ovn_hash_ring`` table. The same happens in case of a SIGTERM, the ``neutron-server`` service will start handling this signal and calling the same clean up method prior from the service stopping. Unfortunately nothing can be done in case of a SIGKILL, this will leave the nodes in the database and they will be part of the ring until the timeout is reached or the service is restarted. This can introduce a window of time which can result in some events being lost. The current implementation shares the same problem, if the instance holding the current OVSDB lock is killed abruptly events will be lost until the lock is moved on to the next instance alive. One could argue that the current implementation aggravates the problem because all events will be lost where with the distributed fashion **some** events will be lost. As far as distributed systems goes, that's a normal scenario and things are soon corrected. .. _`Consistent Hash Ring`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing .. _`tooz`: https://github.com/openstack/tooz .. _`Ironic`: https://github.com/openstack/ironic ",,125,0

The goal for this push request is to normalize the construction and use
 of internal, external, and admin URLs. While extending Kolla-ansible
 to enable a more flexible method to manage external URLs, we noticed
 that the same URL was constructed multiple times in different parts
 of the code. This can make it difficult for people that want to work
 with these URLs and create inconsistencies in a large code base with
 time. Therefore, we are proposing here the use of
 ""single Kolla-ansible variable"" per endpoint URL, which facilitates
 for people that are interested in overriding/extending these URLs.

As an example, we extended Kolla-ansible to facilitate the ""override""
of public (external) URLs with the following standard
""<component/serviceName>.<companyBaseUrl>"".
Therefore, the ""NAT/redirect"" in the SSL termination system (HAproxy,
HTTPD or some other) is done via the service name, and not by the port.
This allows operators to easily and automatically create more friendly
 URL names. To develop this feature, we first applied this patch that
 we are sending now to the community. We did that to reduce the surface
  of changes in Kolla-ansible.

Another example is the integration of Kolla-ansible and Consul, which
we also implemented internally, and also requires URLs changes.
Therefore, this PR is essential to reduce code duplicity, and to
facility users/developers to work/customize the services URLs.

Modifies _clean_empties function to take forbidden traits into account
in addition to required traits.

Added unit test test_resources_from_request_spec_flavor_forbidden_trait
to test that a single forbidden trait doesn't get lost in the
resources_from_request_spec function.

Also updated the functional test
test_flavor_forbidden_traits_based_scheduling to do the right thing.

We are using keepalive mode for IPMI Serial Over Lan console.
But when ironic-conductor dies it is not guaranteed that
SOL console also dies. It may still send ``keepalives`` to node.
This issue may break long-running sol sessions.
In some way it is needed to ensure that console process and other
child processes actually die on ironic-conductor exit.

This can be done starting ironic-conductor as service unit in systemd.
As ironic-conductor and its child processes have same cgroups, using
default systemd configuration, child processes will be also killed
on any conductor exit. It works for each type of process killing.

By default ``ipmitool sol activate`` command sends keepalive
to keep the IPMI session from timing out. In some cases it
breaks long running sol sessions, e.g. when conductor died
and new conductor has been started but still ipmi session
is still running.

This adds an option ``[console]sol_mode``, that can be
""keepalive"" or ""nokeepalive"". If not set, no
mode will be chosen.
For now it is used in ipmitool command when entering
Serial Over LAN, but applicable to other drivers.

More appropriate work had been proposed, see the last comments

Fixed functional test test_flavor_traits_based_scheduling as it
would pass 50% of the times even if the required trait was not
taken into account by adding a new part that disables the compute
host that has the required trait and retries, expecting a no valid
host error.

Added functional test test_flavor_forbidden_traits_based_scheduling
to test that forbidden traits are taken into account.

The second test temporarily passes where it should not until the
next commit where the bug is actually fixed.

Previously the only clean up action registered when creating a new
volume type was the direct removal of that type. However this request would
silently fail in the attached volume migration scenario tests if the
backends being used had their image volume cache enabled.

This was due to the image volume cache still containing volumes

the volume type. To avoid this these image volume cache volumes must be
manually removed by an admin user before deleting the volume type.

Without this setting, the software RAID code in the GenericHardwareManager of the IPA will ignore the given ``target_raid_config``. The ``controller`` property set to ``software`` will also be used by the conductor to identify a software RAID and trigger the required installation of the bootloader. While whole-disk images are expected to come with a bootloader configuration as part of the image, for software RAIDs in the current design the image will not be at the start of a real disk, but inside the first partition on top of a software RAID-1. The bootloader must hence be explicitly installed onto the underlying holder disks, and this property will indicate when to do this. An example of a valid software RAID configuration would hence look like:: { ""logical_disks"": [ { ""size_gb"": 100, ""raid_level"": ""1"", ""controller"": ""software"", }, { ""size_gb"": ""MAX"", ""raid_level"": ""0"", ""controller"": ""software"", } ] } drives to act as holder devices, support for simultaneous software and hardware RAIDdevices as well as support to partition the created RAID-N device are left for follow-up enhancements and beyond the scope of this specification.","drives to act as holder devices, as well as support to partition the created RAID-N device are left for follow-up enhancements and beyond the scope of this specification.",38,3

Problem description =================== * API users presently have to rely upon documentation of steps to know what is available. * Different steps may be available with different hardware managers. * With the increasing use of the Deploy Steps [2]_ framework, new steps should be anticipated to be added with new releases of Ironic. * The ``ironic-python-agent`` must be running to obtain a complete list of steps. Proposed change =============== In order to keep this solution relatively lightweight, there are four fundamental changes that will be needed in order to facilitate visibility. This doesn't seek to solve complete visibility by creating additional processes, but instead seeks to provide tools to collection of data, with the limiting factor we can only return the current available information. How we do it? ------------- Step 1 ~~~~~~ The initial step is to provide an API endpoint that returns the current available list of steps visible for a node running in the conductor. This would be an API endpoint, to a RPC method, to a conductor manager method, which would then return the list of steps, while tolerating the absence of ``ironic-python-agent``. Step 2 ~~~~~~ Addition of a ``hold`` provision state verb and ``holding`` state. +-----------------+-------------------+------------------------+ | *Initial State* | *Temporary State* | *Possible next verbs* | +-----------------+-------------------+------------------------+ | manageable | holding | manage, clean, active | +-----------------+-------------------+------------------------+ | available | holding | active, manage | +-----------------+-------------------+------------------------+ With the invocation of the state: * The machine is moved to the deployment network. * The deployment ramdisk is booted. * The ``ironic-python-agent`` would then be left in a running state, allowed to heartbeat (or be polled), and the API endpoint added in the prior step would a complete list of steps that can be executed upon. Alternatives ------------ An alternative to this solution would be to provide an async API endpoint to perform the steps detailed in step 2, and cache the data which could then be retrieved by the user asynchronously. In this case, the user would have to poll the API to determine if the cached information has been updated. The conundrum is that this would have to be constrained by states, which means we would still need to build state machine states around this to represent the current operation to users. Data model impact ----------------- None State Machine Impact -------------------- As noted above, we would add a new hold verb, which would allow transition back to the prior state. This ``hold`` verb would only be accessible from the ``manageable`` and ``available`` states. In this holding state, API users would be able to request logical next steps, in-line with the present state, as detailed in the table above. REST API impact --------------- The node object returned would expose additional ``provision_state`` states, however this is a known quantity with all state machine impacts. An additional provision state target verb of ``hold`` to trigger the state machine change. An endpoint will be added on to enable an API user to return the list of known steps via the RPC interface and the conductor, which will be triggered as a GET request. Example:: GET /v1/nodes/{node_ident}/steps[?type=(clean|deploy)] { ""deploy"": [ { ""interface"": ""deploy"", ""step"": ""deploy"", ""priority"": 100, }, ], ""clean"": [ { ""interface"": ""deploy"", ""step"": ""erase_devices"", ""reboot_requested"": False, ""priority"": 10, ""abortable"": True, }, { ""interface"": ""bios"", ""step"": ""apply_configuration"", ""args"": {....}, ""priority"": 0, }, { ""interface"": ""raid"", ""step"": ""create_configuration"", ""args"": {....}, ""priority"": 0 }, { ""interface"": ""raid"" ""step"": ""delete_configuration"", ""args"": {....}, ""priority"": 0 }, ] } If a specific ``type`` is requested, then the request shall only return the requested type of steps. If no type is defined, both sets will be returned to the caller. Normal response code: 200 Expected error codes:: * 400 with malformed request * 503 upon conductor error .. NOTE:: API micro-version will be incremented in accordance with standard procedure. Client (CLI) impact ------------------- ""ironic"" CLI ~~~~~~~~~~~~ None ""openstack baremetal"" CLI ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ An ``openstack baremetal node steps`` command will be added to facilitate returning the data exposed by this api. RPC API impact -------------- An new RPC method will need to be added called ``get_steps`` that will support a single argument to indicate what class of steps are being requested by the API user. Driver API impact ----------------- None is anticipated. Provision state specific code will be required in the AgentClient method to guard the retrieval of remote steps to only when the agent should be operating. If we are not in such a state, then the list would be returned without the data from a running agent. .. NOTE:: We should likely include a default return of our remote default clean steps in the deploy interface as that is the standard behavior in automated cleaning. Nova driver impact ------------------ None is required for this feature. That being said, there is value to enable a node to be scheduled which is being held for an available deployment. As such, it could be an optional enhancement which could save quite a bit of time in a deployment process. Ramdisk impact -------------- None Security impact --------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Scalability impact ------------------ None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Julia Kreger (TheJulia) <juliaashleykreger@gmail.com> Other contributors: ? Work Items ---------- * Implement API to retrieve a list of states. * Implement State machine changes to allow an idle agent instance to return cleaning step data. * Add API tests to ironic-tempest-plugin. * Add Admin documentation. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Basic API contract and state testing should be sufficient for this feature. Upgrades and Backwards Compatibility ==================================== N/A, The existing rolling upgrades and RPC version pinning practice should be more than sufficient to support this feature.

Horizon attempts to show associated share servers when displaying
share network details in the project share-networks dashboard.  But
unless the horizon user is an admin this generates a 403 exception
which in turn causes Horizon to pop-up an error message about being
unable to retrieve share network details.

So instead catch exceptions collecting share server information in
this context and continue on gracefully, presenting the share server
details that are available.

I0a2f89007994fbd7696b0f487affc1b7b643be74 is breaking our workaround for
IP conflict when Kuryr-Controller dies during some LB processing. In
that case, when LB is already created, Kuryr will try to create it again
and fail with either 409 or 500. We should react to those exceptions and
aforementioned patch breaks that by changing the type of exceptions
being raised.

This patch fixes that by adding correct requests.HTTPError exception
type to that try-except clause.

The ops repo isn't really software.   It's a collection of playbooks
that we share between operators, therefore, release notes are a bit
confusing because there are so many playbooks inside of it.

They're also broken because of how we have a few links all over the
place.  There has been no release notes published either.

sphinxmark is no longer compatible with the latest release of Sphinx
which is causing all of our documentation jobs to fail.  This patch
removes it as our current usage of openstacktheme for documentation
already provides watermarks for current branch and notices for which
branch the documentation covers.

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.
