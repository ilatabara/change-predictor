This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================== Agent Troubleshooting ===================== https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/XXXXXXX One of the greatest dificitulies with an ironic deployment is figuring out what happened to cause the deployment process to fail. Each operator builds institutional knowledge in to the causes why, and often makes improvements to avoid failure cases. However, the process of identifying what occured, and why, is still a process which requies a high degree of access to the underlying infrastucture and it's logs. Ultimatley, this is a barrier for access. We've made some improvements, recording high level actions/events of nodes to provide a level of insight, but the giant unknown is the agent. We need to make it so admin's don't need underlying server administrative access to troubleshoot common failure cases and issues. This starts with making the agent more able to be debugged without taking extra-ordinary steps including logging into remote servers. Problem description =================== Today, to figure what is going on, or figure out what happened with the agent during a deployment, you need to remotely access the conductor(s), after you find the conductor, and then navigate to the folder and extract the files. Of course, if a agent is in the middle of some work, you need to SSH into the agent, if you don't get an idea of the what is going on from the state information available on the node. This ultimately forces admins to have to take extra ordinary steps, or repeat processes, or embed static credentials. However, only a particular class of admin's have these capabilities and level of infrastucture access. And often, it is only a subset of those with API admin access who may have shell access to the conductor(s) or baremetal nodes in cleaning or provisioning. Proposed change =============== Add an ``/v1/node/<uuid>/agent_log/request`` and ``/v1/node/<uuid>/agent_log/retrieve`` endpoints to the REST api, and matching commands along the lines of ``baremetal node agent log reqeust`` and ``baremetal node agent log retrieve`` to enable operators to explicitly request log retrieval and then download the latest log file in possession of the conductor. This is intended as a best effort means of providing easy access to the log files without requiring an administrator to SSH into the infrastucture to retrieve the log files and extend accessibility where operationally appropriate, such as for system scoped API reader users. Alternatives ------------ Implement or suggest operators utilize log shipping, however our log packages include additional information, and operators would not be able to request a point in time snapshot through the same interface used to normally work with Ironic. Data model impact ----------------- No data model impact is anticipated. State Machine Impact -------------------- None REST API impact --------------- The REST api will be enhanced and recieve a microversion increase to support the two new API endpoints. Add an ``/v1/node/<uuid>/agent_log/request`` and ``/v1/node/<uuid>/agent_log/retrieve`` endpoints to the API. * ``/v1/node/<uuid>/agent_log/request`` A GET against the ``request`` endpoint will trigger an asyncronous task in the conductor to request and download the logs from a running agent. If the agent is not running or the request is at a time when the agent cannot be running, or no agent information is available, an error will be returned for the API requestor. If accepted, a ``202`` code will be returned. If rejected, a ``406`` code will be returned to the client. If access is denied, through policy, then a ``403`` error code will be returned to the API client. A successful operation will save the file to the conductor local disk using the same file pattern as normal agent log retrieval, typically ``/var/log/ironic/deploy``. No other API methods would be permitted. * ``/v1/node/<uuid>/agent_log/request`` A GET request against the ``retrieve`` endpoint will ask the conductor responsible for the node, as determiend through the hash ring, to request the file on conductor to return the latest log package for the node. If found, the file is returned to the API consumer through the RPC bus. If not found, the API consumer is returned with a 404 error. Client (CLI) impact ------------------- ""openstack baremetal"" CLI ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Commands will need to be added to the ``python-ironicclient`` library. These coommands would be ``baremetal node agent log request`` and ``baremetal node agent log retrieve``. ""openstacksdk"" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ No change to openstacksdk is anticipated at this time. RPC API impact -------------- Two additional RPC methods would be added to facilitate this feature. * ``request_agent_logs`` which will contain the requisite logic to validate the request, and then initiate an asynchronous taks in the background to request agent logs, if permissable and possible. * ``retrieve_agent_logs`` will request the file from the conductor based on the hash ring, and the method will return the file content for return to the API client. With these methods, the RPC version will be incremeneted, and the integrated pin logic behavior of the API will govern if these methods are usable. Driver API impact ----------------- None Nova driver impact ------------------ None Ramdisk impact -------------- No impact anticipated. Security impact --------------- This feature *can* result in contextual details of the infrastucutre to be retrievable via the API, and as such the default security policy for thie API endpoints should be such that they are generally reserved for System Scoped users *or* Owner-Admin users. Lessee-Admin users, at this time are not anticipated and generally the use concept for Lessees is a far more restricted use. Contrary to the RBAC model, Owner-Members and Owner-Readers will not be able to request logs to be retrieved, but in alignment with the model they will be permitted to download the files. Other end user impact --------------------- None Scalability impact ------------------ This feature does introduce additional tasks which are not anticipated to be exceptionally long running, and as user invoked they are expected to be rare in use. As such, no scalability impact is anticipated. Performance Impact ------------------ No performance impact is anticipated. Other deployer impact --------------------- Operators, which require continuity past conductor failure may need or want to explore usage of a network clustered filesystem for exchange and transfer of logs, however that is operaitonally not required by Ironic given this is a best effort retrieval and return of logging data to enable opearators to determine the cause of failures and remedy them. Developer impact ---------------- Developers lives may be improved by easier operator log ability to get coffee. Possibly operartors may be willing to fund coffee. Please! Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Julia Kreger (TheJulia) juliaashleykreger@gmail.com Other contributors: ??? Work Items ---------- * Implement RPC methods * Implement API methods * Implement Unit tests to cover logic cases and use patterns expected. * Implement client support Dependencies ============ * None Testing ======= This feature is not expected to require additional testing. Upgrades and Backwards Compatibility ==================================== Existing upgrade controls should cover this issue. Log file retrieval from the agent has existed for quite some time, so ultimatley this feature is focused on enabling access to that information. Documentation Impact ==================== None anticipated. References ========== * https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/ironic-yoga-ptg ",,262,0

In some cases it may be desirable to run the libvirt daemon on the host.
For example, when mixing host and container OS distributions or
versions.

This change makes it possible to disable the nova_libvirt container, by
setting enable_nova_libvirt_container to false. The default values of
some Docker mounts and other paths have been updated to point to default
host directories rather than Docker volumes when using a host libvirt
daemon.

This change does not handle migration of existing systems from using
a nova_libvirt container to libvirt on the host.

oslo.policy expects the key project_id, not tenant_id anymore. This was
causing the GET /v2/dataframes policy check to fail:

    $ openstack --rating-api-version 2 rating dataframes get
    {""message"": ""You are not authorized to perform this action""} (HTTP 403)

In the v1 API, the storage:list_data_frames operation was not affected
because it uses project_id.

Tested [aarch64, armv7l, ppc64, ppc64le] on DevStack with both kvm and
qemu virt_type set.

Launching a guest will fail if guest arch isn't supported, but that is
already the current behavior.

Nova scheduler ignores the hw_architecture field from glance, which
means the scheduler will schedule a mismatched guest on any host. The
scheduler does, however, respect capabilities:cpuinfo:model set in the
image flavor, and the rest of the compute host capabilites flavor
metadata entries.

This patch currently takes advantage of the hw_architecture glance
metadata entry to allow nova-compute to decide when to try to emulate
once it has been scheduled. There are three general use cases in mind:

1. User wants to emulate: user would set hw_architecture when uploading
image.

2. User wants to run on native hardware: openstack clusters with
multiple host architectures would provide flavors for each host arch and
set the cpu model appropriately, and users would set hw_architecture
when uploading images. This probably really complicates things when, for
example, a user wants to run an arm32 image natively on an aarch64 host.
Non-x86 virt/emulation gets really weird really quickly.

3. User doesn't care and just wants their image to work. This is
probably the most common use case, and the user would still just set
hw_architecture when uploading their images.

Unittests for privsep and rootwrap fail if it runs on non-linux env
such as MacOS, or other than devstack environment. It's because
`oslo.privsep` and its tool are not installed properly in tox env.
So, skip the tests on other than devstack env to avoid such a failure.

This patch also modifies `pypath` in initialization of Privcontext
because its fstring cannot be expanded correctly in some environment
and tests are failed.

Currently tox jobs are broken because python-glareclient can't be

The conflict is caused by:

The Glare project has been unmaintained for a while[1]. It does not

Because of these points, this change removes dependency on Glare.

This patch implements the following APIs defined in ETSI NFV-SOL003
v3.3.1 5.5.2.11a with 'Kubernetes' vim.
    1. Create VNF
    2. Instantiate VNF
    3. Change Current VNF Package
    4. Terminate VNF
    5. Delete VNF

Retry and rollback operation of change current vnf package API with
'Kubernetes' vim are also supported.

There are the following points to note.
    1. Currently only 'RollingUpdate' is supported for
    CNF deployment update.
    2. 'Instantiate' VNF cannot rollback and retry with 'Kubernetes'
    vim. It will be supported in future.

This patch implements change current vnf package task
defined in ETSI NFV-SOL003 v3.3.1 5.5.2.11a.

Retry and rollback operation of change current vnf package
API are also supported.

Note that currently only 'RollingUpdate' is supported for
VNF image's update.

This patch refactors the userdata_utils file and writes
the common methods into the new common/common_script_utils.py
file, so some changes are made to the existing instantiate
code.

This patch is roughly an adaptation of
Ia6fc9011ee6f5461f40a1307b72709d769814a79 for cinder.

During an upgrade, cinder pins the version of RPC calls to the minimum
seen across all services. This ensures that old services do not receive
data they cannot handle. After the upgrade is complete, all cinder
services are supposed to be reloaded to cause them to check again the
RPC versions of services and use the new latest version which should now
be supported by all running services.

There is a second issue in that it takes some time for the upgraded
services to update the cinder services database table with their new
version. We need to wait until all cinder services have done this
before the restart is performed, otherwise the RPC version cap will
remain in place. There is currently no interface in cinder available for
checking these versions, so as a workaround we use a configurable
delay with a default duration of 30 seconds, as we do for nova.

This change restarts all cinder services after an upgrade, after a 30
second delay.

We build IPA images in the seed jobs, so we don't need to download IPA
images. We don't use the deployment image, so we don't need to download
Cirros. Also, these downloads depend on external resources which may
make jobs less reliable.

For seed upgrade jobs, disable IPA and deployment image downloads.

CI: use dib.yml for bifrost overrides

Follow up to Ib59c8bc2d8938eca18c943bb2e66ed185152a739, which stopped
downloads of the Cirros image in the seed jobs, but inadvertently
enabled DIB builds in the seed upgrade job. This is because
kolla-ansible sets create_image_via_dib to true in dib.yml, and that
file takes precedence over bifrost.yml.

This change fixes the issue by providing Bifrost overrides in CI using
dib.yml.

This patch is roughly an adaptation of
Ia6fc9011ee6f5461f40a1307b72709d769814a79 for cinder.

During an upgrade, cinder pins the version of RPC calls to the minimum
seen across all services. This ensures that old services do not receive
data they cannot handle. After the upgrade is complete, all cinder
services are supposed to be reloaded to cause them to check again the
RPC versions of services and use the new latest version which should now
be supported by all running services.

There is a second issue in that it takes some time for the upgraded
services to update the cinder services database table with their new
version. We need to wait until all cinder services have done this
before the restart is performed, otherwise the RPC version cap will
remain in place. There is currently no interface in cinder available for
checking these versions, so as a workaround we use a configurable
delay with a default duration of 30 seconds, as we do for nova.

This change restarts all cinder services after an upgrade, after a 30
second delay.

This patch is roughly an adaptation of
Ia6fc9011ee6f5461f40a1307b72709d769814a79 for cinder.

During an upgrade, cinder pins the version of RPC calls to the minimum
seen across all services. This ensures that old services do not receive
data they cannot handle. After the upgrade is complete, all cinder
services are supposed to be reloaded to cause them to check again the
RPC versions of services and use the new latest version which should now
be supported by all running services.

There is a second issue in that it takes some time for the upgraded
services to update the cinder services database table with their new
version. We need to wait until all cinder services have done this
before the restart is performed, otherwise the RPC version cap will
remain in place. There is currently no interface in cinder available for
checking these versions, so as a workaround we use a configurable
delay with a default duration of 30 seconds, as we do for nova.

This change restarts all cinder services after an upgrade, after a 30
second delay.

Sometimes API layer can add restrictions to not allow

Unittests for privsep and rootwrap fail if it runs on non-linux env
such as MacOS, or other than devstack environment. It's because
`oslo.privsep` and its tool are not installed properly in tox env.
So, skip the tests on other than devstack env to avoid such a failure.

This patch also modifies `pypath` in initialization of Privcontext
because its fstring cannot be expanded correctly in some environment
and tests are failed.

Add the ability to replace an overcloud node that's running the etcd
service by updating the etcd cluster's membership to delete the old
node (the one being replaced) with the new replacement node.

etcd maintains its cluster membership using each node's name and it's
cluster peer address on the internal_api network. This data typically
changes when replacing an overcloud node. The cluster membership is
updated using a shell script that's triggered to run after etcd is
deployed on the new node.

membership changes.

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect
rule on releases.openstack.org so that anyone working on this branch
will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when
the requirements repository branches.

Until the requirements repository has as stable/yoga branch, tests will
continue to use the upper-constraints list on master.

You can configure it on the cinder side with the usual replication configuration. Refer to the :doc:`documentation </contributor/replication>` for more information. You will also have to configure replication on the Ceph side. To do so you may refer to the `Ceph documentation <https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rbd/rbd-mirroring/>`_. Note that with the RBD driver in cinder you need to configure the pool replication option in image mode. For instance, if your pool is named ``volumes``, the command would be: ``rbd mirror pool enable volumes image``.",,16,0

Id1b4e9775c834b8b97e086241ee8b247977225a2, but removes the override of
ironic_boot_mode in the TLS job.

This ensures that old services do not receive\ndata they cannot handle.

This patch is roughly an adaptation of
Ia6fc9011ee6f5461f40a1307b72709d769814a79 for cinder.

During an upgrade, cinder pins the version of RPC calls to the minimum
seen across all services. This ensures that old services do not receive
data they cannot handle. After the upgrade is complete, all cinder
services are supposed to be reloaded to cause them to check again the
RPC versions of services and use the new latest version which should now
be supported by all running services.

There is a second issue in that it takes some time for the upgraded
services to update the cinder services database table with their new
version. We need to wait until all cinder services have done this
before the restart is performed, otherwise the RPC version cap will
remain in place. There is currently no interface in cinder available for
checking these versions, so as a workaround we use a configurable
delay with a default duration of 30 seconds, as we do for nova.

This change restarts all cinder services after an upgrade, after a 30
second delay.

consequently you'd hit:

possibility in backwards compatible way.

It is possible to workaround this issue by invoking the module a second

Update the URL to the upper-constraints file to point to the redirect
rule on releases.openstack.org so that anyone working on this branch
will switch to the correct upper-constraints list automatically when
the requirements repository branches.

continue to use the upper-constraints list on master.

Unused workdir argument of the run_validations method removed.

Host and playbook skipping simplified.

Docstrings adjusted, including some of the more important
inline code examples.

Test sensitivity to API changes was increased.
More strict assertions have been put on the calls made in CLI.

Logging statements related to the run action
in validation_actions.py were expanded.

New debug level logging statements introduced.

One of the testing constants in the fakes.py was altered
as it was not accurate representation of the real data,
and as such was breaking the new logging statements
during unit test runs.

Deprecation notice for 'log_path' and 'groups' arguments,
in both docstring and logging.

Redundant conditionals for argument types were removed.

The checks of the arguments are implemented
in the function called in the subsequent statement.

As there is no scenario in which one set of these checks
passes, while the other fails with the same values,
we can consider one of them to be redundant.

Helper function 'get_validations_details' without active references
was removed from utils submodule.

Following validations were detecting changes in the image
used by CI and reporting them as issues.
While correct in case of a customer deployment,
it is unnecessary within the component pipeline.

The catalogue test will now no longer execute this validation.

Following validations will recieve variable overrides.

- add a build-requirements.txt
- modify charmcraft.yaml
- modify osci.yaml

- modify tox.ini
    -> tox -e build does charmcraft build/rename
    -> tox -e build-reactive does the reactive build
- modify bundles to use the <charm>.charm artifact in tests.
  and fix deprecation warning re: prefix

Unless the inventory consists of only localhost, we are going to check
it's presence and formatting, before actually starting validations.

Docstring of the 'read_cli_data_file' was expanded to provide more info.

With change I603521bd00dc100e03c765c25503b5e01f3383e4
the ManageNetworks == False use case was overlooked.

When ManageNetworks is set to False and networks are
not created we need to build network_attrs and
subnet_attrs from the data present in network_data.yaml
and parameters.

The network_attrs and subnet_attrs was backported to
ussuri and train in change:
I3309f2a0e39ad115930ecd5c0e895816565819e9

osp-director-operator need this fix as it is using
manage_networks: false.

This patch implements the following APIs defined in ETSI NFV-SOL003
v3.3.1 5.5.2.11a with 'Kubernetes' vim.
    1. Create VNF
    2. Instantiate VNF
    3. Change Current VNF Package
    4. Terminate VNF
    5. Delete VNF

Retry and rollback operation of change current vnf package API with
'Kubernetes' vim are also supported.

There are the following points to note.
    1. Currently only 'RollingUpdate' is supported for
    CNF deployment update.
    2. 'Instantiate' VNF cannot rollback and retry with 'Kubernetes'
    vim. It will be supported in future.

This is especially true for older releases, such as train, where
mistral was still used in order to orchestrate the different playbooks

When Memcached uses IPv6 network, python-memcached requires that each
server name is formatted as is described in the following example.
 inet6:[<host>]:<port>

This change ensures the format is properly applied according to
the IP protocol version and cache backend used.

Note that the parameter in keystone was not properly formatted even
when IPs are used to set the parameter. This change fixes that and
ensure the parameter is properly configured.

Also, this change fixes the timing to apply any2array. The function
should be applied before we check the first memcache server by [0],
otherwise the logic to detect IPv6 address does not work as intended.

Move the software RAID code path from grub2-install to
efibootmgr:

- remove the UEFI efibootmgr exception for software RAID
- create and populate the ESPs on the holder disks
- update the NVRAM with all ESPs (the component devices
  of the ESP mirror, use unique labels to avoid unintentional
  deduplication of entries in the NVRAM)

In addition, use canonical device names for the RAID device for
the ESP: it seems like tinyIPA silently replaces /dev/md/esp

instead. Also rescan the resulting device before copying files.

Starting in focal, the ubuntu version of corosync package synced in from
debian includes node1 as the default name for the local node with a nodeid
of 1. This causes the cluster to have knowledge of this extra node1 node,
which affects quorum, etc. Installing the charm's corosync.conf file
before package installation prevents this conditioning from happening.

Additionally this change removes some Xenial bits in the charm and always
includes a nodelist in corosync.conf as it is compulsory in focal and
newer. It is optional in the bionic packages, so we'll always just
render the nodelist.

A virtual IP port is a port with an IP address assigned. This IP
address is used as an allowed address pair in a bound port (or ports).
This port is marked as ""virtual"" and a list of ""virtual-parents""
(ports with the VIP assigned as allowed address pair) will be
populated accordingly.

This patch updates the ""binding:host_id"" of the port when OVN detects
traffic from the corresponding VIP address. OVN updates the VIP port
SB ""Port_Binding"" register with the chassis ID. The hostname of this
chassis is used to update the port host ID.

The VIP port is always unbound and down; this patch only populates the
host information to provide to the user this information using the
OpenStack CLI, instead of making this search using the OVN CLI.

When memcached is using IPv6 network, some parameters like
[keystone_authtoke] memcached_servers require each server name has
inet6 prefix, as is described in the following example.

 inet6:[<hostname>]:<port>

This change introduces the global parameter so that puppet can detect
whether memcached is using IPv6 network.

If enable_dhcp is modified to false on a subnet, network_info
still has dhcp_server information resulting in metadata server
reporting VM network type as ipv4_dhcp.

Currently the dhcp ports from the same subnet are retrieved based on
device_owner network:dhcp and updates dhcp_server if dhcp ports
exist on the subnet. Add an extra check to verify if enable_dhcp
is set to True.

This problem is only in Ussuri but not in Victoria release and further
as device_owner is changed to network:distributed for dhcp ports [1]
and dhcp_server update is handled in [2]

This patch just adds an extra check on the tripleo inventory before
adding the current host under the corresponding role.
This patch doesn't change the behavior of inventory generation, and
the complexity is not changed as well.
By doing this we're able to handle a less common scenario where the
inventory is expanded [1] using the heat stack hosts, but the networks
are represented with a wrong array like: ['', '', ..].

This patch just adds an extra check on the tripleo inventory before
adding the current host under the corresponding role.
This patch doesn't change the behavior of inventory generation, and
the complexity is not changed as well.

This patch implements change current vnf package task
defined in ETSI NFV-SOL003 v3.3.1 5.5.2.11a.

Retry and rollback operation of change current vnf package
API are also supported.

Note that currently only 'RollingUpdate' is supported for
VNF image's update.

This patch refactors the userdata_utils file and writes
the common methods into the new common/common_script_utils.py
file, so some changes are made to the existing instantiate
code.

Designate no longer uses the parameters in the [backend:bind9] section,
since ppols.yaml was introduced. This change ensures the parameters in
this wrong section are purged.

Also, this change introduces support for setting up backend using
pools.yaml according to the current installation guide.

Backport note
- Adjusted some logic to use hard-coded user/group names, because
  34ff6e6f04a69fec9579accc0bcc5f1c29049abe is not present in
  stable/xena.
