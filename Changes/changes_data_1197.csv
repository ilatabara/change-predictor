This commit adds support for requesting credentials by a role from the
credentials providers. This entails 2 things, first adding support for
specifying roles in a test-accounts file with test-accounts based
providers and secondly adding support to isolated-creds to assign
arbitrary roles on credentials requested by role.

Switch from port-based tunneling to flow-based tunneling.
This would improve scalability as a single vport per
network_type is enough even when there are a ton of tunnel
peers.

This commit makes ofagent use some of NXMs.  Namely, tun_ipv4_src
and tun_ipv4_dst.  While the use of NXMs contradicts with one of
goals of ofagent, i.e. portablity to other switch implementations,
it isn't a problem right now because tunnel port support is
OVS-dependant anyway.  There are no widely implemented standards
covering tunnel port managements.

The support of the above mentioned NXMs is added to Ryu recently.
Mention the required version of Ryu in README.

This patch creates the /openstack/log directory within the AIO bootstrap
script to prevent 'unstable' results in openstack-infra's jenkins.

It also moves the symlink to that directory to much earlier in the

This is responsibility that is not to be taken lightly. Adding or Removing Core Reviewers --------------------------------- A new Neutron core reviewer may be proposed at anytime on the openstack-dev mailing list. Typically, the Neutron PTL will propose a new member after discussions with the existing core reviewers. Once a proposal has been made, five existing Neutron core reviewers must respond to the email with a +1. Another Neutron core reviewer can vote -1 to veto the proposed new core reviewer. The PTL may remove a Neutron core reviewer at any time. Typically when a member has decreased their involvment with the project through a drop in reviews and participation in general project development, the PTL will propose their removal and remove them. Please note there is no voting or vetoing of core reviewer removal. Members who have previously been a core reviewer may be fast-tracked back into a core reviewer role if their involvment picks back up and the existing core reviewers support their re-instatement. Core Reviewer Membership Expectations ------------------------------------- Neutron core reviewers have the following expectations: * Resonable attendance at the weekly Neutron IRC meetings. * Participation in Neutron discussions on the mailing list, as well as in-channel in #openstack-neutron. * Particiaption in Neutron related design summit sessions at the OpenStack Summits. In addition to the above, code reviews are the most important requirement of Neutron core reviewers. Neutron follows the documented OpenStack `code review guidelines <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ReviewChecklist>`_. We encourage all people to review Neutron patches, but core reviewers are required to maintain a level of review numbers relatively close to other core reviewers. There are no hard statistics around code review numbers, but in general we use 30, 60, 90 and 180 day stats when examing review stats. * `30 day review stats <http://stackalytics.com/report/contribution/neutron-group/30>`_ * `60 day review stats <http://stackalytics.com/report/contribution/neutron-group/60>`_ * `90 day review stats <http://stackalytics.com/report/contribution/neutron-group/90>`_ * `180 day review stats <http://stackalytics.com/report/contribution/neutron-group/180>`_ There are soft-touch items around being a Neutron core reviewer as well. Gaining trust with the existing Neutron core reviewers is important. Being able to work together with the existing Neutron core review team is critical as well. Being a Neutron core reviewer means spending a significant amount of time with the existing Neutron core reviewer team on IRC, the mailing list, at Summits, and in reviews. Ensuring you participate and engage here is critical to becoming and remaining a core. ",,293,0

the public network has a gateway IP of 172.29.248.1 from the

This creates a noauth2 auth_strategy which is similar to noauth,
except it only gives you an admin context if the username passed in is
'admin'. This allows testing of non admin activities.

noauth is deprecated as of this commit. While we expect that it would
only be used in testing, it is exposed as a conf option, so could be
used behind a different auth proxy.

Also make the error path for pipeline loading contain a full
LOG.exception. This is a fatal condition for nova, and the current
error was often quite opaque. The full stack trace during this fatal

Enhance the flavor manage functional tests to nearly cover what's done
in the equivalent Tempest tests (especially the negative
tests). Specifically we add tests for deleted flavor handling, and
bounds checking of various parameters.

The remaining missing negative tests are related to authorization
testing, which requires more changes to the OSAPIFixture
infrastructure.

The convergence design requires extra data to be stored with each Stack
row in order to manage concurrent updates.

In the update query for updating the stack, session synchronization
is set to False to avoid error causing due to status_reason column
inherited in Stack table from the StateAware table. Updates to
status_reason column is handled via @property and this causes problems
due to the fact that the UPDATE...WHERE updates it in DB but fails to

Requirements changes to projects trigger tempest/grenade
jobs. However, these are exactly the same tests as would have just
been run in the requirements job before we propose requirements
changes to projects. So the merge of a requirements change current
creates a great thundering herd in all the projects.

Skip if this is the proposal bot and the only content changed is
requirements. The requirements check job will ensure that people can't
sneak an invalid requirement range in.

The rationale for this change is the same as for merged change
to swift func tests job [1].

The swiftclient functional test job was changed to run
tox -e func as sudo [2]. The job first runs functional tests
against keystone, then repeats the tests against tempauth.
The second part of the job requires SWIFT_TEST_CONFIG_FILE
env var to be set to cause the tests to run against tempauth.
The introduction of sudo in [2] causes this env var to be lost,
so the tests run against keystoneauth again.

Allow supplying filename and paths with '**' recursive glob matches
to zuul-swift-upload. Since bash (or shell etc) will expand on any
filenames provided to the program this needs to be used in quotes.

Usage example:
./zuul_swift_upload.py my_results.txt '**/sdist/*.zip' output.log

The hierarchy is always flattened meaning the supplied list is
placed in the topmost generated index.html. Sub-folders still keep
their hierarchy.

Further teasing DVR apart from the agent and other router types.  This
change illustrates the need to use plugin_rpc and context from the
agent.  It leaves this as a dependence of dvr_router on the instance
of the agent.  So, when the agent creates a dvr_router, it passes
itself in as an argument.  It doesn't do this with other router types.

I would like to eliminate the dependence of RPC while processing a
router.  However, this is just a refactor and at least decouples it as
much as possible and isolates the dependence to DVR only.

this can be done with the following command:

The semantics of these values are specific, and an interface we'd
carried over from the old ansible modules really just makes things more
confusing.

Requests expects that verify can either be True/False or can be the path
to a cacert bundle. That makes it very hard to do input parameter
validation in ansible. So - split that into verify which takes a boolean

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================== Containerize Tripleo ==================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/containerize-tripleo Containerizing TripleO offers significant advantages and value for OpenStack deployers. By using containers, it is possible to have automatic high availability and automatic deployment of the OpenStack deployed services by simply starting and starting the container. Big advantages are added around configuration management as well. Since containers are immutable, they offer a nicely improved image management model. OpenStack vendors can place their latest images as well as any older versions in a Docker repo for full upgrade and downgrade to any version the OpenStack vendors make available. The dependency we prefer to use for this model is an OS image that contains docker and kubernetes. Kubernetes will run a check script on a configurable interval. If it returns an error, the container will be restarted. This is how high availability is automated without a bunch of extra complication. When a deployer wishes to upgrade her cloud, she simply requests tripleo to redeploy one of the services. This executes library calls in the proposed blueprint which stop and start the impacted services with minimal downtime. The configuration management that is handled by puppet can either be reused in this model or refactored to store key/value pairs in the tripleo configuration system. With the later model, configuration management doesn't require any configuration management dependency. All of the configuration managemnt is handled by tripleO and as key-value pairs sent to the container on start. A configuration change stops and starts the impacted service which reconfigures the service based upon the latest images. Problem Description =================== Use cases: * Reconfigure a service without redploying the entire node or involving a third party CM dependency. * High availability without configuring a third party dependency such as The Linux high availability stack Pacemaker + Corosync. * Very high availability upgrades without redploying the entire node, but instead just redeploying the impacted containers on an already deployed Ironic node. Proposed Change =============== First the kolla core will develop a library for TripleO to use. Where this library lives is up to the reviewers. Some options include the kolla stackforge repo, oslo, or somewhere else in tripelo. The library will deploy either Fedora Atomic, RHEL Atomic, or CoreOS. These operating systems support Docker + Kubernetes out of the box. For those deploying Ubuntu, we suspect Ubuntu Snappy will eventually provide similar functionality we require as based on the other reference operating systems. Once deployed, the library will manage upgrade and downgrade of services. The library will be integrated somewhere inside tripleo (hints as to where would be appreciated from the reviewers :) The scope of the effort is only around the development of the library and intregration of the library with TripleO. Alternatives ------------ Another option for container deployment is to depend on a container as a service solution such as Magnum. The blueprint authors believe Magnum will be prime time in L-M cycles before considered for Incubation, so the path is slower. The advantage of this proposal is it wraps the functionality in a library so a CaaS such as Magnum could be used to do the job when it is available. Security Impact --------------- This change involves parsing the key/value configuration pairs, which may include sensistive data such as administrator or other passwords in Keystone. Other End User Impact --------------------- Ideally the user would be shielded from this change via abstraction. There may be some configuration options required, however, which should be set. Performance Impact ------------------ We don't expect much impact on performance since the solution refactors the existing deployment a bit. The usage of kubernetes and docker on the deployed nodes does have a small memory footprint impact. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- Config options will be added. It is unclear if the library will require persistent storage, but it may, in which case a database URI must be configured. The change does not take effect unless it is explicitly enabled as part of the deployment process. Developer Impact ---------------- We see minimal impact on developers. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: sdake@redhat.com Other contributors: kolla-core@review.openstack.org Work Items ---------- * Define top level API of integration with TripelO (2-4 weeks) as a spec likely living in the kolla repo * Implement API (4-6 weeks) likely in kolla repo but open to suggestions * Integrate library into TripleO code base (TODO: where precisely?) Dependencies ============ * Ironic Bare metal service. * A Kubernetes and Docker enabled base operating system deployed via Ironic. * This library by the TripleO code base. Note this library has not been designed or implemented. Testing ======= Should be testable via current CI. Documentation Impact ==================== * The configuration options should be documented. * The advantages and any disadvantages of container deployment should be documented. References ========== None ",,165,0

To this aim a new 'neutron-services' feature is added. Services for

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================ Image Conversion ================ https://blueprints.launchpad.net/glance/+spec/basic-import-conversion Basic import conversion of image format With the support of asynchronous operations and the new import workflow in Glance (see the dependency tree), it will possible to have an image format conversion on the fly while importing an image. Problem description =================== Most of the time, user have to convert the image to the expected format manually before creating image in Glance. For example, in Ceph RBD scenario, it only supports raw image. So user have to convert a qcow2 image downloaded from Ubuntu Cloud Archive to raw format by qemu-img. Proposed change =============== The conversion will be provided by a plugin of the import workflow. This plugin can be activated or not based on the deployer configuration. This means that the deployer will need to specify the preferred format of images for the deployment. This blueprint will handle the conversion of formats supported by qemu-img convert: raw, qcow2, vdi, vmdk and vpc. Alternatives ------------ User have to convert the image format manually and who will be blocked until the conversion complete. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- 1. Policy enforcement 2. Necessary image inspection, like image size. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- Deployer need to make sure there is qemu-img installed on controller node.

Testing ======= Some necessary test cases will be added to test the image conversion code. Documentation Impact ==================== The image REST API document will be updated to indicate the post body change for this feature. Such as the source format and expected format.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================== Glance VMware store to support multiple datastores ================================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/glance/+spec/vmware-store-multiple-datastores Glance, when configured to use VMware store, stores the images in a virtual storage container called datastore, identified by the configuration option vmware_datastore_name. The size of the datastore can only be increased to a certain limit which also depends upon the underlying physical storage. The capacity of the store is thus bound by the size of a single datastore and poses serious scalability issues. Problem description =================== Currently the number of images stored by glance, when configured to use VMware store, is limited by the capacity of a single datastore. The size of a datastore has an upper bound [1]. e.g The maximum datastore size is 64TB when backed by VMFS-5 filesystem. While the same for a datastore with NFS may depend on the storage array vendor. While this is the theoretical maximum based on the supported filesystem, datastores are also sized based on the underlying physical storage, including internal and external devices and networked storage. With networked storage the choice of storage protocol (iSCSI, FC, FCoE) also play a vital role in deciding the optimal size. Thus, the capacity of a datastore used in a datacenter varies by deployment. Apart from the capacity, there may be a performance bottleneck when many compute nodes concurrently access a single datastore to download images. Proposed change =============== To allow adding more capacity and improving performance, we suggest the use of multiple datastores for storing images. There is only one major aspect of the proposed change: - Datastore Selection. **1) Datastore Selection:** This change proposes to select a datastore based on the priority given to it by the operator and the capacity to accommodate the image. A new configuration option (say vmware_datastores) will be added that would enable the operator to specify multiple datastores along with their relative priority. The proposed format is 'datastore_name:priority,'. In case of equal priority the selection will be based on the maximum freespace available on the datastore. This approach is very similar to filesystem_store_datadirs used by filesystem store. Example: say vmware_datastores = 'nfs_datastore:100, iscsi_datastore:100, ssd_datastore: 200'. Here, ssd_datastore will be the preferred datastore if it can accommodate the image being added. Otherwise, nfs_datastore or iscsi_datastore will be chosen based on maximum freespace available. Alternatives ------------ 1) The datastore selection can be done through round-robin/randomized strategy instead of priority-based. This would be ideal if all datastores are of same type and perform similarly. But since datastores are of different types, the strategy is best driven by operator input. e.g SSD backed datastores may be faster that networked datastores. While its possible to determine the type of datastore, implicit assumptions cannot be made. Data model impact ----------------- Does not have any impact on glance data model. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- This spec only adds a selection logic to the existing functionality and hence does not have any security impact. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ The use of multiple datastores will reduce concurrent operations on a single datastore. Thus, it will perform better in large deployments. Other deployer impact --------------------- This proposal will allow administrators to configure multiple datastores to save glance image in VMware storage backend. If enabled, it will override the existing configuration option vmware_datastore that allows to specify a single datastore. If disabled, the store will fallback to vmware_datastore option. Thus, the change is backwards compatible. New configuration option in *glance-api.conf* **vmware_datastores** - required Example: vmware_datastores = 'datastore1:100, datastore2:100, datastore3:200' or vmware_datastores = 'datastore1:1' Note: 1. datastore with priority 200 has precedence over datastores with priority 100. 2. If no priority is specified, default priority ‘0’ is associated with it. 3. If two datastores have same priority, datastore with maximum free space will be chosen to store the image. 4. If same datastore is specified multiple times then BadStoreConfiguration exception will be raised. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: smurugesan Other contributors: None Reviewers --------- Core reviewer(s): TBD Other reviewer(s): None Work Items ---------- 1) Implement new config option in VMware store driver. 2) Implement datastore selection logic in the VMware store driver. 3) Implement unit tests. 4) Change glance-api sample conf in glance repository. Dependencies ============ * May need new utility methods in oslo.vmware. Mostly the proposed change can use existing methods to implement this change. But it may be wise to implement common functionality in oslo.vmware, if any. Testing ======= * Tempest tests are not required. Documentation Impact ==================== * Document new configuration options. References ========== [1] http://www.vmware.com/pdf/vsphere5/r55/vsphere-55-configuration-maximums.pdf ",,196,0

The _member_ role must be created because horizon uses this as the default role
to add to users in projects. Unfortunately because we need to add the role id
to the CONF file we have to create this role, insert it into the config file
and then restart keystone to have the change take effect.

This is a similar process as what needs to happen with defining administration
domain_ids for policy so create a function that can be used to bootstrap
keystone with these sort of database/config file synchronized values.

Running Cue API behind Apache2 ============================== .. note:: In this howto we explain how to setup cue-api to run behind a Apache2 instance vs as a process of it's own. We will assume that cue is available under /opt/stack/cue as it is in devstack. Symlink app.wsig to /var/www :: $ sudo mkdir /var/www/cue $ sudo ln -s /opt/stack/cue/cue/api/app.wsgi /var/www/cue Setup Apache2 config :: $ sudo cp /opt/cue/etc/apache2/cue.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available $ sudo a2ensite cue $ sudo service apache2 reload You should now have cue-api running under Apache2!

This mechanism attempts to destroy any locally-running instances on
startup if instance.host != self.host. The assumption is that the
instance has been evacuated and is safely running elsewhere. This is
a dangerous assumption to make, so this patch adds a configuration
variable to disable this behavior if it's not desired.

Note that disabling it may have implications for the case where
instances *were* evacuated, given potential shared resources.
To counter that problem, this patch also makes _init_instance()
skip initialization of the instance if it appears to be owned
by another host, logging a prominent warning in that case.

As a result, if you have destroy_after_evacuate=False and you start
a nova compute with an incorrect hostname, or run it twice from
another host, then the worst that will happen is you get log
warnings about the instances on the host being ignored. This should
be an indication that something is wrong, but still allow for
fixing it without any loss. If the configuration option is disabled
and a legitimate evacuation does occur, simply enabling it and then
restarting the compute service will cause the cleanup to occur.

This is added to the workarounds config group because it is really
only relevant while evacuate is fundamentally broken in this way.
It needs to be refactored to be more robust, and once that is done,
this should be able to go away.

The existing timeutils provides a way to measure durations
that is also used to get actual times and dates; for most
cases this dual ability is not needed and the user only cares
about the duration between two time points. In cases where
ntpd may affect the machine clock this usage is also incorrect
and may go backwards in time...

To support this kind of specific and frequently occurring usage
a stopwatch class can be used that can enable more accurate
gathering of *just* durations (and using monotonic time when
it's available in python 3.3+ or optionally when the library
at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monotonic is installed).

This code comes from taskflow, but oslo.messaging has similar
code that they could replace with this (and I imagine tooz
could also use this); among others...

The volume_create methods used a hardcoded volume_size of 1GB. The
configured volume_size wasn't used on each place. If one used a

error.
This patch replaces all occurrences of the hardcoded volume_size by

openstackclient needs a bit richer support for api version defaults.
Namely, it knows what defaults it wants to have - but we need to do
defaults processing in os-client-config to get sequencing correct. So
provide an API call to set new defaults that can be used before config
processing. Also, flesh out the dict of known default values with good

Currently server resize command has a verify argument for user to

Presently, the wsgi server allows persist connections hence even after
the response is sent to the client, it doesn't close the client socket
connection.
Because of this problem, the green thread is not released back to the pool.

In order to close the client socket connection explicitly after the
response is sent and read successfully by the client, you simply have to
set keepalive to False when you create a wsgi server.

Add a parameter to take advantage of the new(ish) eventlet socket timeout
behaviour. Allows closing idle client connections after a period of
time, eg:

$ time nc localhost 8776
real    1m0.063s

Setting 'client_socket_timeout = 0' means do not timeout.

DocImpact:
Added wsgi_keep_alive option (default=True).
Added client_socket_timeout option (default=0).

Conflicts:
        nova/tests/unit/test_wsgi.py

Note: The required unit-tests are manually added to the below path,
as new path for unit-tests is not present in stable/icehouse release.
nova/tests/compute/test_host_api.py

This patch is not 1:1 cherry-pick, I have changed the default value
of client_socket_timeout to 0, as per the policy for changes to
stable branches.

With the recent refactoring in Neutron, the router creation logic has
changed. This modifies the VPNaaS repo unit tests to be compatible
with these changes. Reference review 147744, which is approved and
awaiting merge.

Note: There were two tests which were testing DVR, but were calling
a router vs a DVR. Didn't seem to affect the test done, however, but
fixed.

Previously using the ClearRequestContext fixture only reset contexts
on fixture teardown. If *all* tests in a test suite use this fixture,
this is fine. However if any tests do not, it means you might start
with a carry over context from previous tests.

Using this fixture means you really wanted a clean slate, so fix it so
that you get a clean state when you get started as well as when you
finish.

It is not clear why this is a configurable option. The original
blueprint just wanted the ability to specify a policy.d infrastructure
to make complex policies easier to enforce. There was no requirement
on it being configurable.

Being configurable just exposes another way in which incompatibilities
in OpenStack projects might be able to emerge. As this merged late in
the incubator lifecycle for the policy code, there are likely few/no
existing users of the option so it should be safe to deprecate it
for the library.  That way we won't break anyone currently using it,
and don't have to commit to supporting it going forward.

Creates classes representing the 3 types of namespaces handled by the L3 agent:
router, snat and fip.

The scope of this change is:

- Creation and deletion methods are provided for each namespace class
- Creation and deletion of router and snat namespaces are moved to the router
  classes. These namespaces are now members of the corresponding router class
- Invocation of Fip namespace creation and deletion is left in the agent, since
  the agent owns it
- A context manager is provided to move the namespaces (router and snat)

A follow up patchset will add methods to create and delete interfaces in the
namespaces. These methods are intended to be used by the router classes

In particular: * `Endpoints & Versioning`_ - Brief discussion about Barbican's approach to service URIs. * `Secrets Resource`_ - Details storing, retrieving and deleting secrets. * `Orders Resource`_ - Details the ordering facilities for Barbican, used to generate secrets asynchronously. * `Containers Resource`_ - Details storing, retrieving and deleting containers. * `Consumers Resource`_ - Details adding, removing and listing consumers associated with container instances. * `Examples`_ - Provides specific examples utilizing the secrets and orders API. Endpoints & Versioning ====================== The barbican service is assumed to be hosted on an SSL enabled, geographically labelled endpoint. An example for a valid URI might look like the following: https://dfw.secrets.api.rackspacecloud.com Versioning will be achieved through a URI constant element, as shown in the example below: https://dfw.secrets.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1/ Regarding Role Based Access Control (RBAC) of Resources ======================================================= Resource access in Barbican is subject to RBAC constraints, as detailed in `this link`_. RBAC failures will result in a 403 Forbidden response. .. _`this link`: https://github.com/cloudkeep/barbican/wiki/Role-Based-Access-Control Secrets Resource ================ The secrets resource is the heart of the Barbican service. It provides access to the secret / keying material stored in the system. The secret scheme represents the actual secret or key that will be presented to the application. Secrets can be of several formats, but additional functionality may be available for known types of symmetric or asymmetric keys. The schema for storing a secret differs from the retrieval schema is shown next. Storing Secrets --------------- Secrets can be stored in two ways: Via POST including a payload ('one step' secret storage), or with a POST without a payload followed by a PUT ('two step' secret storage). Note that the POST calls create secret _metadata_. If the payload is provided with the POST call, then it is encrypted and stored, and then linked with this metadata. Otherwise, a follow-on PUT call provides this payload. Hence clients must provide the secret information payload to store via these operations. This should not be confused with the secret 'generation' process via the `orders` resource below, whereby Barbican generates the secret information payload on clients' behalf. POST ~~~~ Below is an example of a `secret` POST request that includes a payload. .. code-block:: javascript POST v1/secrets Header: content-type=application/json X-Project-Id: {project_id} { ""name"": ""AES key"", ""expiration"": ""2014-02-28T19:14:44.180394"", ""algorithm"": ""aes"", ""bit_length"": 256, ""mode"": ""cbc"", ""payload"": ""gF6+lLoF3ohA9aPRpt+6bQ=="", ""payload_content_type"": ""application/octet-stream"", ""payload_content_encoding"": ""base64"", ""secret_type"": ""opaque"" } Where: * **name** - (optional) Human readable name for the secret. If a name is not supplied, the UUID will be displayed for this field on subsequent GET calls (see below). * **expiration** - (optional) The expiration date for the secret in ISO-8601 format. Once the secret has expired, it will no longer be returned by the API or agent. If this field is not supplied, then the secret has no expiration date. * **algorithm** - (optional) The algorithm type used to generate the secret. _Barbican does not attempt to validate the information provided here, as it is client/application specific._ * **bit_length** - (optional) The bit-length of the secret. Must be an integer one or greater. *Barbican does not attempt to validate the information provided here, as it is client/application specific.* * **mode** - (optional) The type/mode of the algorithm associated with the secret information. _Barbican does not attempt to validate the information provided here, as it is client/application specific._ * **payload** - (optional) The secret's unencrypted plain text. If provided, this field's value must be non-empty, and you must also provide the `payload_content_type`. This field can be omitted allowing for the secret information to be provided via a subsequent PUT call (see below)._ * **payload_content_type** - (optional) The type/format the secret data is provided in. Required if `payload` is specified. Supported values are: * _""text/plain""_ - Used to store plain text secrets. * Other options are _""text/plain; charset=utf-8""_. If charset is omitted, utf-8 will be assumed. * Note that some types are normalized before being stored as secret meta-data, such as converting ""text/plain; charset=utf-8"" to ""text/plain"". *Hence retrieved meta-data may not exactly match what was specified in the POST or PUT calls*. * payload_content_encoding must **not** be specified when payload_content_type is _""text/plain""_ * _""application/octet-stream""_ - Used to store binary secrets from a base64 encoded payload. If this value is used, you must also include the content encoding. * **payload_content_encoding** - (optional) The _encoding_ format used to provide the payload data. Barbican might translate and store the secret data into another format. _Required if `payload_content_type` is ""application/octet-stream""._ Supported values are: * _""base64""_ - Used to specify base64 encoded payloads. * **secret_type** - (optional) Used to indicate the type of secret being stored. If no value is given, `opaque` is used as the default, which is used to signal Barbican to just store the information without worrying about format or encoding. Options for this value are `symmetric`, `public`, `private`, `passphrase`, `certificate`, `opaque`. If the `payload` is not provided, only the secret metadata will be retrievable from Barbican and any attempt to retrieve decrypted data for that secret will fail. Deferring the secret information to a PUT request is useful for secrets that are in binary format and are not suitable for base64 encoding. If the Content-Type in the HTTP header is not set to ""application/json"" then the POST call will fail with an HTTP 415 error. If the POST call succeeds, a URI to the new secret will be provided such as per the example below: .. code-block:: javascript { ""secret_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets/a8957047-16c6-4b05-ac57-8621edd0e9ee"" } PUT ~~~ To provide secret information after the secret's metadata is add, clients would send a PUT request to the secret URI. Note that **a PUT request can only be performed once after a POST call that does not include a payload**. Also note that no other attributes of a secret can be modified via PUT after it is POST-ed (i.e. secrets are immutable). The PUT request must include the appropriate Content-Type and Content-Encoding definitions. (see Examples below for more information.) Retrieving Secrets ------------------ Secrets are comprised of metadata about the secret (algorithm, bit-length, etc.) and encrypted payload data associated with the secret. Hence the API supports retrieving either a secret's metadata or its decrypted data. GET - Individual Secret - Metadata Only ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ GET requests for a `secret` with an `Accept` header set to `application/json` will return a response such as the one below. Only metadata about the secret is returned, rather than the decrypted secret information itself. This allows for a more rapid response for large secrets, or large lists of secrets, as well as accommodating multi-part secrets such as SSL certificates, which may have both a public and private key portions that could be individually retrieved. An example GET call for an individual secret is below. .. code-block:: javascript GET v1/secrets/888b29a4-c7cf-49d0-bfdf-bd9e6f26d718 Headers: X-Project-Id: {project_id} { ""status"": ""ACTIVE"", ""secret_type"": ""symmetric"", ""updated"": ""2013-06-28T15:23:33.092660"", ""name"": ""AES key"", ""algorithm"": ""AES"", ""mode"": ""cbc"", ""bit_length"": 256, ""content_types"": { ""default"": ""application/octet-stream"" }, ""expiration"": ""2013-05-08T16:21:38.134160"", ""secret_ref"": ""http://localhost:8080/v1/secrets/888b29a4-c7cf-49d0-bfdf-bd9e6f26d718"", } Where: * **secret_type** - See POST example above. * **name** - Human readable name for the secret. If a name was not provided during the POST call above, then its UUID is returned. * **algorithm** - See POST example above. * **mode** - See POST example above. * **bit_length** - See POST example above. * **content_types** - Available content mime types for the format of the decrypted secret. For example, SSL certificates may have both 'public' (for public key) and 'private' (for private key) types available. * *This value is only shown if a secret has encrypted data associated with it.* * Note that some types are normalized, such as converting ""text/plain; charset=utf-8"" to ""text/plain"". *Hence retrieved meta-data may not exactly match what was specified in the POST or PUT calls*. * **expiration** - UTC time when the secret will expire. Attempting to retrieve a secret after the expiration date will result in an error. * **secret_ref** - Self URI to the secret. GET - List of Secrets Per Project ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Performing a GET on the secrets resource with no UUID retrieves a batch of the most recent secrets (metadata only) per the requesting project, as per the example response below. The `limit` and `offset` parameters are used to control pagination of the secrets list, as described after this example. .. code-block:: javascript GET http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets?limit=3&offset=2 Headers: X-Project-Id: {project_id} { ""secrets"": [ { ""status"": ""ACTIVE"", ""secret_type"": ""symmetric"", ""updated"": ""2013-06-28T15:23:30.668641"", ""mode"": ""cbc"", ""name"": ""Main Encryption Key"", ""algorithm"": ""AES"", ""created"": ""2013-06-28T15:23:30.668619"", ""secret_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets/e171bb2d-f14f-433e-84f0-3dfcac7a7311"", ""expiration"": ""2014-06-28T15:23:30.668619"", ""bit_length"": 256, ""content_types"": { ""default"": ""application/octet-stream"" } }, { ""status"": ""ACTIVE"", ""secret_type"": ""symmetric"", ""updated"": ""2013-06-28T15:23:32.210474"", ""mode"": ""cbc"", ""name"": ""Backup Key"", ""algorithm"": ""AES"", ""created"": ""2013-06-28T15:23:32.210467"", ""secret_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets/6dba7827-c232-4a2b-8f3d-f523ca3a3f99"", ""expiration"": null, ""bit_length"": 256, ""content_types"": { ""default"": ""application/octet-stream"" } }, { ""status"": ""ACTIVE"", ""secret_type"": ""passphrase"" ""updated"": ""2013-06-28T15:23:33.092660"", ""mode"": null, ""name"": ""PostgreSQL admin password"", ""algorithm"": null, ""created"": ""2013-06-28T15:23:33.092635"", ""secret_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets/6dfa448d-c35a-4158-abaf-e4c249efb580"", ""expiration"": null, ""bit_length"": null, ""content_types"": { ""default"": ""text/plain"" } } ], ""next"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets?limit=3&offset=5"", ""previous"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets?limit=3&offset=0"" } The retrieved list of secrets is ordered by oldest to newest `created` date. The URL parameters (`?limit=3&offset=2` in this example) provide a way to window or page the retrieved list, with the `offset` representing how many records to skip before retrieving the list, and the `limit` representing the maximum number of records retrieved (up to `100`). If the parameters are not provided, then up to `10` records are retrieved. To access any records before the retrieved list, the 'previous' link is provided. The 'next' link can be used to retrieve records after the current list. GET - Decrypted Secret Data ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ To retrieve the decrypted secret information, perform a GET with the `Accept` header set to one of the `content_types` specified in the GET metadata call. Note that even if a binary secret is provided in the `base64` format, it is converted to binary by Barbican prior to encryption and storage. _Thereafter the secret will only be decrypted and returned as raw binary._ See examples below for more info.

The ordering object encapsulates the workflow and history for the creation of a secret. This interface is implemented as an asynchronous process since the time to generate a secret can vary depending on the type of secret. POST ---- An example of an `orders` POST request is below. .. code-block:: javascript POST v1/orders Header: content-type=application/json X-Project-Id: {project_id} { ""type"": ""key"", ""meta"": { ""name"": ""secretname"", ""algorithm"": ""AES"", ""bit_length"": 256, ""mode"": ""cbc"", ""payload_content_type"": ""application/octet-stream"" } } Where the elements of the `meta` element match those of the `secret` POST request above, but without the `payload` attributes. _Note however that unlike with the `secrets` resource, the `algorithm`, `bit_length` and `mode` attributes are validated, to ensure that a secret can be generated per these specifications._ The `type` parameter selects the secret to generate: `key` generates a symmetric key; `asymmetric` generates a public/private PKI key pair (in a Container object); certificate` generates an SSL certificate (not currently operational). If the Content-Type in the HTTP header is not set to ""application/json"" then the POST call will fail with an HTTP 415 error. PUT --- Currently nothing can be edited in an order. GET - Individual Order ---------------------- GET requests for an `order` will return a response such as in the example below. .. code-block:: javascript GET v1/orders/{order_id} Headers: X-Project-Id: {project_id} { ""type"": ""key"", ""meta"": { ""name"": ""secretname"", ""algorithm"": ""aes"", ""bit_length"": 256, ""mode"": ""cbc"", ""payload_content_type"": ""application/octet-stream"" }, ""order_ref"": ""http://localhost:8080/v1/orders/f9b633d8-fda5-4be8-b42c-5b2c9280289e"", ""secret_ref"": ""http://localhost:8080/v1/secrets/888b29a4-c7cf-49d0-bfdf-bd9e6f26d718"", ""status"": ""ERROR"", ""error_status_code"": ""400 Bad Request"", ""error_reason"": ""Secret creation issue seen - content-encoding of 'bogus' not supported."" } Where: * **meta** - Secret parameters provided in the original order request. _Note that this is not the same as retrieving a Secret resource per the `secrets` resource, so elements such as a secret's `content_types` will not be displayed. To see such details, perform a GET on the `secret_ref`._ * **type** - Secret type in the original order request. * **order_ref** - URI to this order. * **status** - Status of the order, one of PENDING, ACTIVE or ERROR. Clients should poll the order for a status change to ACTIVE (in which case `secret_ref` has the secret details) or ERROR (in which case `error_reason` has the error reason, and 'error_status_code' has an HTTP-style status code). * **secret_ref** - URI to the secret *once it is generated*. This field is not available unless the status is ACTIVE. * **error_status_code** - (optional) HTTP-style status code of the root cause error condition, only if status is ERROR. * **error_reason** - (optional) Details of the root cause error condition, only if status is ERROR. GET - List of Orders Per Project -------------------------------- Performing a GET on the orders resource with no UUID retrieves a batch of the most recent orders per the requesting project, as per the example response below. The `limit` and `offset` parameters function similar to the GET secrets list detailed above. .. code-block:: javascript GET http://localhost:9311/v1/orders?limit=3&offset=2 Headers: X-Project-Id: {project_id} { ""orders"": [ { ""status"": ""ACTIVE"", ""secret_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets/bf2b33d5-5347-4afb-9009-b4597f415b7f"", ""updated"": ""2013-06-28T18:29:37.058718"", ""created"": ""2013-06-28T18:29:36.001750"", ""type"": ""key"", ""meta"": { ""name"": ""secretname"", ""algorithm"": ""aes"", ""bit_length"": 256, ""mode"": ""cbc"", ""payload_content_type"": ""application/octet-stream"" }, ""order_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/orders/3100078a-6ab1-4c3f-ab9f-295938c91733"" }, { ""status"": ""ACTIVE"", ""secret_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets/fa71b143-f10e-4f7a-aa82-cc292dc33eb5"", ""updated"": ""2013-06-28T18:29:37.058718"", ""created"": ""2013-06-28T18:29:36.001750"", ""type"": ""key"", ""meta"": { ""name"": ""secretname"", ""algorithm"": ""aes"", ""bit_length"": 256, ""mode"": ""cbc"", ""payload_content_type"": ""application/octet-stream"" }, ""order_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/orders/30b3758a-7b8e-4f2c-b9f0-f590c6f8cc6d"" } ] } The retrieved list of orders is ordered by oldest to newest `created` date.

There are currently three types of containers (""generic"", ""rsa"", and ""certificate""). Generic type containers can hold multiple references to secrets, each reference defining a relation name to the secret. RSA type containers can hold 3 secret references, named 'public_key', 'private_key', and 'private_key_passphrase'. Certificate type containers must hold a 'certificate', but may optionally hold any or all of 'private_key', 'private_key_passphrase', and 'intermediates'. POST ---- Below is an example of a `container` POST request. .. code-block:: javascript POST v1/containers Header: content-type=application/json { ""name"": ""container name"", ""type"": ""rsa"", ""secret_refs"": [ { ""name"": ""private_key"", ""secret_ref"":""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets/05a47308-d045-43d6-bfe3-1dbcd0c3a97b"" }, { ""name"": ""public_key"", ""secret_ref"":""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets/05a47308-d045-43d6-bfe3-1dbcd0c3a97b"" }, { ""name"": ""private_key_passphrase"", ""secret_ref"":""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets/05a47308-d045-43d6-bfe3-1dbcd0c3a97b"" } ] } Where: * **name** - (optional) Human readable name for the container. If a name is not supplied, the UUID will be displayed for this field on subsequent GET calls (see below). * **type** - The type of the container. Type can be ""generic"", ""rsa"", or ""certificate"". The ""generic"" type containers can store multiple arbitrary named references to secrets; ""rsa"" type can store 3 references, one each named ""public_key"", ""private_key"" and ""private_key_passphrase""; ""certificate"" type must hold a ""certificate"", but may optionally hold any or all of ""private_key"", ""private_key_passphrase"", and ""intermediates"". * **secret_refs** - (optional) Array of secret references. If the POST call succeeds, a URI to the new container will be provided such as per the example below: .. code-block:: javascript { ""container_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/containers/a8957047-16c6-4b05-ac57-8621edd0e9ee"" } If the Content-Type in the HTTP header is not set to ""application/json"" then the POST call will fail with an HTTP 415 error. PUT --- Currently nothing can be edited in a container resource. GET - Individual Container -------------------------- GET requests for a container will return a response such as in the example below .. code-block:: javascript GET v1/containers/888b29a4-c7cf-49d0-bfdf-bd9e6f26d718 { ""name"":""rsa container"", ""secret_refs"":[ { ""secret_ref"":""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets/059805d5-b400-47da-abc5-cae7286d3ede"", ""name"":""private_key_passphrase"" }, { ""secret_ref"":""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets/28704f0f-3273-40d4-bc40-4de2691135ea"", ""name"":""private_key"" }, { ""secret_ref"":""http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets/29d89344-10ad-4f92-8aa2-adebaf7556ee"", ""name"":""public_key"" } ], ""container_ref"":""http://localhost:9311/v1/containers/888b29a4-c7cf-49d0-bfdf-bd9e6f26d718"", ""type"":""rsa"" } Where: * **name** - Human readable name for the container. If a name was not provided during the POST call above, then its UUID is returned. * **type** - Type of the container. * **container_ref** - Self URI to the container. * **secret_refs** - Array of named secret references. GET - List of Containers Per Project ------------------------------------ Performing a GET on the containers resource with no UUID retrieves a batch of the most recent containers per the requesting project, as per the example response below. The `limit` and `offset` parameters function similar to the GET secrets list detailed above. .. code-block:: javascript GET http://localhost:9311/v1/containers?limit=3&offset=2 Headers: X-Project-Id: {project_id} { ""total"":42, ""containers"":[ { ""status"":""ACTIVE"", ""updated"":""2014-02-11T18:05:58.909411"", ""name"":""generic container_updated"", ""secret_refs"":[ { ""secret_id"":""123"", ""name"":""private_key"" }, { ""secret_id"":""321"", ""name"":""public_key"" }, { ""secret_id"":""456"", ""name"":""private_key_passphrase"" } ], ""created"":""2014-02-11T18:05:58.909403"", ""container_ref"":""http://localhost:9311/v1/containers/d4e06015-4f6e-4626-ac3d-4ece6621f96d"", ""type"":""rsa"" }, { ""status"":""ACTIVE"", ""updated"":""2014-02-11T18:08:58.160557"", ""name"":""generic container_updated"", ""secret_refs"":[ { ""secret_id"":""321"", ""name"":""public_key"" }, { ""secret_id"":""456"", ""name"":""private_key_passphrase"" } ], ""created"":""2014-02-11T18:08:58.160551"", ""container_ref"":""http://localhost:9311/v1/containers/bb24fa61-0b5f-4d40-8990-846e95cd7b12"", ""type"":""rsa"" }, { ""status"":""ACTIVE"", ""updated"":""2014-02-11T18:25:58.198072"", ""name"":""generic container_updated"", ""secret_refs"":[ { ""secret_id"":""1df433d6-c2d4-480d-90fb-0bfd9c5da3dd"", ""name"":""private_key"" }, { ""secret_id"":""321"", ""name"":""public_key"" }, { ""secret_id"":""456"", ""name"":""private_key_passphrase"" } ], ""created"":""2014-02-11T18:25:58.198063"", ""container_ref"":""http://localhost:9311/v1/containers/38f58696-5013-4bd6-ab2b-fbea41dc957a"", ""type"":""rsa"" }, { ""status"":""ACTIVE"", ""updated"":""2014-02-11T18:44:06.296957"", ""name"":""generic container_updated"", ""secret_refs"":[ { ""secret_id"":""1df433d6-c2d4-480d-90fb-0bfd9c5da3dd"", ""name"":""private_key"" }, { ""secret_id"":""321"", ""name"":""public_key"" }, { ""secret_id"":""456"", ""name"":""private_key_passphrase"" } ], ""created"":""2014-02-11T18:44:06.296947"", ""container_ref"":""http://localhost:9311/v1/containers/a8d1adfd-0d36-4eb0-8762-99787eb4a7ff"", ""type"":""rsa"" } ], ""next"":""http://localhost:9311/v1/containers?limit=10&offset=10"" } The retrieved list of containers is ordered by oldest to newest `created` date. The URL parameters (`?limit=3&offset=2` in this example) provide a way to window or page the retrieved list, with the `offset` representing how many records to skip before retrieving the list, and the `limit` representing the maximum number of records retrieved (up to `100`). If the parameters are not provided, then up to `10` records are retrieved. To access any records before the retrieved list, the 'previous' link is provided. The 'next' link can be used to retrieve records after the current list.

Clients can then query containers for the consumers that registered interest in them. Client workflows could use this list (for example) to warn of attempts to remove containers that have registered consumers. Note that Barbican allows containers to be deleted even if there are registered consumers for them. POST ---- An example of an `consumers` POST request is below. .. code-block:: javascript POST v1/containers/888b29a4-c7cf-49d0-bfdf-bd9e6f26d718/consumers Header: content-type=application/json X-Project-Id: {project_id} { ""name"": ""foo-service"", ""URL"": ""https://www.fooservice.com/widgets/1234"" } Where the `name` is typically the name of the remote service registering as a consumer for this container instance, and 'URL' is typically a URL to a resource in the remote service that utilizes the container's secrets somehow, such as a load balancer that has a container's SSL certificate installed onto it. Note that subsequent POSTs to the same container instance with the same `name` attribute will replace the previous URL registered for that `name`. GET - List of Consumers Per Container Instance ---------------------------------------------- **Note: This feature seems to be broken currently, by not displaying the navigation links per the example below.** Performing a GET on a specific container resource returns a list of consumers that registered with it. The `limit` and `offset` parameters function similar to the GET secrets list detailed above. .. code-block:: javascript GET http://localhost:9311/v1/containers/888b29a4-c7cf-49d0-bfdf-bd9e6f26d718/consumers?limit=3&offset=2 Headers: X-Project-Id: {project_id} { ""consumers"": [ { ""name"": ""foo-service"", ""URL"": ""https://www.fooservice.com/widgets/1234"" }, { ""name"": ""barService"", ""URL"": ""https://www.barservice.com/mythings/5678"" } ], ""next"":""http://localhost:9311/v1/containers/888b29a4-c7cf-49d0-bfdf-bd9e6f26d718/consumers?limit=10&offset=10"" } The retrieved list of consumers is ordered by oldest to newest `created` date. Consumers Summary ----------------- > https://.../v1/containers/<container-UUID>/consumers +--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Method | Description | +========+===================================================================+ | GET | Returns a list of all consumers registered for a container. | +--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+ | POST | Registers/adds consumer information to a container. | +--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+ | DELETE | Removes a registered consumer by specifying its `name` and `URL` | | | in the JSON payload. | +--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+ Examples ======== The following are example combinations, inspired by `this page`_. .. _`this page`: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11946920/http-content-negotiation-compression-use-base64-with-accept-encoding-content-en The tables in this section are focused on the content-types and content-encodings of the various REST verb flows, even though each flow might have a different way to specify these values (either via http header settings or JSON request field). The reason for this approach is that while each flow has a different means to specify the mime-type and encoding, the values set for them must still be consistent with valid mime-type or encoding selections.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Reliable quota enforcement ========================================== Launchpad: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/better-quotas Enforce network resource quotas in a reliable and efficient way, without changing the quota API interface. Problem Description =================== Quotas enforcement is a relatively simple task. When a request for creating one or more resources is received, the available resource quota is checked, and if the request cannot be satisfied an error is returned to the user. This works perfectly under the assumption that API requests are served serially. Unfortunately, this assumption is not true when multiple REST API workers are employed. The same applies also if there is a single API worker, but multiple API servers are operating behind a load balancer. In these conditions, two or more concurrent requests can pass quota enforcement even if there is not enough quota avaiable to accept all of them. For instance, assume there are 2 REST API workers and the current quota usage is Nmax - 1 where Nmax is the resource quota. Two requests are then sent and dispatched to the workers. Each worker enforces the quota before the other worker completes processing the API request. Both requests are accepted, leading to a overall resource usage of Nmax + 1 Therefore, leveraging multiple workers and bulk creates, a tenant could in theory create up to Nmax * Nworkers resources. While this is unlikely to happen, there is still a good chance that tenants could manage to use more resources then those they've been assigned by the cloud provider. This situation is far from ideal both for the cloud provider and the user, as the former might end up in a situation where data center resources are oversubscribed, whereas the latter could be billed more than expected. For RPC API workers instead, quotas are not enforced at all. This implies that quotas are not enfroced for resources created via RPC, usually ""internal"" ports. While not enforcing quotas for service ports such as DHCP ports might be a desired thing, this is probably not the correct behaviour. Indeed these ports will still contribute to the overall usage upon enforcement for REST API requests. A brief investigation revealed that these problems does not affect Neutron only. Other projects, such as Nova or Glance, are exposed to quota over booking as well. Proposed Change =============== Add a concepts of 'resource booking'. Whenever a quota enforcement check is successful, mark the requested amount of resources as 'booked' immediately. The booking shall be removed as soon as the corresponding API operation is completed, successfully or not. This will be ideally done upon return from the plugin call. Multiple bookings can exist at anytime for the same tenant and the same resource. The quota check should add all the existing bookings to the current usage count. Even with resource bookings, there still is a race condition which can occur if a worker performs the quota check before the others enter their bookings. Resource booking should therefore be serialized. DB integrity constraints can be used to this aim, without recurring to locking queries. This can be achieved by introducing a table specificaly aimed at keeping track of bookings in progress. The resource booking process will therefore look as it follows: 1) LOCK BOOKING FACILITY Write down in an appropriate DB table, say booking_locks, that a given worker is attempting to book a give resource for some tenant. *---------------------------------------* | RESOURCE_TYPE | TENANT_ID | LOCKED_BY | (all fields constitute PK) *---------------|-----------|-----------* | network | xxx | worker_0 | *---------------------------------------* 2) Commit transaction to the DB. This will trigger an integrity violation error if another worker attempts to make another booking for the same tenant and resource type. 3) DO BOOKING Record the booking in an approriate table *--------------------------------------------* | RESOURCE_TYPE | TENANT_ID | BOOKING_AMOUNT | *---------------|-----------|----------------* | network | xxx | 2 | *--------------------------------------------* 4) RELEASE BOOKING LOCK 5) Commit transaction to the DB. This will allow other workers to attempt their bookings. Example: worker 0 worker 1 ---------- ---------- acquire_lock_booking acquire_lock_booking COMMIT - SUCCESS COMMIT - FAIL (INTEGRITY VIOLATION) do_booking RETRY release_lock_booking COMMIT - FAIL (INTEGRITY VIOLATION) COMMIT - SUCCESS RETRY - do_booking - COMMIT - SUCCESS - release_lock_booking - COMMIT - SUCCESS The table for locking bookings acts as a centralized lock, leveragin only primary keys, which are correcly enforced even in active/active clusters. While this specification is specifically aimed at Neutron, its deliverables could be transformed into a oslo library with relative ease. This would be the goal of a subsquent blueprint. Data Model Impact ----------------- This specifciation introduces two tables: Table name: bookings Attributes: resource_type string tenant_id string booking_amount integer Table name: booking_locks resource_type string tenant_id string locked_by string all attributes will be part of the primary key. REST API Impact --------------- No impact on the API interface. This specification will however slightly change the way in which resource usage is calculated. Indeed service ports, such as router interface and DHCP ports, won't count anymore towards the overall resource usage. This also fixes a little discrepancy in the current neutron implementation. For instance, when a router interface the quota for the router port is not checked. However, when a compute port is created, router interface ports are calculated in resource usage. Security Impact --------------- The proposed change should not open any vulnerability which could lead to DoS, leaking tenant information, or allowing attackers to plug into other tenant's networks. All the DB queries performed in the implementation of this specification will be scoped by tenant, and built in a way to prevent SQL injection. Notifications Impact -------------------- None. Other End User Impact --------------------- Please see notes on usage calculations in the 'REST API impact' section. Performance Impact ------------------ Some additional DB operations will be performed upon quota enforcement. This change also end up serializing resources which were previously processed in parallel. While the overall performance impact is expected to be negligible, it will be important to evaluate it upon code review. There is also an interesting question pertaining resource usage. It is indeed worth exploring whether it is better to count it everytime or updating the a usage counter everytime resources are created or deleted. To this aim one sould compare the cost of SELECT queries vs the cost of adding db hooks on resource create/delete and performing the corresponding UPDATE query. The gain/loss in terms of performance depends on relative frequency of GET operations vs POST/DELETE operations. Update is definetely more expensive, but SELECT are way more frequent. However, it should be possible to implement this specification leaving resource usage calculation unchanged, and then perhaps come back to it in the future. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- As service ports are not anymore counted in resource usage, deployers might expect in theory an increase in port usage. This increase should however be contained if one considers ports are tipically used with instances, and the enforcement criteria for instances are not being altered by this specification. Developer Impact ---------------- The implementation for this specification will come with adequate developer documentation. Community Impact ---------------- None, I don't think so... but one can never know. Alternatives ------------ One alternative definetely worth considering is to us a single table for managing bookings. While the tuple (resource_type, tenant_id, resource_amount) cannot be reliably used as a primary key for serializing bookings among workers, the ""locked_by"" attribute can be added to this table and the following tuple can constitute the primary key: (resource_type, tenant_id, locked_by) When committing the booking the locked_by value would be erased and this will allow other workers to make their booking. Nevertheless, this solution does not appear to bring benefits in terms of performance and scalability, and also makes the code less readable. Even if it would be possible to use locking queries (ie: SELECT .. FOR UPDATE) statements, this solution has already proved not ideal, and will also miserably fail with some DB backends if active/active replication is employed. Another alternative would consist in a separate quota granting authority. Thi is a possibility, and that is what the 'blazar' resource reservation project advocates for, but might result in an overkill for many OpensStack deployments. Finally, this problem can also be solved by introducing a distributed lock amond API workers. memcached or zookeper could be used with relative ease to implement this sort of distributed coordination. Nevertheless, there is probably no need to resort to distributed coordination if the problem can be solved just leveraging DB integrity. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- salv-orlando Work Items ---------- 1) Prelimary yak shaving - refactor existing quota module 2) Add resource booking logic and use them in quota enforcement 3) Remove service ports from quota enforcement 4) Further optional yak shaving for ""libraryzing"" the quota module The latter than would be in preparation of moving the quota enforcement module to the oslo incubator. Dependencies ============ The big dependencies for this change could be the following: 1) removal of self-grown WSGI framework and subsequent switch to pecan 2) review of the plugin interface. While the above work items have definetely a bearing on the quota enforcement points, they won't change the logic of the quota enforcement module, which\ can therefore be implemented orthogonally. Testing ======= Tempest Tests ------------- None. This specification does not change the API interface nor any change which might have an impact on the integrated gate. Functional Tests ---------------- Appropriate functional tests will be added to validate correct quota enforcement. As a proper verification will require triggering the race condition, some sort of fault injection might be needed. The need and feasibility of this will be evaluated separately. API Tests --------- No further API test is needed. Documentation Impact ==================== User Documentation ------------------ Document that service ports won't count anymore in the overall resource usage. Developer Documentation ----------------------- As there is currently no developer documentation for quotas, this is rather easy: ""do developer documentation for the quota enforcement module"" References ========== None.

When an image is deleted, the image data is not being deleted
completely if it is stored as static large object(SLO). Only the
manifest is deleted leaving behind all the segments. This leads to
stale data in swift cluster.

This change attempts to delete the SLO in the following way:
 1. Identify a SLO with 'x-static-large-object' header on an object
 2. Delete the SLO, both manifest and the segments, using the
 query string 'multipart-manifest=delete' while deleting the object

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Example Spec - The title of your blueprint ========================================== Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/example Introduction paragraph -- why are we doing anything? A single paragraph of prose that operators can understand. Some notes about using this template: * Your spec should be in ReSTructured text, like this template. * Please wrap text at 79 columns. * The filename in the git repository should match the launchpad URL, for example a URL of: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/awesome-thing should be named awesome-thing.rst * Please do not delete any of the sections in this template. If you have nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None * For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html * To test out your formatting, build the docs using tox, or see: http://rst.ninjs.org * If you would like to provide a diagram with your spec, ascii diagrams are required. http://asciiflow.com/ is a very nice tool to assist with making ascii diagrams. The reason for this is that the tool used to review specs is based purely on plain text. Plain text will allow review to proceed without having to look at additional files which can not be viewed in gerrit. It will also allow inline feedback on the diagram itself. Problem description =================== A detailed description of the problem: * For a new feature this might be use cases. Ensure you are clear about the actors in each use case: End User vs Deployer * For a major reworking of something existing it would describe the problems in that feature that are being addressed. Proposed change =============== Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How do you propose to solve this problem? If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In other words, what's the scope of this effort? Alternatives ------------ What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one. Data model impact ----------------- Changes which require modifications to the data model often have a wider impact on the system. The community often has strong opinions on how the data model should be evolved, from both a functional and performance perspective. It is therefore important to capture and gain agreement as early as possible on any proposed changes to the data model. Questions which need to be addressed by this section include: * What new data objects and/or database schema changes is this going to require? * What database migrations will accompany this change. * How will the initial set of new data objects be generated, for example if you need to take into account existing instances, or modify other existing data describe how that will work. REST API impact --------------- Each API method which is either added or changed should have the following * Specification for the method * A description of what the method does suitable for use in user documentation * Method type (POST/PUT/GET/DELETE) * Normal http response code(s) * Expected error http response code(s) * A description for each possible error code should be included describing semantic errors which can cause it such as inconsistent parameters supplied to the method, or when an instance is not in an appropriate state for the request to succeed. Errors caused by syntactic problems covered by the JSON schema defintion do not need to be included. * URL for the resource * Parameters which can be passed via the url * JSON schema definition for the body data if allowed * JSON schema definition for the response data if any * Example use case including typical API samples for both data supplied by the caller and the response * Discuss any policy changes, and discuss what things a deployer needs to think about when defining their policy. Upgrade impact -------------- If this change set concerns any kind of upgrade process, describe how it is supposed to deal with that stuff. For example, Fuel currently supports upgrading of master node, so it is necessary to describe whether this patch set contradicts upgrade process itself or any working feature that we need to support. Security impact --------------- Describe any potential security impact on the system. Some of the items to consider include: * Does this change touch sensitive data such as tokens, keys, or user data? * Does this change alter the API in a way that may impact security, such as a new way to access sensitive information or a new way to login? * Does this change involve cryptography or hashing? * Does this change require the use of sudo or any elevated privileges? * Does this change involve using or parsing user-provided data? This could be directly at the API level or indirectly such as changes to a cache layer. * Can this change enable a resource exhaustion attack, such as allowing a single API interaction to consume significant server resources? Some examples of this include launching subprocesses for each connection, or entity expansion attacks in XML. For more detailed guidance, please see the OpenStack Security Guidelines as a reference (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/Guidelines). These guidelines are a work in progress and are designed to help you identify security best practices. For further information, feel free to reach out to the OpenStack Security Group at openstack-security@lists.openstack.org. Notifications impact -------------------- Please specify any changes to notifications. Be that an extra notification, changes to an existing notification, or removing a notification. Other end user impact --------------------- Aside from the API, are there other ways a user will interact with this feature? * Does this change have an impact on python-fuelclient? What does the user interface there look like? Performance Impact ------------------ Describe any potential performance impact on the system, for example how often will new code be called, and is there a major change to the calling pattern of existing code. Examples of things to consider here include: * A periodic task might look like a small addition but if it calls conductor or another service the load is multiplied by the number of nodes in the system. * Scheduler filters get called once per host for every instance being created, so any latency they introduce is linear with the size of the system. * A small change in a utility function or a commonly used decorator can have a large impacts on performance. * Calls which result in a database queries (whether direct or via conductor) can have a profound impact on performance when called in critical sections of the code. * Will the change include any locking, and if so what considerations are there on holding the lock? Other deployer impact --------------------- Discuss things that will affect how you deploy and configure Fuel that have not already been mentioned, such as: * What config options are being added? Should they be more generic than proposed? Are the default values ones which will work well in real deployments? * Is this a change that takes immediate effect after its merged, or is it something that has to be explicitly enabled? * If this change is a new binary, how would it be deployed? * Please state anything that those doing continuous deployment, or those upgrading from the previous release, need to be aware of. Also describe any plans to deprecate configuration values or features. For example, if we change the directory name that instances are stored in, how do we handle instance directories created before the change landed? Do we move them? Do we have a special case in the code? Do we assume that the operator will recreate all the instances in their cloud? Developer impact ---------------- Discuss things that will affect other developers working on Fuel, such as: * If the blueprint proposes a change to the driver API, discussion of how drivers would implement the feature is required. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: <launchpad-id or None> Other contributors: <launchpad-id or None> Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Dependencies ============ * Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in fuel, or in other projects, that this one either depends on or is related to. * If this requires functionality of another project that is not currently used by Fuel, document that fact. * Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not included in Fuel? Or does it depend on a specific version of library? Testing ======= Please discuss how the change will be tested. It is assumed that unit test coverage will be added so that doesn't need to be mentioned explicitly, but discussion of why you think unit tests are sufficient and we don't need to add more functional tests would need to be included. Is this untestable in gate given current limitations (specific hardware / software configurations available)? If so, are there mitigation plans (3rd party testing, gate enhancements, etc). Documentation Impact ==================== What is the impact on the docs team of this change? Some changes might require donating resources to the docs team to have the documentation updated. Don't repeat details discussed above, but please reference them here. References ========== Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any reference.

(HeatStack.create_and_delete_stack) is falling because neutron
creates multiple security groups but nova cannot define which one
should it use. As a result nova cannot boot an instance.
The fix defines default security group in the

the one specific group.
In addition, the deprecated attribute network_id in the template
has been replaced with the network attribute.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Semver Utility for DB storage ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/glance/+spec/semver-support Working with versions of various objects is a common problem, which already has a number of market-adopted solutions. One of these solutions is Semantic Versioning - a system of rules and requirements for assigning version numbers to software components and other objects. The specification for this system - known as semver - can be found at [1] It is proposed to create a simple utility class in Glance which implement parts of semver spec for usage by Glance Artifacts and other components. Problem description =================== A common use-case for semantic versioning is ability to compare two or more objects with the version assigned. According to the specification ([1]) objects are compared first by their major versions, then minor versions, then patch versions, also there is a concept of ""pre-release"" versions (alphas, betas, RCs etc) which should always be considered ""lower"" then the ""released"" version with the same values of numeric versions. For example, 1.2.2 < 1.2.3-beta < 1.2.3 If we want to store versioned objects in the catalog (this may be applied to images, artifacts and other entities), then we need to be able to execute this kind of semantic comparison for large amounts of entities. So, the comparison should be made not only in memory, but at the database as well, and there is no generic datatype in modern RDBMs to store this kind of versioning information. So, a workaround should be introduced. Proposed change =============== It is proposed to add a class to store the version information in semver notation which will provide appropriate comparison operations. To be able to sort these semver objects in the database it is required to convert them into some generic comparable data type. It is suggested to use an unsigned long (64 bit integer) values for that purpose. In this case, three numeric components of the version (major, minor and patch) may be stored as a single large number: first 21 bits of this number will be allocated to store major revision, next 21 bits - for minor revision, next 21 bits - for patch revision, and the last - youngest - bit to store a flag indicating if the version have a pre-release tag (like alpha or something) or not: if the tag exists, the bit is set to 0, otherwise - to 1, so the versions with identical major-minor-patch parts will be sorted in correct order: pre-release before the release ones. The labels of pre-release version should be stored independently from the numeric part as a regular string, because - according to the semver spec - they are to be compared according to regular alphanumeric comparison only if the numeric parts of the versions are identical. So, these two values - long number and a string - may be combined into a single composite index in the database, which will provide efficient capabilities to sort and filter objects with the versions assigned. Alternatives ------------ There is an existing python library - semantic_version - on PyPi ([2]) which implements some semver-related functionality. However it does not contain the utility to convert semver to long value, thus it does not fully cover the proposal of this spec. Also, this library is not part of global requirements, so, instead of trying to modify it and then pushing to global-reqs it seems easier to implement the needed functionality from scratch. Another alternative is to implement the same approach in oslo.incubator. It is suggested to first land this feature in Glance and then - if case of wider interest - migrate it nto the Oslo Data model impact ----------------- None: this spec does not cover any actual database changes, it just describes the utility which will allow to operate with semver objects and convert them to data which may be usable for DB storage - and back. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ The proposed change does not affect existing code in any sense. Even more, the suggested implementation will likely use regular expressions to parse semver strings. Python's regexps are quite efficient, especially if precompiled, so no significant performance impacts are expected if the library is used. Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- The usage of the lib should be documented for developers, so they may efficiently use it in their code. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ativelkov Reviewers --------- Core reviewer(s): Erno Kuvaja Other reviewer(s): ivasilevskaya mfedosin Travis Tripp Work Items ---------- Feature is quite simple, may be implemented as a single change set. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= A unit test should be added demonstrating the data structure usage, comparison, string parsing and conversion operation to DB type (long) Documentation Impact ==================== Developers' guide has to be updated to hint the developers on how to properly use the lib in their code.

Implement the auth plugin noted for K2K federation.  The existing
Saml2ScopedToken plugin works for getting a scoped token.

This is marked WIP for 2 reasons:
1)  Unit tests (I'm working this)
2)  I wonder if this should merge in function defined in

so that the API user doesn't have to get the SAML at all.
Instead this plugin could be enhanced to just accept a scoped token
for the IDP, could perform the samlization as well, and return the
unscoped token for the SP.

This tool can extract the useful lines from Astute and Puppet logs
within the Fuel log snapshot or on the live Fuel master node.

usage: fuel_logs [-h] [--astute] [--puppet] [--clear] [--sort] [--evals]
                 [--mcagent] [--less]
                 [SNAPSHOT [SNAPSHOT ...]]

positional arguments:
  SNAPSHOT       Take logs from these snapshots

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --astute, -a   Parse Astute log
  --puppet, -p   Parse Puppet logs
  --clear, -c    Clear the logs on the master node
  --sort, -s     Sort Puppet logs by date
  --evals, -e    Show Puppet evaltrace lines
  --mcagent, -m  Show Astute MCAgent calls debug
  --less, -l     Redirect data to the ""less"" pager

Using anywhere to view Fuel snapshot data:

fuel_logs.py fail_error_deploy_ha_vlan-2015_02_20__20_35_18.tar.gz

Using on the live Fuel Master node:

fuel_logs.py -a View the current Astute log
fuel_logs.py -p View the current Puppet logs

Using without -a and -p options assumes both options

fuel_logs.py -c Truncates Astute and Puppet logs. Respects -a and -p options.

It you are running and debugging many deployments on a single master node
you may want to truncate the logs from the previous deployments. Using -l
option is aslo recomended for interactive use.

The Dell Storage Center driver is failing snapshot creation on
later versions of the Dell REST API.

The doNotExpire option was removed in API 15.3.1.110.  We were
setting this so that the replays are not expired and removed when
Cinder expects them to still be there.  This has been replaced by
setting expiretime to 0.  We were doing this already so the fix
was to simply remove doNotExpire from the REST request payload.

This will fail on every future release of the Dell Storage Center
so this is a critical fix.

X509 certificates are used by Windows for passwordless
authentication (WinRM) in a way which can be considered
consistent with the usage of SSH keys on Linux, as both
are based on public / private keypairs.

Enables nova-api to return the keypair type, updates
nova-api version to reflect the changes and updates the
unit and functional tests to validate the API changes.

Unit tests have been updated to ensure that the keypair
type is not being returned on previous API versions.

Note: x509 keypair implementation is added in the next
commit.

This replaces the current very-limited search by attribute by the full
complex query system we implemented in the indexer.

It's exposed instead as POST /v1/search/resource/<type>.

Currently, we're using a Keystone client which actually performs
auto discovering and returns one of available client. In theory
all works fine, but unfortunately the ""auth_url"" will be replaced
by Keystone with a keystone endpoint. The issue is that this
endpoint may be unavailable if we're working through some
proxy/tunnel and don't have direct access to the fuel master node.

As workaround, we can explicitly create a keystone client for v2.0,
and none of discovering will be performed and the endpoint will not
be replaced implicitly by keystone client.

With MD5Sum checking being added, a concern was brought up that It was
a change with no possibility of reverting to the old behaviour.
This change adds the flag '--ignore-checksum' to the upload subcommand

Changed occurrences of the magic string for a null md5 to use a descriptive
constant instead.

Problem description =================== Currently there is a field in plugin's metadata which looks like: .. code-block:: yaml releases: - os: ubuntu version: 2014.2-6.0 mode: ['ha', 'multinode'] deployment_scripts_path: deployment_scripts/ repository_path: repositories/ubuntu Where ""version"" is a version of Fuel OpenStack release which the plugin is compatibele with. The problem is the plugin will not work for releases with versions 2014.2-6.0.1 and 2014.2.1-6.0. Also user should be able to specify specific minor veresion, because his plugin can have some minor specific hacks. Proposed change =============== OpenStack release in Fuel consists of two parts, ""<openstack version>-<fuel version>"", we will split this version by ""-"" symbol and then get all releases with prefix <openstack version>, and all releases with prefix <fuel version>. For example we have the releases with the next versions * 2014.2-6.0 * 2014.2-6.0.1 * 2014.2.1-6.0 * 2014.2.1-6.0.1 * 2014.2.1-6.0.2 When user specifies **2014.2-6.0** as dependencies, all releases from the list are compatibele with the plugin. When user specifies **2014.2.1-6.0** as dependencies, only next releases are compatibele: * 2014.2.1-6.0.1 * 2014.2.1-6.0.2 When user specifies **2014.2-6.0.1** as dependencies, only next releases are compatibele: * 2014.2-6.0.1 * 2014.2.1-6.0.1 Also user can specify exact version of release which is compatibele with the plugin **2014.2.1-6.0.1** Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Plugin impact ------------- Described above.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============= Plugin groups ============= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/plugin-groups Plugin developer should be able to define what part of the system his plugin implements network, storage, monitoring, or something else, this information can be used for plugins list page generation, also might be useful for Nailgun backend. Problem description =================== Currently to generate plugins page devops team manually adds each plugin in specific group. Proposed change =============== Each plugin have description of groups, groups is a fixed list which can be empty, it can have the next possible options: * network * storage * storage::cinder * storage::glance * monitoring Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- For Nailgun model Plugins json field ""groups"" should be added, in order to store this information. REST API impact --------------- Nailgun should return ""groups"" field from backend. Upgrade impact -------------- By default group is empty, no upgrade impact. Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Plugin impact ------------- Described above. Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: eli@mirantis.com Work Items ---------- * Fix validator and template in Fuel Plugin Builder * Fix Nailgun migration scripts and searilization Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Create a plugin with groups, check that it represented in the database after installation. Documentation Impact ==================== Describe the list of groups. References ========== * https://www.fuel-infra.org/plugins/catalog.html * https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-plugins ",,134,0

Currently neutron-ns-metadata-proxy runs with root permissions when
namespaces are enabled on the dhcp agent because root permissions are
required to ""enter"" in the namespace. But neutron-ns-metadata-proxy
permissions should be reduced as much as possible because it is
reachable from vms.

This change allows to change neutron-ns-metadata-proxy permissions
after its startup through the 2 new options metadata_proxy_user and
metadata_proxy_group which allow to define user/group running metadata
proxy after its initialization. Their default values are
neutron-dhcp-agent effective user and group.

This change delegates metadata proxy management to metadata driver
methods in order to reuse the work already done on l3 agent side.

Permissions drop is done after metadata proxy daemon writes its
pid in its pidfile (it could be disallowed after permissions drop) and
after metadata proxy daemon binds its privileged server port (80).

Using nobody as metadata_proxy_user/group (more secure) is currently
not supported because:

* nobody has not the permission to connect the metadata socket,
* nobody has not the permission to log to file because neutron uses
  WatchedFileHandler (which requires read/write permissions after
  permissions drop).
This limitation will be addressed in a daughter change.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =============================================== Provide programable API to work with Fuel roles =============================================== Problem description =================== Current state of nailgun only allows to create roles by inserting them in nailgun/fixtures/openstack.yaml and create entities based on this description. Such approach can not be considered as extensible and imposes difficulties when user wants to move certain services on to separate nodes (the closest example is ceph-mon which is always installed on controller). Proposed change =============== Current spec proposes to allow user create/update/delete roles by nailgun rest-api and fuel client. Alternatives ------------ Allow creation of new nodes only as a plugin entity. But such approach imposes bad UX experience for anyone who want to solve certain business problems right on environment. Data model impact ----------------- Current role data is splitted over several places. DB model describes only: :: id - unique identifier release_id - id of the role related release name - label of the node (controller, compute) Roles metadata on release model stores: :: name - name that is shown on UI description: description that is shown on UI conditions and limitations of the role several flags that alters role behaviour Volumes metadata on release model stores volumes and allocation strategies for role. Described inconsistencies will not be solved in the scope of this spec. REST API impact --------------- Provide object that is desribed with next schema: :: $schema: http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema# description: Serialized Role object required: [id, name, release_id, meta, volumes] title: Role type: object properties: id: {type: integer} meta: description: {description: Short description of role functionality, type: string} properties: name: {description: Name that will be shown on UI, type: string} required: [name, description] type: object name: {type: string} release_id: {type: integer} volumes: items: description: Volume allocations for role properties: allocate_size: id: {type: string} type: enum: [all, min, full-disk] required: [allocate_size, id] type: object minItems: 1 type: array This object will be served on URIs :: PUT/GET/DELETE /roles/(?P<obj_id>\d+)/ POST/GET /roles/ should atleast support filtering on release_id Upgrade impact -------------- In case database will be migrated into new state - added roles should be migrated as well. Security impact --------------- No impact Notifications impact -------------------- No impact Other end user impact --------------------- CLI commands will be added to work with API: Get list of all roles: :: fuel role name | id | release_id controller | 1 | 1 Save full role information to file :: fuel role --role 1 --file some Create role from file :: fuel role --create --file some Update role description :: fuel role --update --file some Delete role :: fuel role --delete --role 2 Performance Impact ------------------ No impact Plugin impact ------------- Maybe in future described schema will be reused for role entity in plugin. Other deployer impact --------------------- Dep Developer impact ---------------- Discuss things that will affect other developers working on Fuel, such as: * If the blueprint proposes a change to the driver API, discussion of how drivers would implement the feature is required. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: dshulyak Work Items ---------- 1. Implement REST Api for plugins 2. Implement CLI commands 3. Write documentation on added REST Api and CLI command Dependencies ============ No dependencies Testing ======= Unit tests coverage, and manual tests. Optionally system test can be implemented that will deploy ceph-mon, or neutron l3 agent as separate role, but it depends on library state of things Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation will be improved to contain References ========== No references ",,222,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Enable SSL for Fuel API endpoints ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/fuel-ssl-endpoints All traffic from/to Fuel is unsecured. Problem description =================== After introduction of access control to Fuel security has been improved but all credentials and data are transferred using HTTP protocol and are not protected. As solution to this problem is to secure all requests by using HTTPS connection and enable verification of certificate in all components of Fuel. Proposed change =============== Changes will be implemented in several stages. Stage I ------- Fuel use Nginx as a proxy for services that expose API endpoints. We will enable SSL connection in Nginx to secure traffic from/to Fuel. For the first phase of this feature we will use self-signed certificate that will be generated for the purpose of changes described in blueprint https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/ssl-endpoints. We will also try to reuse as much as possible from the feature created in that blueprint. We will need also to adjust fuelclient to work with secure API. The most important change is to validate certificate. On master node it will not be a problem since that certificate will be available in the system. If fuelclient will be used outside of the master node we need to add option to specify path to the certificate so user could download certificate from master node and use it to verify connection. It should be also possible to skip certificate check in fuelclient. In this stage also OSTF will be configured to check certificate. Stage II -------- Fuel agent should also verify that certificate is valid. This mean that the certificate must be delivered to nodes together with agent. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- All API requests will be encrypted using HTTPS. Upgrade impact -------------- Upgrade script will be responsible to generate new self-signed certificate that will be later used in Fuel. Security impact --------------- Using HTTPS for API requests will improve master node security. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- As we are using a self-signed certificate by default, if a user is using a web browser to query Fuel there will be a popup to warn than the certificate can not be trusted. Certificate that will be used will be expired after some time so user need to monitor expiration of the certificate. Performance Impact ------------------ Usage of HTTPS may add some latency to the APIs. Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- Every component of Fuel that is calling any of the APIs will need to be able to handle self-signed certificates. Using a self-signed certificate will affect Selenium tests for UI since browsers will display a warning about problems with certificate. API client in system test should skip certificate validation. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: <launchpad-id or None> Other contributors: <launchpad-id or None> Work Items ---------- Stage I ^^^^^^^ * Configure Nginx to handle SSL connection. * Add certificate validation in OSTF. * Add certificate validation in fuelclient with option to ignore it. Stage II ^^^^^^^^ * Distribute certificate together with the Fuel agent. * Enable certificate validation in Fuel agent. Dependencies ============ * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/ssl-endpoints * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/refactoring-for-fuelclient Testing ======= Since we are using self-signed certificate by default. Documentation Impact ==================== It should be described how to work with self-signed certificate. References ========== None ",,199,0

W/o this patch, haproxy daemon under load never can
be stopped gracefully and it also may exceed given stop/monitor
timeouts ending up being restarted by pacemaker.

The solution is:
* increase haproxy resource monitor/stop timeout and interval
* fix stop action for OCF to not rely on kill command exit codes
* wrap kill in retries and issue a SIGKILL only if there are no more
  retries left for gracefull termination

The blueprint for metadef tags shows:
Create / Replace all tags in a specific namespace
    POST /metadefs/namespaces/{namespace}/tags/
and
Add tag in a specific namespace:
    POST /metadefs/namespaces/{namespace}/tags/{tag}

Unfortunately, these were implemented as:
Create / Replace all tags in a specific namespace
    PUT /metadefs/namespaces/{namespace}/tags/
and
    POST /metadefs/namespaces/{namespace}/tags/

This bug seeks to rectify this situation and use the correct

the associated python-glanceclient check in has not been approved yet.
Additionally, the specs for the metadef tag changes have not been posted

Whitespace should be consistent inside of local_settings.py.example.

Currently, most comments in side our settings files follow the ""space
after # mark"" guideline. This is as it should be. However, commented out
code-lines are inconsistently including that space. Most of the time
they don't include it.

There's a case to be made for either approach:

Do include the space after the #:
    Keeps things consistent and it's how pyflakes likes things.

Do not include the space after the #:
    Identifies the commented out line as potential code, instead of a
    descriptive comment.

    Makes it easier to just remove the '#' character to activate the
    line of code. Specifically with python, leaving the white space is
    likely bad.

An informal survey of the lines in these files shows that most commented
out code lines do not have a space, and I agree with that policy. I'd
like to make this the policy and clean up the code.

Also added trailing ',' chars on the last element of many lists.

HyperVNeutronPlugin is hereby removed, as it is outdated
and it is no longer needed, thanks to Ml2Plugin. All of its
users should switch to Ml2Plugin.

The database tables 'hyperv_vlan_allocations' and

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Ironic Security Boot Mode ========================================== This spec proposes Ironic Security Boot mode to set next boot into secure boot for deployment of Bare Metal depends on node capability. With Intel TXT hardware support and enable, nodes go to trust boot.[1] With UEFI secure boot enable, nodes go to secure boot.[2] [1]https://review.openstack.org/#/c/133902 [2]https://review.openstack.org/#/c/135845 Problem description =================== There are two ways to securely deploy a node, Secure Boot and Trust Boot. Both of them can make sure the boot software: firmware drivers(Option ROM), boot loader and the Kernel/Ramdisk is trusted by Admin/End user. The big difference is secure boot will verify the signature before launch boot software. Trusted boot will launch boot software and then verify the hash value. There are two typical use cases for trust/secure boot: 1. Admin want to determine that an user released BM node is free of malware. Ironic run a CLEANING task, booting a customize image on the node with trust/secure boot and image will pass the result to Ironic to validate the integrity of firmware. 2. User want to be confident that the BM node obtained is free of malware. Ironic run a DEPLOYING task with trust/secure boot, that's all for Ironic. User can check the result by himself. Obviously, the workflow is similar: users pass a flavor with trust_boot flag. Ironic selects a node and boot it into trust/secure boot mode depends on the node's capability. Ironic should have a generic interface for this. Proposed change =============== Have a management interface to set secure boot mode. def set_secure_boot_mode(self, task, mode='NormalBoot'): """""" Set Secure Boot mode for the next boot :param task: a task from TaskManager. :param mode: String value to indicate the next boot mode: secure boot, trust boot, normal boot. """""" def get_secure_boot_mode(self, task): """""" Provides the current secure boot mode :param task: a task from TaskManager. :return: String value indicating current secure boot mode. """""" def get_supported_secure_boot_mode(self): """"""Get a list of the supported boot devices. :returns: A list with the supported secure boot modes defined """""" UEFI secure boot is not supported by all drivers. Trust boot works with pxe/ipxe boot but need Intel TXT Hardware support. Each secure boot mode has their own implementations, should be explained in their own BPs. ",,76,0

This patch adds more tests for ML2 extension driver.
It also fixes a minor bug which was revealed.

The data argument for process/update method of extension driver
was inconsist. some are given data like
{'resource': {'arg': 'value'...}}. But some are given one like
{'arg': 'value'}.
This inconsistency needs to be fixed so that argument is
{'arg': 'value'}. Given the argument is known to be network,
there is no point to carry outer dictionary.

In Juno, we used keepalived notifier scripts to report the local
state of an HA router's state. These have been found to be
unreliable. The proposed approach is to not use them altogether.
Instead, monitor the omnipresent VIP on the HA device - It is
only configured on the master instance. In order to do that,
we'll use the 'ip monitor address' wrapper introduced in this patch
to get address change events as they happen to avoid polling.

If we're doing a lot of build operations, we are using a large portion
of the limited rpc worker pool for long periods of time. Since we may wait
on external services (like neutron or glance) during those times, we could
fully deplete that pool.

This patch makes us spawn a new greenthread for that task and return the
rpc worker to the pool. Due to some funkiness with the stack of decorators,
this breaks the inner function out to an object method, which is probably
good anyway, given its size. This also moves the wrap_instance_event
decorator to the inner function so that the start and stop events properly
demarcate the actual task and not just the (now very quick) RPC call.

Icehouse changes:
- some patched unit tests were not present or had different names.
- minor change in unit tests to pass pep8 checks.

Cells prepend full cell path to the service ID before returning any
service related info. This means service ID is non numeric and can't
be cast into Service objects.  In cells, service_get_all method
in HostAPI (which is used to display list of services) strips out
the cell path from received IDs, creates Service objects using
remaining numerical ID and uses a ServiceProxy to associate cell paths
Service objects.
However, other service related methods do not do so. They include:
 - service_update (Used for enabling/disabling services)
 - service_get_all_by_host (Used for evacuation)
These functions try to cast received service info (with alphanumeric
service IDs) into Service objects and fail with a ValueError.
This leads to API cell throwing Error 500 for service-enable,
service-disable and evacuate.
This patch extends the ServiceProxy usage to both these methods. It
also changes the corresponding HostAPI tests.

Note: The required unit-tests are manually added to the below path,
as new path for unit-tests is not present in stable/icehouse release.

The construction of the combined svc-map-services file uses the host's
/tmp directory to store a work-in-progress file. That file's left behind
after it's done with.

There's a potential race here; together with problems that may arise
if two users attempt to run devtest on the same system.

This patch fixes this by creating the temporary file specifically under
$TMP_MOUNT_PATH.

The original code had a 'blockdev' which represented local disk types.
However, with volume support, the term 'block' became ambiguous.  This
change set modifies the blockdev to be named as a 'driver' under the

This provides consistency with the volume driver.

Also updated the generic 'StorageAdapter' within blockdev to be a

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Congress Workflow Description ========================================== Introduction ============= Congress targets to provide an extensible framework for governance and compliance across any cloud services existing today. The congress policy service will enable IT services in a human consumable and yet feasible to implementable abstraction. In the highlevel, Congress may not directly modify/update the state of any cloud services. Instead, it will leave the delegation of the underneath policy drivers and dedicated cloud service components (e.g. Nova in Openstack) to update the cloud services to the defined and compliant state. In the scope of the Openstack, Congress can enforce policy in the cloud services via the Heat, Nova, Swift, and Neutron. To better illustrate the potential scenario, this specification provides the workflow of using Congress, from the Congress policy definition to Neutron Group Based Policy (GBP) integration. The workflows of Congress to other cloud service components may follow the same principle in the , and will not be covered in this specification. Several different workflow models are discussed. Problem Description =================== We wanted to tackle a number of items: Specific for networking: where is the source of truth - describe what congress pulls up or pushes down 1.2) Congress as the single source of truth - publishing/pushing down partial/full information for other components to provision against 1.3) GBP as the single source of truth - congress pulling/receiving information from GBP to validate against policy 1.4) Cooperative sourcing of truth - congress requires GBP member information for validation; GBP requires congress policy to determine contracts (& derivatives of this scenario) 1.5) Both GBP and Congress are sources of truth - this is really the starting point imho; multiple sources are gathered in Congress to then perform policy validation or- troubleshooting tasks on. Contributors ============ Congress Interaction ===================== (Jim, Yapeng) Congress Workflow Models ======================== (All) Congress Workflow focuses on the congress integration with Neutron Policy functionality, a policy driver for neutron, specifically the Group Based Policy (GBP). In general there are three potential models for Congress to interact with GBP: Model A: Congress manages all policies, including network policies, and pushes the policy to the underneath network policy drivers. This model can also be called as Publish Model. Model B: where group membership comes from GBP and contract comes from Congress. Hybrid Model Model C: Congress validates/checks what GBP has. Pull Model Mode D: (? not being mentioned, or should we think it is combination of the above and not need a seperate topic) Publish Model Workflow ======================= (Jim, Yapeng) Hybrid Model Workflow ===================== (Nils) Pull Model Workflow =================== (Rukhsana) Proposed change =============== Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Work Items ---------- Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Unit tests will be added.

This kind of conditional execution right now is difficult currently in taskflow since we compile a workflow into a directed graph, verify inputs and outputs that each atom provides, create entries that track the atoms state and outputs (similar to a computers memory) and then execute. Conditional execution alters this since now we can not at compile time make a descision about whether a atom will or will not execute (since it is not known until runtime whether the atom actually will) so we need to address this to provide at least a *basic* level of support to accomplish a type of conditional execution. Proposed change =============== In order to support conditionals we first need to determine what a conditional means in a workflow, to make it simple (to start) let's limit the scope and suggest that a conditional is restricted to being a runtime scheduling choice that causes the path of execution to ``IGNORE`` X - 1 of X subgraphs and only ``ACTIVATE`` 1 of X subgraphs. This means that at compile time phase when a conditional is inserted into a flow that any attached outcomes of the conditional must satisfy all existing compilation validation strategies (requirements checking for example will enforce that any subgraph of the conditional must have inputs that are provided by some predecessor and that any outcome can provide inputs that satisify some other atom can depend on (just as they usually would). The next thing a conditional then needs a mechanism to influence the *outcome* which should be executed to one of the X subgraphs at runtime. To accomplish this the conditional needs the ability firstly to know what those potential outcomes are to decide what it can choose from. This is where the imperative paradigm would be a nice to *just* use as it can use local state, make a decision about that local state and keep on executing but since a flow is declarative we need another approach to solve this puzzle. A solution that comes to mind that work (but there could be other solutions that also work): * When a conditional is encountered while executing (assume there is some way to know that we have *hit* a conditional) we need to first freeze execution of any successors (nothing must execute in any outcomes subgraph ahead of time, this would violate the conditional constraint). Note that this does not mean that a subgraph executing that is not connected to this conditional will have to be stopped (its execution is not dependent on this outcome decision). So assuming we can freeze dependent execution (which we currently can do) we now need to provide the conditional a way to make a decision (usually the decision will be based on some prior execution or other external state). We have a mechanism for doing this already so we will continue using the existing requirements mechanism to communicate any state (local or otherwise). Now the conditional just needs to be able to pick which outcome should be executed so that the runtime can continue down that execution path. A potential options comes to mind here, one that can be flexible enough to allow for various further kind of conditionals to be implemented. The idea is that the conditional will be provided as input the successors subgraphs (in read-only mode) that *could* execute and each will have a unique name/identifier associated with it, the conditional will then use whatever internal logic to pick which one of those subgraphs should be executed and it will return this. This would complete a decision based on some provided inputs, and some potential set of outcomes, creating a simple but *hopefully* powerful mechanism for doing conditional like execution (without losing the benefits of the declarative paradigm). Conditionals have another an interesting interaction with retry logic, in that when a subgraph is retried, we must decide what to do about the X - 1 outcomes which were not traversed and decide if we should allow the prior outcome decision to be altered. This means that when a execution graph is retried it can be possible to enter a new subgraph (which may contain its own new set of retry strategies and so-on). To start we will *clear* the outcome of a conditional when a retry resets a conditional object (and causes it to be executed again), this will allow the most natural integration with the existing codebase (and is likely what users would expect to happen). Alternatives ------------ WIP Impact on Existing APIs ----------------------- This will require a new type that when encountered can be used to decide which outcome should taken. This new type will be a publicly useable type that can be dependened upon working as expected (observing and operating by the constraints described above). Security impact --------------- N/A Performance Impact ------------------ N/A Configuration Impact -------------------- N/A Developer Impact ---------------- A new way of using taskflow would be introduced that would hopefully recieve usage and mature as taskflow continues to progress.

However, a system that starts with a single disk and a partition power of 10 can have up to 1024 (2^10) disks.</para> <para>As back-end storage capacity is added to the system, the partition maps cause data to be redistributed amongst storage nodes.
