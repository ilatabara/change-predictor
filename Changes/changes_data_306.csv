LUKS password quality checking is not useful
since we only use long hex strings for passwords.

Not skipping this means that we have to install
cracklib-dicts for cryptsetup to work, which is
unnecessary weight.

This patch was adopted from Idd56c3f37d5786daae7181c36d38d267cbf1885c

Original description:
When reno 3.x runs under setuptools, it scans all of the branches it can
find, including any that look like they're closed and have an -eol tag.
The old kilo branch in this repository has a jumbled history that
somehow makes it look like it should include tags that it doesn't. We
know that there are no release notes in that branch, because reno wasn't
adopted while it was open. The releasenotes/source/index.rst links to
separate release notes in the wiki.

This patch tells reno to ignore that branch so that it doesn't throw an
exception when it gets confused about the old tag.

blockdiag has been used as an indirect dependcy via some sphinx
extensions such as sphinxcontrib-blockdiag and sphinxcontrib-actdiag
for several releases. For the past few releases nova has monkey
patched blockdiag to work around there global replacement
of codec.getreader under python 3.

The 2.0.0 release broke how that monkey patching worked and also
was the first release in several years. Now that the project is active
again we have reported the python 3 issue to the maintainer

has been adressed by https://github.com/blockdiag/blockdiag/pull/129
in 2.0.1 which has now been released.

This change blacklists 2.0.0. This change does not raise the minimum
requirement. Nova can selectively raise its minimum requirement in the
future in tree if it chooses to remove support for monkey patching
older releases.

Other project are recommended to use 2.0.1 or later as this is the first
release which is python3 only and is compatible with the sphinx
extentions we use without monkey patching.

Original description:
When reno 3.x runs under setuptools, it scans all of the branches it can
find, including any that look like they're closed and have an -eol tag.
The old kilo branch in this repository has a jumbled history that
somehow makes it look like it should include tags that it doesn't. We
know that there are no release notes in that branch, because reno wasn't
adopted while it was open. The releasenotes/source/index.rst links to
separate release notes in the wiki.

This patch tells reno to ignore that branch so that it doesn't throw an
exception when it gets confused about the old tag.

We'll keep separate lists of connectors for each of the supported
operating systems so that we don't end up trying to use unsupported
connectors.

Since Cinder is explicitly trying to use the iSCSI/FC connectors,
we'll have to include those as well, for now.

LUKS password quality checking is not useful
since we only use long hex strings for passwords.

Not skipping this means that we have to install
cracklib-dicts for cryptsetup to work, which is
unnecessary weight.

Currently we have a very wide /run mount for all Neutron/OVS services,
which allows sudo/rootwrap to contact with the hosts dbus - all symptoms
are documented in the related bug.

Since we use tcp connections to OVS from Neutron agents - removing
bind mounts.

Bugfix Icaf1bae8cb040b939f916a19ce026031ddb84af7 showed that restarting
a compute service in the functional env is unrealistic causing faults
to slip through. During that bug fix only the minimal change was done
in the functional env regarding compute service restart to reproduce
the reported fault. However the restart of the compute service could
be made even more realistic.

This patch simulates a compute service restart in the functional env
by stopping the original compute service and starting a totally new
compute service for the same host and node. This way we can make sure
that we get a brand new ComputeManager in the new service and no
state can leak between the old and the new service.

This change revealed another shortcoming of the functional env.
In the real world the nova-compute service could be restarted without
loosing any running servers on the compute host. But with the naive
implementation of this change the compute service is re-created. This
means that a new ComputeManager is instantiated that loads a new
FakeDriver instance as well. That new FakeDriver instance then reports
an empty hypervisor. This behavior is not totally unrealistic as it
simulates such a compute host restart that cleans the hypervisor state
as well (e.g. compute host redeployment). However this type of restart
shows another bug in the code path that destroys and deallocates
evacuated instance from the source host. Therefore this patch
implements the compute service restart in a way that simulates only a
service restart and not a full compute restart. A subsequent patch will
add a test that uses the clean hypervisor case to reproduces the
revealed bug.

This reverts commit 1c85fdc390e05eb578874e77fad9d4ec942da791.

Do not use randomly generated strings in configmaps as this leads to
whole helm release redeployment even no values are changed. The random
items have to be generated outside of helm chart and provided via
values.
Also previous behaviour didn't allow to use cache during rolling upgrade
as new pods were spawned with new key.

When Load Balancer and its member has FIP assigned
and environment is configured to use DVR the member
FIP needs to be centralized. It is current core OVN
limitation, that should be solved in [1].

This patch adds this mechanism to OVN Client.
It covers cases:

1) FIP association on port that is a member of
   some LB - make it centralized.
2) FIP association on LB VIP - find a members
   FIPs and centralized them.
3) The reverse of each of the above cases.

* Is the library actively maintained?

Yes, this module is actively maintained.

* Is the library good code? We would certainly like to think so.

This module is open-source and we would welcome reviews and comments.

* Is the library python 3 compatible?

Yes, the third-party CI at https://travis-ci.org/openuado/niet runs the
tests using Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial).

* Is the library license compatible?

Yes, this module is under a MIT license.

* Is the library already packaged in the distros we target (Ubuntu latest / Fedora latest)?

Not yet. We intend to add them to Debian and, hence, Ubuntu, and also for Fedora.

* Is the function of this library already covered by other libraries in
global-requirements.txt?

No; there is no other package that offers similar functionality.

* Is the library required for OpenStack project or related dev or
infrastructure setup?

Not yet; The goal of adding this to global-requirements is to subsequently add
niet usage to shell scripts to be able to use its powerful features.

* If the library release is managed by the Openstack release process does it
use the cycle-with-intermediary release type?

The `name` filter for volume transfer is not currently recognized by the
API. Instead, it allowed filtering on 'display_name', which is not the
actual name of any attribute of the resource.
This patch adds the support for it while secretly continuing to
support `display_name` as a valid filter so as not to break people who
have figured out the workaround.

This patchset introduces scenarios for the functional tests to unify the
setup and configuration of alternate messaging backends for RPC and
Notifications. The scenarios are defined to reduce redundancy in
the testing of backends and to demonstrate functional correctness
across driver combinations.

Current driver support:
rabbit - RPC, Notify
amqp   - RPC
kafka  - Notify

                  RPC       Notify
               ---------  ----------
scenario01       rabbit     rabbit
scenario02       rabbit     kafka
scenario03        amqp      rabbit
scenario04        amqp      kafka

It is anticipated that additional scenarios will be defined as new
drivers are introduced and/or new messaging intermediarites are supported.

Prior to this patch, the OVN metadata reused the NeutronWorkers
configuration to set the number workers it should spawn. This is not
ideal for OVN metadata because it works differently than the OVS
metadata agent, for example:

1) The OVN metadata workers are deployed onto the compute nodes and not
   on the controllers/gateways as the OVS ones are. This means it's
   better distributed.

2) Even tho we could have multiple workers, the OVN SB IDL in the OVN
   metadata agents acquires a lock while listening to OVSDB events.
   Therefore, even tho we could have dozens of agents only one of them
   is listening to the events.

3) Instantiating IDLs means maintaining in-memory replicas of the
   OVSDB (or, the tables of that DB that is being watched). This puts a
   burden on OVSDBs to maintain all these replicas updated, reducing
   this number workers also reduces the burden on the OVSDBs.

With this patch, we are adding a new configuration called
NeutronMetadataWorkers so that we can set different values for the API
workers and the metadata workers in a OVN deployment.

A pattern across our charms is to run
``charms_openstack.charm.use_defaults()`` at the global level
on top of the module encapsulating the reactive handlers
(i.e. ``src/reactive/charm_handlers.py``).

An example of an non-idempotent handler is the
``charm.default-select-release`` default handler, it keeps
global state and throws a RuntimeError on subsequent calls.

The way TestRegisteredHooks reloads the module makes it
impossible to mock this out, and I think the only solution
would be to mock this out in the test helper library itself.

Force systemd to reload its daemon units after a unit file is created,
so systemd knows about the new service and can start it.

Note: the reload should happen in the module but it seems that is not
enough so systemd knows about the freshly created unit file (race?).

It looks like we default to installing latest inside the virtualenv
all the time which can cause all sorts of issue, for example, upgrading
packages when it's not supposed to.

In addition, it also slows down tasks much more because it has to verify

This change introduces a fact check for neutron ports which will allow us
to pull a list of used IP addresses from our known port list which is
contains fixed_addresses. This port list will then be used to determine the
default ssh_user when first running a deployment. By pulling the neutron
facts and using the information to dictact the access user we'll be able

The cli-enable-ssh-admin.yaml makes several API intensive calls to heat

moves our api intensive calls to the top of the playbooks and blocks on

In certain scenarios the default poll interval of 5s used by
`openstack stack create --wait` command is too short.

Setting the poll interval was supported in heat CLI with
`heat stack-create --poll N` but is missing in OSC plugin.

This patch adds an optional argument `--poll N` (N defaults to 5) to the
`openstack stack create` command.

In some resource-constrained environments, particularly during service
bootstrap Galera cluster nodes can experience timeouts in inter-node
communication.

This change sets the gmcast.peer_timeout based on the galera cluster
documentation:

We are observing peer timeout issues on some CI runs - therefore raising
it to PT15S as in similar Ubuntu charms jobs.

The current initiator object for CADF notifications does not include
the username of the user who initiated the action, which leads to
issues when using an LDAP backend and not having a direct way to
map a username to a user id.

If an operator runs an update or upgrade of a cloud where containers

To prevent that, Paunch will fail to run if

The current initiator object for CADF notifications does not include
the username of the user who initiated the action, which leads to
issues when using an LDAP backend and not having a direct way to
map a username to a user id.

This change makes it so that the initiator object for CADF
notifications always contains the username for a user as well
as the user id. This follows along with the CADF standard
for OpenStack[0].

When upgrading from Rocky to Stein, an upgrade of the operating system is
performed. This upgrade from RHEL7 to RHEL8 implies the removal of the
default /usr/bin/python binary. As the facts cache is enabled, Ansible's
strategy does not consider to upgrade facts and therefore we try to run the
ansible playbook using the old python binary when running the upgrade.
This fails with the error: /usr/bin/python: No such file or directory.

This patch makes use of the setup task in combination with clear_facts
right after rebooting to upgrade the operating system, to ensure that
the facts are gathered and refreshed for the Overcloud node just upgraded.
This way, we make sure that we are using the right python binary.

This patch reverts [0].

The code wasn't accounting for VLAN provider networks, as stated in the
bug #1842988, DVR won't work if the provider network (where the FIP is
created) is VLAN.

There was also an incosistency in how the external_mac was set for the
VLAN networks. Upon creating the FIP the code was checking for the
network type and not setting the external_mac attribute in case the
network was VLAN type. But, if the port went down and up again (e.g if
you reboot the VM) the event handler that set/unset the external_mac [1]
wasn't check for the type. This is how people worked around the DVR
problem (as stated in bug #1842988).

For more information see bug #1842988.

Currently we have a very wide /run mount for all Neutron/OVS services,
which allows sudo/rootwrap to contact with the hosts dbus - all symptoms
are documented in the related bug.

Since we use tcp connections to OVS from Neutron agents - removing
bind mounts.

Paunch does docker/podman rm -f, when removes containers. It seems it
returns too early, having some leftovers (like docker service
endpoints) behind or pending for it to be removed later, in case of
big fat deamons.

Long story short, don't do rm -f and allow it to do its job gracefully

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================== Support volume local cache ========================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/support-volume-local-cache This blueprint proposes to add support of volume local cache in nova. Cache software such as dm-cache, bcache, open-cas can use fast NVME SSD to cache for the slow remote volume. Problem description =================== Currently there're different types of fast NVME SSDs, such as Intel Optane SSD, which r/w throughput can be 2.x~3.x GB/s, latency can be ~10 us. While typical remote volume for a VM can be hundreds of MB/s, latency can be millisecond level (iscsi / rbd). So these fast SSDs can be mounted on compute node locally and used as a cache for remote volumes. In order to do the cache, there're some cache softwares, such as dm-cache, bcache, Open CAS. This spec is trying to add volume local cache using such cache software. Use Cases --------- User wants to use fast NVME SSD to cache for remote slow volume. Proposed change =============== * Cache the volume during connecting volume In function _connect_volume(), there're two steps to do the cache: - Step1) Call os-brick to cache the volume. os-brick will call cache software to setup the cache and return an emulated volume. - Step2) Replace the path of original volume with the emulated volume * Release cache during disconnecting volume In function _disconnect_volume(), three steps will be included: - Step1) Retrieve the path of original volume from emulated volume - Step2) Call os-brick to release the cache for the volume - Step3) Replace the path in connection_info with the original volume path * Add switch in nova-cpu.conf to enable/disable local cache Suggested switch name: enable_local_cache POC code can be found in [1]_ Alternatives ------------ * Cache can be added in backend storage side, e.g. in ceph. Storage server normally has its own cache mechanism, e.g. using memory as cache, or using NVME SSD as cache. * Create a dedicated cache cluster. Mount all the cache (NVME SSD) in cache cluster as a big cache pool. Then allocate a certain ammount of cache to a specific volume. The allocated cache can be mounted on compute node through NVMEof protocol. Then still use cache software to do the same cache. But this would be the compete between local PCIe and remote network. The disadvantage if doing like these ways is: the network of the storage server would be bottleneck. - Throughput) Typical storage cluster, e.g. 50 servers with 10 PB capacity. Every server with 200 TB capacity and 2 x 40Gbps NICs. So the network bandwidth of every server would be 80Gbps, in other words, 10 GB/s. So total bandwidth of 50 servers would be 500 GB/s. Take 1000 compute nodes as a example, every compute node would only get 500 MB/s storage bandwidth in average. As a contrast, the bandwidth of typical NVME SSD would be around 3 GB/s. So it would be 6 times faster if NVME SSD are used as local cache. - Latency) Storage cluster typically provide volume through iscsi/fc protocol, or through librbd if ceph is used. The latency would be millisecond level. Even NVME over TCP, the latency would be hundreds of microsecond, typically larger than 500ms. As a contrast, the latency of NVME SSD would be around 10 ms, take Intel Optane SSD p4800x as example. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ * Throughput of VM volume will be increased * Latency of VM volume will be decreased Other deployer impact --------------------- * Option enable_local_cache should be set to True in nova-cpu.conf to enable this feature. Default value would be False which means local cache is disabled. enable_local_cache = True * Both nova and os-brick should be upgraded to contain local cache feature. Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- * Both nova and os-brick should be upgraded to contain local cache feature. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Liang Fang <liang.a.fang@intel.com> Work Items ---------- * Cache the volume during connecting volume * Release cache during disconnecting volume * Add switch to enable / disable this feature * Unit test to be added Dependencies ============ * os-brick: [2]_ Testing ======= * New unit test should be added * Function test with simulated cache should be added. This can use bcache, dm-cache or open-cas with a local file as NVME device. - Check if the emulated volume is created for VM or not. - Check if the emulated volume is released or not when deleting VM Documentation Impact ==================== * Document need to be changed to describe this feature and include the new switch - enable_local_cache References ========== ..

The vulnerability:managed tag's requirement #5 for a threat analysis
was untenable, and too significant a barrier for most teams to
overcome. Even most deliverables already covered by the tag never
had one performed in the ~4 years since it was added. The makeup of
our community was also somewhat different at the time it was
written: we no longer have a group of volunteers like the OSSG with
bandwidth to perform and review threat analyses (arguably we never
did), but also the VMT is well-staffed and the volume of
vulnerability reports it deals with has trailed off significantly.
In 2012 we published 20 advisories, and this climbed to 41 issued
within 2014. In contrast, we published 2 advisories in 2018, and 6
so far in 2019. The VMT has also regularly consulted with teams on
suspected vulnerabilities (on a best-effort basis) even on
deliverables lacking the vulnerability:managed tag. As a result,
while the softening of #5 from a hard requirement to a
recommendation could result in a significant increase in the number
of covered deliverables, the increase in caseload for the VMT
shouldn't be overwhelming.

Additionally, so as to offset some of the risk for increased work in
tracking too many embargoed reports for long periods of time,
institute a maximum embargo period of 3 months. Also clarify that
the VMT is not responsible for tracking reports of vulnerabilities
in any software maintained outside the OpenStack community, nor
appearing only in extended-maintenance branches, unreleased code in
master branches, pre-releases, release candidates, milestones, and
so on.

Projects are encouraged to undertake a review, audit, or threat implementation in the deliverable which could imply a large number of future vulnerability reports. In the event the project team peforms it, the results should ideally also be validated by a third party (could just be other members of the community not involved directly in that project). As much as anything this is a measure to keep the VMT's workload down, since it is by necessity a group of constrained size and some of its processes simply can't be scaled safely. If possible, the results should be proposed to the :repo:`openstack/security-analysis` repository in Gerrit and reviewed or refined there. This is only a recommendation, not a requirement for adding the tag.7. In the event that a team distributes additional software for which it is not an author (for example, base operating system components included in a server/container image or libraries vendored into compiled binary artifacts), the VMT will not track or issue advisories for these external software components. VMT coordination is limited in scope to only software whose source code is produced directly by official OpenStack project teams. 8. Deliverables must tag releases to qualify for VMT oversight. Vulnerabilities warrant advisories if they appear in official releases or on supported stable branches. Vulnerabilities only present in master since the last release, or only on branches under extended maintenance, will not have their disclosure coordinated by the VMT. Pre-releases, release candidates and milestones are not considered official releases for the purpose of this policy. 9. A maximum embargo period of 90 days must be respected for privately-reported vulnerabilities. Except under unusual circumstances the private report will be switched to public for continued work on solutions even if no advisory can yet be issued. until such time as they reach extended maintenance or end-of-life.","5. The deliverable's repos should undergo a review, audit, or threat implementation which could imply a large number of future vulnerability reports. The review, audit, or threat analysis may be done by the project team itself or an impartial third party. In the event the project team involved in the tagging peforms the review, audit, or threat analysis, the results must be validated by a third party. The VMT doesn't stipulate which third party would perform this review or validation; for example members of the OpenStack Security Group (OSSG) might volunteer to provide their expertise or some other third party including sponsoring companies of a project may offer assistance. As much as anything this is a measure to keep the VMT's workload down, since it is by necessity a group of constrained size and some of its processes simply can't be scaled safely. Finally, the results of the review, audit, or threat analysis must be proposed as a gerrit review in the :repo:`openstack/security-analysis` repository and accepted by the OpenStack Security Group (OSSG). Acceptance by the OpenStack Security Group (OSSG) of the documentation does not constitute a third party approval unless the OpenStack Security Group (OSSG) agrees in advance to acting as a third party approver.until such time as they reach end-of-life.",36,21

Create volume typesOnce the ``cinder.conf`` has been updated, :command:`openstack` commands need to be issued in order to create and associate OpenStack volume types with the declared ``volume_backend_names``. Additionally, each volume type will need an associated ``pool_name`` - an extra specification indicating the service level/ workload combination to be used for that volume type. There is also the option to assign a port group to a volume type by setting the ``storagetype:portgroupname`` extra specification. .. note:: It is possible to create as many volume types as the number of Service Level and Workload(available) combination for provisioning volumes. The pool_name is the additional property which has to be set and is of the format: ``<ServiceLevel>+<Workload>+<SRP>+<Array ID>``.

The type ``POWERMAX_FC_DIAMOND_DSS`` is associated with the ``FC_backend``, a Diamond Service Level, and a DSS workload. The ``ServiceLevel`` manages the underlying storage to provide expected performance. Setting the ``ServiceLevel`` to ``None`` means that non-FAST managed storage groups will be created instead (storage groups not associated with any service level). If ``ServiceLevel`` is ``None`` then ``Workload`` must be ``None``. .. code-block:: console openstack volume type set --property pool_name=None+None+SRP_1+000123456789 When a ``Workload`` is added, the latency range is reduced due to the added information.

Create volume types`_ for details... note:: Failover and Failback operations are not applicable in Metro configurations. After issuing Cinder failover-host command Cinder will set the R2 array as the target array for Cinder, however to get existing instances to use this new array and paths to volumes it is necessary to first shelve Nova instances and then unshelve them, this will effectively restart the Nova instance and re-establish data paths between Nova instances and the volumes on the R2 array. .. code-block:: console # nova shelve <server> # nova unshelve [--availability-zone <availability_zone>] <server> When a host is in failover mode performing normal volume or snapshot provisioning will not be possible, failover-host mode simply provides access to replicated volumes to minimise environment down-time. The primary objective whilst in failover mode should be to get the R1 array back online. When the primary array becomes available again, you can initiate a failback using the same failover command and specifying --backend_id default:After issuing the failover command to revert to the default backend host it is necessary to re-issue the Nova shelve and unshelve commands to restore the data paths between Nova instances and their corresponding back end volumes.

The type ``POWERMAX_FC_DIAMOND_DSS`` is associated with the ``FC_backend``, a Diamond Service Level, and a DSS workload. The ``ServiceLevel`` manages the underlying storage to provide expected performance. Setting the ``ServiceLevel`` to ``None`` means that non-FAST managed storage groups will be created instead (storage groups not associated with any service level). If ``ServiceLevel`` is ``None`` then ``Workload`` must be ``None``. .. code-block:: console openstack volume type set --property pool_name=None+None+SRP_1+000123456789 When a ``Workload`` is added, the latency range is reduced due to the added information. Setting the ``Workload`` to ``None`` means the latency range will be the widest for its Service Level type. Please note that you cannot set a Workload without a Service Level. .. code-block:: console openstack volume type set --property pool_name=Diamond+None+SRP_1+000123456789 .. note:: PowerMax and Hybrid support Optimized, Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, and NONE service levels.

Stable branches till stable/rocky is using python
version <py3.6. Tempest test those branch in venv
but Tempest tox use the master upper-constraint[1]
which block installation due to dependencies
require >=py3.6. For exmaple, oslo.concurrency 4.0.0
is not compatible for <py3.6.

As we pin Tempest for EM stable brach, we should be
able to use stable constraint for Tempest installation
as well as while running during run-tempest playbook.

tox.ini is hard coded to use master constraint[1] which force
run-tempest to recreate the tox env and use the master constraint.
Fix for that- https://review.opendev.org/#/c/705870/

nova-live-migration test hook run_test.sh needs to use the stable
u-c so that Tempest installation in venv will use stable
branch constraint.

Modify the irrelevant-files for nova-live-migration job to run
for run_test.sh script.

This patch beefs up the MetadataTest functional test cases to use a real
instance instead of a database shell. This way the tests see real data
in the metadata service like a real network_data.json.

This allows to assert that the nova generated network_data.json is
conforming to the jsonschema stored in the nova tree.

TODO:
* squash it to the schema patch
* figure out why jsonutils.load() fails while json.load() doesn't in
functional-py37.
* figure out a way to do the same with the config_drive.json

While trying to enable the redfish job in the CI we found:
`Duplicated timeseries in CollectorRegistry: {'baremetal_fan_status'}`,
this is due to the fact that  we were creating multiple `Gauge` for
the metric and Prometheus does not support this.

We should pre-create the Gauge and update with the different sets of
labels and values that were collected.

When upgrading from Rocky to Stein, an upgrade of the operating system is
performed. This upgrade from RHEL7 to RHEL8 implies the removal of the
default /usr/bin/python binary. As the facts cache is enabled, Ansible's
strategy does not consider to upgrade facts and therefore we try to run the
ansible playbook using the old python binary when running the upgrade.
This fails with the error: /usr/bin/python: No such file or directory.

This patch makes use of the setup task in combination with clear_facts
right after rebooting to upgrade the operating system, to ensure that
the facts are gathered and refreshed for the Overcloud node just upgraded.
This way, we make sure that we are using the right python binary.

In order to fix the referenced bug, we need to register cli args on
the global config object. Unfortunately, that causes issues because
our consumers are re-calling the conf object in their enforcers due
to the way we used to handle cli args. Specifically, the conf call
in the consumer fails because the namespace arg from oslo.policy is
registered as required, but they don't pass it to the conf call.

Long-term we want to stop having consumers call the conf object at
all, but in the meantime we need to provide a migration path that
doesn't break them. This change registers the namespace arg as
optional on the conf object and temporarily moves the required check
to oslo.policy. This will allow us to maintain the existing behavior
for our cli tools while not breaking consumers who haven't migrated
to the new cli arg behavior.

Note that we do have unit test coverage of this behavior[0], so we
can be reasonably confident the explicit check is maintaining
compatibility.

Previous to this patch, the 'unknown' address was added to the

version can also conflict with the version found in the git repo.
Programs using entrypoints such as python-openstackclient can then have

Add two sub-commands to pbr:

  rebuild - scans pkg_resources info and writes a json cache file
  install -  runs pip install then rebuilds the cache file

Then, add support to the version fetching code to read from the cache
file if it's present.

The cache file contains information both on packages and their versions
as well as all of the entrypoints registered on the system.

pbr.pkg_cache has a get_cache function that can be used by other
things, such as potentially stevedore, to try reading from the cache
before they try reading from pkg_resources.

Per http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/meetings/kolla/2020/kolla.2020-02-12-15.01.txt

Deprecates support for deploying MongoDB. In Victoria support for
deploying MongoDB will be removed from Kolla Ansible. Note CentOS 8
already lost support for MongoDB due to decisions made upstream.

This affects Panko as it will no longer be possible to get automatic
deployment of MongoDB database for it. However, the default, SQL,
backend is and will be supported via MariaDB.

MongoDB lost its position in OpenStack environment after
controversial relicensing under their custom SSPL (Server Side
Public License) which did not pass OSI (Open Source Initiative)
validation.

The aim of the test is to validate that in case master VM becomes not
available the traffic to the VIP is directed to the second VM.
Such setup is often used in setups with Octavia load balancers.

Scenario:
- Create a port for VRRP VIP and ports for VMs with
  allowed address pair configured to the VIP IP
- Create two VMs on different compute nodes
- Setup VRRP between the VMs
- Test traffic to virtual IP (login via ssh)
- Kill active VM

The `name` filter for volume transfer is not currently recognized by the
API. Instead, it allowed filtering on 'display_name', which is not the
actual name of any attribute of the resource.
This patch adds the support for it while secretly continuing to
support `display_name` as a valid filter so as not to break people who
have figured out the workaround.

driver that delegates load balancing to the network itself and does
not require VMs to handle the traffic.

Current gpu driver is out of data, it cannot generate attribute info
(""resource_class""/""rc"" and ""traits"") of the gpu device, as a result
cyborg-conductor cannot report the device to placement and nova cannot
schedule this device during the process of nova boot.
This patch added the attribute_list generation in gpu driver so that
the device info can be reported to placement and user can boot an instance
with gpu device.

When reno 3.x runs under setuptools, it scans all of the branches it can
find, including any that look like they're closed and have an -eol tag.
The old kilo branch in this repository has a jumbled history that
somehow makes it look like it should include tags that it doesn't. We
know that there are no release notes in that branch, because reno wasn't
adopted while it was open. The releasenotes/source/index.rst links to
separate release notes in the wiki.

This patch tells reno to ignore that branch so that it doesn't throw an
exception when it gets confused about the old tag.

The upgrade workflow to Stein has a guard task that
checks that the --limit option is being used when
running the overcloud upgrade run command, as the
upgrade needs to be performed node by node due to
the operating system upgrade. However, if the --limit
option is not passed, the upgrade tasks fails in the
task right before the guard, as that task already
references the undefined variable. So, it is needed
to invert the order so we fail at will in the guard
task.

Setting tripleo_container_manage_check_puppet_config to true will allow
us to get up-to-date config hashes in the container startup config right

It helps to have idempotent ansible runs and we avoid the restart of
containers when not needed.

pywinrm allows sending commands to remote Windows hosts via WinRM,
pretty much resembling SSH.

- Is the library actively maintained?

Yes, there are a few quite recent releases:
https://github.com/diyan/pywinrm/releases

Yes. Despite being pre-1.0, it provides a stable and well documented API. The
code is easy to understand and well tested. It's a simple library that
implements the WinRM SOAP protocol.

- Is the library python 3 compatible?

Yes.

- Is the library license compatible?

Yes, it's MIT licensed.

- Is the library already packaged in the distros we target (Ubuntu latest /
Fedora latest)?

Yes, it's available on PyPI as well as Ubuntu upstream repositories.

- Is the function of this library already covered by other libraries in
global-requirements.txt?

No.

- Is the library required for OpenStack project or related dev or
infrastructure setup? (Answer to this should be Yes, of course) Which?

Yes, it's already used by the Manila Windows driver (similar to the Linux
generic one but using Windows instances) as well as the oswin-tempest-plugin
project.

- If the library release is managed by the Openstack release process does
it use the cycle-with-intermediary release type?

No, it's not an openstack project.

- Do I need to update anything else?

No.

Support the new option in Paunch which allows to not cleaning containers
not part of a config.

Also by security, if only one .json file is given in ""config"" parameter,
we will force cleanup to false, to avoid the deletion of the other
containers in the same config id.

If there is no entry (this node's IP and port) in object ring,
object-server gets empty list of ports, and it causes
object-server doesn't bind any port but it's running without any
warning message in swift logs.

This patch is to prevent object-server from start if no devices
on this node.

Patch https://review.opendev.org/#/c/697655/ cannot be backported
because it includes an RPC version change. This patch is for the
stable branches.

Currently the ovs agent calls update_device_list with the
agent_restarted flag set only on the first loop iteration. Then the
server knows to send the l2pop flooding entries for the network to
the agent. But when a compute node with many instances on many
networks reboots, it takes time to readd all the active devices and
some may be readded after the first loop iteration. Then the server
can fail to send the flooding entries which means there will be no
flood_to_tuns flow and broadcasts like dhcp will fail.

This patch fixes that by also setting the agent_restarted flag if
the agent has not received the flooding entries for a network.

The ""network_segment_range"" service plugin API does not have
""tenant_id"" as parameter. However, because the migration from
""tenant_id"" to ""project_id"" did not finish, every OVO with
""project_id"" will also have ""tenant_id"" as an extra field. This
extra field will be populated with the same value as the
""project_id"" field.

If the Neutron API WSGI is used and ""tenant_id"" is not present in
the API (defined in neutron-lib), both ""tenant_id"" and ""project_id""
parameters will be removed from the response.

This patch introduces a workaround for this OVO until the migration
is over.

When reno 3.x runs under setuptools, it scans all of the branches it can
find, including any that look like they're closed and have an -eol tag.
The old kilo branch in this repository has a jumbled history that
somehow makes it look like it should include tags that it doesn't. We
know that there are no release notes in that branch, because reno wasn't
adopted while it was open. The releasenotes/source/index.rst links to
separate release notes in the wiki.

This patch tells reno to ignore that branch so that it doesn't throw an
exception when it gets confused about the old tag.

This bumps the version of flake8 and pycodestyle to something much
newer, which resolves a long-standing warning about nested sets and
allows us to use new fangled features like f-strings if we so choose.

The puppet-keystone project consolidated keystone applications:

  https://github.com/openstack/puppet-keystone/commit/ace7aeb3b71b39a59f92fbc9e7f676a70c9a797a#diff-e5968f40345cf5d3be0539fbba87f787

This effectively reduces the number of available workers to process
keystone requests since only half the processes are deployed now that
the applications are consolidated [0]. As a result, we see a performance
regression [1] when interacting with keystone.

For example, in earlier versions, an 8 core machine would spawn four
processes to serve the keystone-main application. Another four processes
would be spawned to serve the keystone-admin application. Now, we only
have 4 processes total to serve the entire keystone application. Due to
the difference in the number of workers deployed by default, users will
experience reduced performance out-of-the-box.

This patch not only brings performance back to the previous levels, it
is also safe to implement as we are not changing the number of workers
when compared to previous releases and only bringing parity.

Manila tempest plugin class structure should be compatible
with tempest project as manila tempest plugin is a plugin
of tempest.
In some cases incompatibility can cause problems.
For example: using ""check_uuid"" tool for generating UUIDs
for tests does not work properly in manila, Because some
classes are wrapped with conditions skipped.
I suggest to use ""skip_checks"" method that been used to
evaluate config before tests methods and skip them based
on these checks.

This patch moves all conditions under this method.

Two new functions been added to ""skip_checks"" method
in order to skip by microversions and reduce a duplicated
code:
  - ""check_skip_with_microversion""
  - ""check_skip_with_microversion_not_supported""

This patch delegates tasks setting up a keystone identity provider to the
keystone_service_setup_host becasue the ansible modules used require the
python-keystoneclient module. These tasks will fail when the keystone
(container) host is not the deploy host as python-keystoneclient will
be missing.

These tasks have recently been refactored in a previous patch [1] to use
the os_* ansible modules instead of the OSA specific keystone module.
This patch fixes a reported bug with the old code which is also present
after that refactoring.

Next week, the release team will propose releases for any library that has not been otherwise released since milestone 1. PTL's and release liaisons, please watch for these and give a +1 to acknowledge them. If there is some reason to hold off on a release, let us know that as well. A +1 would be appreciated, but if we do not hear anything at all by the end of the week, we will assume things are OK to proceed. Remember that non-library deliverables that follow the cycle-with-intermediary release model should have an intermediary release before milestone-2. Those who haven't will be proposed to switch to the cycle-with-rc model, which is more suited to deliverables that are released only once per cycle. Next week is also the deadline to freeze the contents of the final release. All new '$SERIES' deliverables need to have a deliverable file in https://opendev.org/openstack/releases/src/branch/master/deliverables and need to have done a release by milestone-2. The following new deliverables have not had a release yet, and will not be included in $SERIES unless a release is requested for them in the coming week: [ list of deliverables ] Changes proposing those deliverables for inclusion in $SERIES have been posted, please update them with an actual release request before the milestone-2 deadline if you plan on including that deliverable in $SERIES, or -1 if you need one more cycle to be ready. Upcoming Deadlines & Dates -------------------------- $SERIES-2 Milestone: $milestone2 #. Send the following weekly email content:: Development Focus ----------------- We are now past the $SERIES-2 milestone, and entering the last development phase of the cycle. Teams should be focused on implementing planned work for the cycle. Now is a good time to review those plans and reprioritize anything if needed based on the what progress has been made and what looks realistic to complete in the next few weeks. General Information ------------------- Looking ahead to the end of the release cycle, please be aware of the feature freeze dates. Those vary depending on deliverable type: * General libraries (except client libraries) need to have their last feature release before Non-client library freeze ($nclfreeze). Their stable branches are cut early. * Client libraries (think python-*client libraries) need to have their last feature release before Client library freeze ($milestone3) * Deliverables following a cycle-with-rc model (that would be most services) observe a Feature freeze on that same date, $milestone3. Any feature addition beyond that date should be discussed on the mailing-list and get PTL approval. After feature freeze, cycle-with-rc deliverables need to produce a first release candidate (and a stable branch) before RC1 deadline ($rc1-deadline) * Deliverables following cycle-with-intermediary model can release as necessary, but in all cases before Final RC deadline ($final-rc-deadline) Upcoming Deadlines & Dates -------------------------- Non-client library freeze: $nclfreeze (R-6 week) Client library freeze: $milestone3 (R-5 week) Ussuri-3 milestone: $milestone3 (R-5 week) $other-upcoming-event ",,93,0

It covers all the basics that are common to all OpenStack projects: the accounts you need, the basics of interacting with our Gerrit review system, how we communicate as a community, etc. Below will cover the more project specific information you need to get started with {{cookiecutter.service}}. Communication ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .. This would be a good place to put the channel you chat in as a project; when/ where your meeting is, the tags you prepend to your ML threads, etc. Contacting the Core Team ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .. This section should list the core team, their irc nicks, emails, timezones etc. If all this info is maintained elsewhere (i.e. a wiki), you can link to that instead of enumerating everyone here. New Feature Planning ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .. This section is for talking about the process to get a new feature in. Some projects use blueprints, some want specs, some want both! Some projects stick to a strict schedule when selecting what new features will be reviewed for a release. Task Tracking ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .. This section is about where you track tasks- launchpad? storyboard? is there more than one launchpad project? what's the name of the project group in storyboard? We track our tasks in {{ cookiecutter.bug_tracker }} {%- if cookiecutter.bug_tracker == 'Launchpad' -%} https://bugs.launchpad.net/{{ cookiecutter.bug_project }} {%- elif cookiecutter.bug_tracker == 'Storyboard' -%} https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/{{ cookiecutter.bug_project }} {%- endif -%} If you're looking for some smaller, easier work item to pick up and get started on, search for the 'low-hanging-fruit' tag. .. NOTE: If your tag is not 'low-hanging-fruit' please change the text above. Reporting a Bug ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .. Pretty self explanatory section, link directly to where people should report bugs for your project. You found an issue and want to make sure we are aware of it? You can do so $HERE. Getting Your Patch Merged ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .. This section should have info about what it takes to get something merged. Do you require one or two +2's before +W? Do some of your repos require unit test changes with all patches? etc. Project Team Lead Duties ------------------------ .. this section is where you can put PTL specific duties not already listed in the common PTL guide (linked below) or if you already have them written up elsewhere, you can link to that doc here. All common PTL duties are enumerated here in the `PTL guide <https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/ptl.html>`_.",70,82

After issuing Cinder failover-host command Cinder will set the R2 array as the target array for Cinder, however to get existing instances to use this new array and paths to volumes it is necessary to first shelve Nova instances and then unshelve them, this will effectively restart the Nova instance and re-establish data paths between Nova instances and the volumes on the R2 array. .. code-block:: console # nova shelve <server> # nova unshelve [--availability-zone <availability_zone>] <server> When a host is in failover mode performing normal volume or snapshot provisioning will not be possible, failover-host mode simply provides access to replicated volumes to minimise environment down-time. The primary objective whilst in failover mode should be to get the R1 array back online. When the primary array becomes available again, you can initiate a failback using the same failover command and specifying --backend_id default:After issuing the failover command to revert to the default backend host it is necessary to re-issue the Nova shelve and unshelve commands to restore the data paths between Nova instances and their corresponding back end volumes.

When reno 3.x runs under setuptools, it scans all of the branches it can
find, including any that look like they're closed and have an -eol tag.
The old kilo branch in this repository has a jumbled history that
somehow makes it look like it should include tags that it doesn't. We
know that there are no release notes in that branch, because reno wasn't
adopted while it was open. The releasenotes/source/index.rst links to
separate release notes in the wiki.

This patch tells reno to ignore that branch so that it doesn't throw an
exception when it gets confused about the old tag.

LUKS password quality checking is not useful
since we only use long hex strings for passwords.

Not skipping this means that we have to install
cracklib-dicts for cryptsetup to work, which is
unnecessary weight.

When we reach xtremio_volumes_per_glance_cache, it is not able
to create more clones for the image-volume therefore requires to
create a new cache entry.
Keeping in mind the case in [1], we can get CinderException for
various reasons from different drivers during the clone operation.
So we define a new exception for the xtremio driver to force create
a new cache entry when the limit reaches and not enforce the same

In FIPS 140-2 mode, the underlying operating system will
prevent the loading of certian algorithms for hasing and
encryption. Python hashlib returns a ValueError exception
when the type cannot be instantiated.

This change catches the error and returns a relatively

In order to reduce the number of elements retrieved from the DB, this
patch, before processing the VLAN allocations per physical network,
deleted those registers belonging to any unconfigured physical network.

The VLAN registers per physical network are deleted using a bulk delete
operation, to speed up the process.

Those missing VLAN registers per network are now created using a bulk
insert operation, available in the ORM. This bulk operation speeds up
the sync process.

A charm class can provide a dictionary that maps package
versions to OpenStack releases.  This dictionary is
consulted when determining if a OpenStack upgrade is available.

However, when determining release for selection of charm class
the map is not consulted.  This patch teaches the default select
release handler how to do so.

Pass on source configuration key as specified by charm class
to charm-helpers where appropriate.

This solution adds the pagination and makes the code more readable.

Validate basic huge page assignment to an instance. When assigning huge
pages to an instance, a NUMA topology will automatically be added, thus
this is a subclass of the NUMA tests.

This will prove useful as a starting base for functional tests if we
ever do manage to get memory pages modelled in placement.

Presently, vnf package can be deleted when it's operationalState is
'ENABLED'.

As per pre-condition rule, vnf package can be deleted only when
it's operationalState is 'DISABLED' and it's usageState is 'NOT_IN_USE.

This patch fixes this issue and now vnf package will be deleted only
when it's operationalState is 'DISABLED' and it's usageState is 'NOT_IN_USE.

Note: I have fixed windows style line ending issue in vnf_packages.inc.
Also, updated 'Delete VNF Package' API doc to include 409 error.

Currently, QoS is implemented by TC command of HV OS.
This solution has many drawbacks, such as not supported

Meter is a comfortable solution, because it is implemented

This commit adds experimental jobs to run horizon with the master branches
of xstatic repositories. It allows us to test xstatic packages before
merging/releasing them.

The existing npm jobs do not support sibling installation into the tox
env ""npm"" which is used by the npm jobs. In a new experimental npm job
with xstatic master repos, sibling installation is now supported.

Note that this change is proposed only to the horizon repo
to avoid sending the similar change to many xstatic repos.

When a volume record is soft-deleted in the database,
dependent records in other tables (for example,
Transfers, VolumeGlanceMetadata, etc.) must be soft
deleted as well.  Otherwise, we will get FK dependency
errors when the database is purged.

This patch adds that support for VolumeAttachment table.
(other tables were already covered, just refactored)

Also adds tests.
