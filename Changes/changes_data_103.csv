When a patch is submitted against a branch, Zuul CI will collect job
variants for each ci job and all its parent jobs. If both job.\
override-checkout and job.required-projects.override-checkout
attributes are not defined, then Zuul will for each (parent) job match
the current branch of the patch against all branches of the project in
which the job is defined. If no such branch exist in a project, then no
job variant matches and this job will be ignored [1].
For example, if a patch is submitted for our stable/1.0.0 branch, then
Zuul CI will try to match 'stable/1.0.0' against all branches in the
projects where job ansible-collections-openstack-functional-devstack
and its parent job openstacksdk-functional-devstack are defined. The
first is defined in openstack/ansible-collections-openstack/.zuul.yaml,
so a match for stable/1.0.0 will be found. But openstacksdk-functional-\
devstack is defined in openstack/openstacksdk/.zuul.yaml which has no
branch stable/1.0.0 defined. So Zuul will not schedule job ansible-\
collections-openstack-functional-devstack at all.

The solution is twofold. First, the base jobs such as ansible-\
collections-openstack-functional-devstack have to be changed to always
checkout existing branches in projects which define (parent) jobs.
Using job.override-checkout might have unintended sideeffects because
it will checkout the specified branch for all required projects which
also includes the project which the patch was submitted for. Instead
we set job.required-projects.override-checkout for all projects which
define parent jobs. For example, in ansible-collections-openstack-\
functional-devstack we set job.required-projects.override-checkout to
master for opendev.org/openstack/devstack which defines parent job
openstack-functional-devstack.

In child jobs which (re)define job.override-checkout, we have to change
job.required-projects.override-checkout for all projects which define
parent jobs to the value of job.override-checkout. If we fail to update
job.required-projects.override-checkout then Zuul will checkout the
branch which was defined in the base jobs because job.\
required-projects.override-checkout has higher precedence than job.\
override-checkout.

Setting attribute project.<pipeline>.debug to true helps with debugging
these job scheduling issues. ""If this is set to true, Zuul will include
debugging information in reports it makes about items in the pipeline.
This should not normally be set, but in situations were it is difficult
to determine why Zuul did or did not run a certain job, the additional
information this provides may help"" [2].

Note, once job scheduling has been completed, Zuul will use a different
algorithm to checkout projects which are listed in job.\
required-projects [3][4]. It will fallback to a default branch if no
matching branch can be found in projects [5].

In order for tripleoclient to properly display a confirmation about
unprovisioning network ports for pre-provisioned nodes, the
pre-provisioned node data must be added to the unprovision confirmation.

The output structure written to the unprovision confirmation file is
changed from a list to a dict so that the provisioned vs pre-provisioned
nodes can be distinguished. This change would break tripleoclient,
however the associated tripeloclient depends-on patch adds backwards
compatibility to check for a list or dict.

A single paragraph of prose that operators can understand. The title and this first paragraph should be used as the subject line and body of the commit message respectively. Some notes about the spec process: * Not all blueprints need a spec, start with a story. * The aim of this document is first to define the problem we need to solve, and second agree the overall approach to solve that problem. * This is not intended to be extensive documentation for a new feature. For example, there is no need to specify the exact configuration changes, nor the exact details of any DB model changes. But you should still define that such changes are required, and be clear on how that will affect upgrades. * You should aim to get your spec approved before writing your code. While you are free to write prototypes and code before getting your spec approved, its possible that the outcome of the spec review process leads you towards a fundamentally different solution than you first envisaged. * But API changes are held to a much higher level of scrutiny. As soon as an API change merges, we must assume it could be in production somewhere, and as such, we then need to support that API change forever. To avoid getting that wrong, we do want lots of details about API changes up front. Some notes about using this template: * Your spec should be in ReSTructured text, like this template. * Please wrap text at 79 columns. * The filename in the git repository should start with the StoryBoard story number. For example: ``2005171-allocation-partitioning.rst``. * Please do not delete any of the sections in this template. If you have nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None * For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html * To test out your formatting, build the docs using ``tox -e docs`` and see the generated HTML file in doc/build/html/specs/<path_of_your_file>. The generated file will have an ``.html`` extension where the original has ``.rst``. * If you would like to provide a diagram with your spec, ascii diagrams are often the best choice. http://asciiflow.com/ is a useful tool. If ascii is insufficient, you have the option to use seqdiag_ or actdiag_. .. _seqdiag: http://blockdiag.com/en/seqdiag/index.html .. _actdiag: http://blockdiag.com/en/actdiag/index.html Problem description =================== A detailed description of the problem. What problem is this feature addressing? Use Cases --------- What use cases does this address? What impact on actors does this change have? Ensure you are clear about the actors in each use case: Developer, End User, Deployer etc. Proposed change =============== Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How do you propose to solve this problem? If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In other words, what's the scope of this effort? At this point, if you would like to get feedback on if the problem and proposed change fit in placement, you can stop here and post this for review saying: Posting to get preliminary feedback on the scope of this spec. Alternatives ------------ What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one. Data model impact ----------------- Changes which require modifications to the data model often have a wider impact on the system. The community often has strong opinions on how the data model should be evolved, from both a functional and performance perspective. It is therefore important to capture and gain agreement as early as possible on any proposed changes to the data model. Questions which need to be addressed by this section include: * What new data objects and/or database schema changes is this going to require? * What database migrations will accompany this change? * How will the initial set of new data objects be generated? For example if you need to take into account existing instances, or modify other existing data, describe how that will work. API impact ---------- Each API method which is either added or changed should have the following * Specification for the method * A description of what the method does suitable for use in user documentation * Method type (POST/PUT/GET/DELETE) * Normal http response code(s) * Expected error http response code(s) * A description for each possible error code should be included describing semantic errors which can cause it such as inconsistent parameters supplied to the method, or when a resource is not in an appropriate state for the request to succeed. Errors caused by syntactic problems covered by the JSON schema definition do not need to be included. * URL for the resource * URL should not include underscores; use hyphens instead. * Parameters which can be passed via the url * JSON schema definition for the request body data if allowed * Field names should use snake_case style, not camelCase or MixedCase style. * JSON schema definition for the response body data if any * Field names should use snake_case style, not camelCase or MixedCase style. * Example use case including typical API samples for both data supplied by the caller and the response * Discuss any policy changes, and discuss what things a deployer needs to think about when defining their policy. Note that the schema should be defined as restrictively as possible. Parameters which are required should be marked as such and only under exceptional circumstances should additional parameters which are not defined in the schema be permitted (eg additionaProperties should be False). Reuse of existing predefined parameter types such as regexps for passwords and user defined names is highly encouraged. Security impact --------------- Describe any potential security impact on the system. Some of the items to consider include: * Does this change touch sensitive data such as tokens, keys, or user data? * Does this change alter the API in a way that may impact security, such as a new way to access sensitive information or a new way to log in? * Does this change involve cryptography or hashing? * Does this change require the use of sudo or any elevated privileges? * Does this change involve using or parsing user-provided data? This could be directly at the API level or indirectly such as changes to a cache layer. * Can this change enable a resource exhaustion attack, such as allowing a single API interaction to consume significant server resources? Some examples of this include launching subprocesses for each connection, or entity expansion attacks in XML. For more detailed guidance, please see the OpenStack Security Guidelines as a reference (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/Guidelines). These guidelines are a work in progress and are designed to help you identify security best practices. For further information, feel free to reach out to the OpenStack Security Group at openstack-security@lists.openstack.org. Other end user impact --------------------- Aside from the API, are there other ways a user will interact with this feature? * Does this change have an impact on osc-placement? What does the user interface there look like? Performance Impact ------------------ Describe any potential performance impact on the system, for example how often will new code be called, and is there a major change to the calling pattern of existing code. Examples of things to consider here include: * A small change in a utility function or a commonly used decorator can have a large impacts on performance. * Calls which result in a database queries can have a profound impact on performance when called in critical sections of the code. * Will the change include any locking, and if so what considerations are there on holding the lock? Other deployer impact --------------------- Discuss things that will affect how you deploy and configure OpenStack that have not already been mentioned, such as: * What config options are being added? Should they be more generic than proposed? Are the default values ones which will work well in real deployments? * Is this a change that takes immediate effect after its merged, or is it something that has to be explicitly enabled? * If this change is a new binary, how would it be deployed? * Please state anything that those doing continuous deployment, or those upgrading from the previous release, need to be aware of. Also describe any plans to deprecate configuration values or features. Developer impact ---------------- Discuss things that will affect other developers working on OpenStack. Upgrade impact -------------- Describe any potential upgrade impact on the system. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: <IRC nick or None> Other contributors: <IRC nick or None> Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Dependencies ============ * Include specific references to other specs or stories that this one either depends on or is related to. * If this requires new functionality in another project that is not yet used document that fact. * Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not included in OpenStack? Or does it depend on a specific version of a library? Testing ======= Please discuss the important scenarios that need to be tested, as well as specific edge cases we should be ensuring work correctly. Documentation Impact ==================== Which audiences are affected most by this change, and which documentation titles on docs.openstack.org should be updated because of this change? Don't repeat details discussed above, but reference them here in the context of documentation for multiple audiences. References ========== Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any references. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are: * Links to mailing list or IRC discussions * Links to notes from a summit session * Links to relevant research, if appropriate * Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to History ======= Optional section intended to be used each time the spec is updated to describe new design, API or any database schema updated. Useful to let the reader understand how the spec has changed over time. .. list-table:: Revisions :header-rows: 1 * - Release Name - Description * - <Replace With Current Release> - Introduced ",18,346

Doing them all at once doesn't speed anything up, because the cinder-stable-maint team will **not** approve a backport to branch *n*-1 until the patch has been merged into branch *n*. From time to time, you may find a bug that's been fixed in master, and you'd like to have that fix in the release you're currently using (for example, Wallaby). What you want to do is propose a **backport** of the fix. .. note:: The Cinder project observes the OpenStack `Stable Branch Policy <https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/stable-branches.html>`_. Thus, not every change in master is backportable to the stable branches. In particular, features are *never* backportable. A really complicated bugfix may not be backportable if what it fixes is low-occurrence and there's a high risk that it may cause a regression elsewhere in the software. How can you tell? Ask in the ``#openstack-cinder`` channel on IRC or during the open discussion part of the weekly Cinder team meeting. Since we use git for source code version control, backporting is done by *cherry-picking* a change that has already been merged into one branch into another branch. The gerrit web interface makes it really easy to do this. In fact, maybe *too* easy. Here are some guidelines: * Before you cherry-pick a change, make sure it has already **merged** to master. If the change hasn't merged yet, it may require further revision, and the commit you've cherry-picked won't be the correct commit to backport. * Backports must be done in *reverse chronological order*. Since OpenStack releases are named alphabetically, this means reverse alphabetical order: ``stable/yoga``, ``stable/xena``, ``stable/wallaby``, etc. * The cherry-pick must have **merged** into the closest most recent branch before it will be considered for a branch, that is, a cherry-pick to ``stable/xena`` will **not** be considered until it has merged into ``stable/yoga`` first. * This is because sometimes a backport requires revision along the way. For example, different OpenStack releases support different versions of Python. So if a fix uses a language feature introduced in Python 3.8, it will merge just fine into current master (during zed development), but it will not pass unit tests in ``stable/yoga`` (which supports Python 3.6). Likewise, if you already cherry-picked the patch from master directly to ``stable/xena``, it won't pass tests there either (because xena also supports Python 3.6). So it's better to follow the policy and wait until the patch is merged into ``stable/yoga`` *before* you propose a backport to ``stable/xena``. * You can propose backports directly from git instead of using the gerrit web interface, but if you do, you must include the fact that it's a cherry-pick in the commit message. Gerrit does this automatically for you *if you cherry-pick from a merged commit* (which is the only kind of commit you should cherry-pick from in Gerrit); git will do it for you if you use the ``-x`` flag when you do a manual cherry-pick. This will keep the history of this backport intact as it goes from branch to branch. We want this information to be in the commit message and to be accurate, because if the fix causes a regression (which is always possible), it will be helpful to the poor sucker who has to fix it to know where this code came from without digging through a bunch of git history. If you have questions about any of this, or if you have a bug to fix that is only present in one of the stable branches, ask for advice in ``#openstack-cinder`` on IRC. ",,77,0

This patch removes the ``IpAddressAllocationNotFound`` exception. This
exception was raised when a IPAM register was called to be deleted
but not found.

As reported in the LP bug, this IPAM register deletion can be called
several times if a port fails during the creation. The IPAM register
deletion calls the DB deletion but doesn't raise any exception if the
register does not exist. The code ensures the IPAM register is
deleted and there is no need to fail if it is not present anymore.

This patch also removes the exception catch and try in ""update_port"",
that was added in [0] as a fix for [1]. That was added because the
subnet deletion code involved a port update call [2] during the
IP allocation deletion, if any port was still present in the subnet.
Since [3], this code is not needed because the subnet deletion does
not call a port update anymore.

Thus it's important to make sure that you are looking at the version of this document that is applicable to the OpenStack release you have deployed. This document applies to the **Yoga** release. Additionally, keep in mind that different projects are implementing secure RBAC on different schedules. This document applies *only* to Cinder. To get an idea of the full scope of this effort, consult the `Consistent and Secure Default RBAC <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/goals/selected/consistent-and-secure-rbac.html>`_ community goal document. This is easiest to explain if we introduce the three ""personas"" Cinder recognizes in the Xena and Yoga releases.

In particular: a user with the ``member`` role on a ``system``. Likewise, cinder does not recognize a ""system-reader"" persona, that is, a user with the ``reader`` role on a ``system``.

In Xena and Yoga, there are three personas. .. list-table:: The 3 Xena/Yoga PersonasIn the Zed release, we plan to implement more Cinder personas that the default policy configuration will recognize. During the development of this OpenStack wide effort, however, some complexities were discovered that have affected exactly what this set of personas and their capabilities will be.

(The administrative abilities are ""minor"" in the sense that they have no impact on the Cinder system, they only allow the project-admin to make system-safe changes isolated to that project.) * - system-reader - Has read only access to the API; like the project-reader, but can read any project recognized by cinder. but Cinder does not currently recognize them. In particular: a user with the ``member`` role on a ``system``.

In fullstack tests like test_connectivity or test_securitygroup using
dhcp agent isn't really needed. We are testing dhcp agents and
configuration of the IP addresses using DHCP in the tests from the
test_dhcp_agent module.
So this patch disables usage of the dhcp agent where it's not really
needed to save some resources (less agents running during tests) and to
minimize potential failures in the tests.

Additionally this patch also adds method
block_until_all_dhcp_config_done() to the FakeFullstackMachinesList
class and uses it in tests when fake VMs are using DHCP. That will
hopefully help better understand where the issue is in case of failures
like described in the related bug.

made this resource type unusable.

There is ansible role multi-node-setup which creates patch ports between
br-infra and br-ex bridges. It is need to provide connectivity to vms
which are on nodes other than controller in multinode setup.

That works fine when is run in pre-run phase by zuul but in ovn
multinode jobs, where devstack is installing ovs from source, we lost
all bridges setup done earlier by zuul. So we need to have
this command to create patch ports in some script so we can
run it again after ovn devstack plugin will install ovs from source.

Also update irrelevant-files to skip jobs which not
use multinode-setup role and playbook.

In ovn based jobs openvswitch is compliled and installed from source
during the devstack installation.
That is breaking CI infra multinode config which is done using
vxlan tunnels and ovs bridge which is created during pre-run
phase by multi-node-bridge zuul role.

So lets run script which will reconfigure what this zuul role did
after ovs is installed from source.

This change adds support for configuring Apt repositories on Ubuntu
hosts during host configuration.

Repositories are configured in a single file
(/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kayobe.sources), using the modern deb822
format [1]. This format is more flexible and readable than the original
single-line format, particularly if multiple options are used.

Using a single file allows us to more easily keep the set of
repositories in sync, since Ansible doesn't make it easy to clean things
up.

Support is added for marking repositories as signed by a particular GPG
key. This approach is now preferred over the deprecated [2] apt-key
tool, which resulted in a set of globally trusted keys.

It is also possible to disable the repositories in
/etc/apt/sources.list via apt_disable_sources_list. This allows for
replacing the standard repositories with a local mirror.

CI tests and documentation are provided.

Nova notifier logs for external events only provide the event
details without showing its connection to the associated request_id.

That complicates debugging of corner cases for external events as we
cannot be sure to which exact request a logged event is related.

Make the matching request_ids logged alongside external event
details, whenever it is available.

This patch explicitly calls sh binary to execute scripts from /tmp and

With [1] gateway is no longer set for subnet created
with prefix delegation, but when adding the subnet
to the router it fails as it expects gateway to be
set.

This patch ensures gateway is set temporary to the first IP
of the subnet as it used to be just like the temporary CIDR.
Also need to ensure dhcp configuration is skipped to avoid the
original issue[2].

This patch removes the ``IpAddressAllocationNotFound`` exception. This
exception was raised when a IPAM register was called to be deleted
but not found.

As reported in the LP bug, this IPAM register deletion can be called
several times if a port fails during the creation. The IPAM register
deletion calls the DB deletion but doesn't raise any exception if the
register does not exist. The code ensures the IPAM register is
deleted and there is no need to fail if it is not present anymore.

This patch also removes the exception catch and try in ""update_port"",
that was added in [0] as a fix for [1]. That was added because the
subnet deletion code involved a port update call [2] during the
IP allocation deletion, if any port was still present in the subnet.
Since [3], this code is not needed because the subnet deletion does
not call a port update anymore.

This change adds support for running the commands against Ubuntu hosts,

This patch removes the ``IpAddressAllocationNotFound`` exception. This
exception was raised when a IPAM register was called to be deleted
but not found.

As reported in the LP bug, this IPAM register deletion can be called
several times if a port fails during the creation. The IPAM register
deletion calls the DB deletion but doesn't raise any exception if the
register does not exist. The code ensures the IPAM register is
deleted and there is no need to fail if it is not present anymore.

This patch also removes the exception catch and try in ""update_port"",
that was added in [0] as a fix for [1]. That was added because the
subnet deletion code involved a port update call [2] during the
IP allocation deletion, if any port was still present in the subnet.
Since [3], this code is not needed because the subnet deletion does
not call a port update anymore.

As defined in RFC1035 section 3.3.14 TXT-DATA
can be one or more <character-strings>s.
Before this commit Designate threw errors
when saving TXT records that are split
into multiple strings because validations on
the field did not consider allowing this
in a single DNS record as per RFC7208
section 3.3.

This patch allows longer TXT record data
but only if it is split according to RFC
definitions mentioned above. If data
is made of more <character-string>s,
each one is individually validated with
the same validations as if the data was
not split.

If compute ironic pod migrates to another host,
old compute ironic service is not deleted and
in 'down' status forever. Unless it's deleted manually.
New compute ironic service is
created successfuly and in 'up' status.
This error behavior is due to host of compute
ironic service equals node name because of host networking.
The patch disables host networking which solves the issue.

When memcached is using IPv6 network, some parameters like
[keystone_authtoke] memcached_servers require each server name has
inet6 prefix, as is described in the following example.

This change introduces the global parameter so that puppet can detect

It also adds a missing method (_set_url_prefix) coverage in
Multistore cinder tests (test_multistore_cinder).

This change fixes the wrong section used by manila::network::standalone
to define the network_plugin_ipvN_enabled parameters.
Previously this usage resulted in duplicate resource declaration, and
made this resource type unusable.

This change also replaces usage of undef by $::os_service_default.
These two are effectively same but $::os_service_default is now
globally used.

Whitebox is a tempest plugin whose scope specifically includes peaking
behind the curtain. It is used for integration tests that cannot
perform their assertions based on just the REST API, which is the
limit in Tempest proper. Whitebox allows things like examining the
instance XML and querying the database. While it is not limited to
Nova in theory, in practice at the time of this commit, it only
contains compute-related tests.

This patch adds the basic integration job that whitebox uses in its
own CI to Nova's periodic weekly pipeline. Whitebox does a lof of
tests around CPU pinning, and therefore uses nodepool labels that
provide nested KVM support. For that reason, it's considered wasteful
to run it against every single Nova patch, so periodic is being
proposed here.

As a periodic job, its status will have to be a recurring item on the
Nova team meeting, similar to how the Placement periodic job is
treated.

In addition, we also add it to the experimental pipeline to allow for
manual trigger if deemed necessary on any particular patch.

The functional test job didn't specify default branches
for repositories it depended on, leading to a graph freeze failure
on stable branches with irregular names.

This patch sets the devstack repos as a dependency and
explicitly specifies the branches to be used.

Tox includes a couple of enhancements:

- [1] previously mishandled the basepython directive.
- previously ignored PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE [2]

So we can remove the workarounds.

Currently, ""Resize instance"" widget is not working because it relies on
legacy Nova API v2.46, obsoleted in Pike release. Proposed patch make
Horizon use current Nova API (>=2.47).

Note: It also cherry-picks a7956cd004 from the master branch
which avoids the extra call of flavor_get in resize server form.

Reverted commit 031475d42e [1] which changed tox_install_siblings to
false in base job ansible-collections-openstack-functional-devstack.
This caused most jobs to install the latest Python packages of
OpenStack SDK and other requirements from PyPI to tox' virtualenv
instead of respecting the override-checkout keywords.

Dropped job ansible-collections-openstack-functional-devstack-ansible-\
new_sdk because its a duplicate of job ansible-collections-openstack-\
functional-devstack-ansible-2.12.

Dropped inherited variables such as tox_envlist or voting, removed
redundant entries in required-projects such as openstack/openstacksdk
and deleted unused YAML anchors such as irr_files and ooo_files from
jobs.

Constrained jobs ansible-collections-openstack-functional-devstack-\
octavia and ansible-collections-openstack-functional-devstack-releases
to use 0.* releases of OpenStack SDK only. Latest releases of OpenStack
SDK will soon be 1.* versioned which our stable/1.0.0 branch is
incompatible with. Job ansible-collections-openstack-functional-\
devstack will also use the latest 0.* release branch of OpenStack SDK.

Replaced test-requirements*.txt files for installing different Ansible
releases with a single tests/pip-requirements.txt which installs the
latest Ansible release. To constrain Ansible releases, we use
tests/pip-constraints-*.txt files now. In Zuul jobs, specific Ansible
releases are choosen with keyword override-checkout and installed using
variable tox_install_siblings.

Rationale for constraining Ansible releases using the previous
test-requirements*.txt and the new tests/pip-constraints-*.txt files is
that Ansible 2.9 or earlier cannot be upgraded to Ansible 2.10 or 3.*
(ansible-base 2.10) and Ansible 2.10/3.* cannot be upgraded to Ansible
4.* (ansible-core 2.11) or later [4]. So to use tox_install_siblings in
Zuul jobs, the installed Ansible release must (roughly) match the
siblings release which is about to be installed.

Release-specific tox environments such as testenv:linters-* and
testenv:ansible-* are obsolete with the introduction of aforementioned
pip constraints etc. and thus have been dropped.

Reparented ansible-collections-openstack-functional-devstack-{xena,\
wallaby,train}-ansible-2.{11,12} jobs from ansible-collections-\
openstack-functional-devstack-ansible-devel to corresponding ansible-\
collections-openstack-functional-devstack-ansible-2.{9,11,12} jobs
because the previous inheritance hierarchy had no benefits. The new
hierarchy saves voting overrides and allows to jobs to inherit pip
constraints for the specified ansible releases. Since OpenStack SDK
0.* releases are only supported by our stable/1.0.0 branch we restrict
those jobs to run only on patches for our stable/1.0.0 branch.

Run Zuul jobs which test against the master branch of OpenStack SDK
only for commits on our master branch because branch stable/1.0.0 is
compatible only to OpenStack SDK 0.* releases.

Added job openstack-tox-linters-ansible which is a parent of and
defines generic properties for all linter jobs.

Reverted commit 1f3417cdef [2] which disabled check-import.sh script.
Python module galaxy_importer will return a non-zero return value on
errors since commit 4f5fd0f29c [3].

Both galaxy.yml and galaxy.yml.in have been synchronized.

Reverted commit 031475d42e [1] which changed tox_install_siblings to
false in base job ansible-collections-openstack-functional-devstack.
This caused most jobs to install the latest Python packages of
OpenStack SDK and other requirements from PyPI to tox' virtualenv
instead of respecting the override-checkout keywords.

Dropped job ansible-collections-openstack-functional-devstack-ansible-\
new_sdk because its a duplicate of job ansible-collections-openstack-\
functional-devstack-ansible-2.12.

Dropped inherited variables such as tox_envlist or voting, removed
redundant entries in required-projects such as openstack/openstacksdk
and deleted unused YAML anchors such as irr_files and ooo_files from
jobs.

Replaced test-requirements*.txt files for installing different Ansible
releases with a single tests/pip-requirements.txt which installs the
latest Ansible release. To constrain Ansible releases, we use
tests/pip-constraints-*.txt files now. In Zuul jobs, specific Ansible
releases are choosen with keyword override-checkout and installed using
variable tox_install_siblings.

Rationale for constraining Ansible releases using the previous
test-requirements*.txt and the new tests/pip-constraints-*.txt files is
that Ansible 2.9 or earlier cannot be upgraded to Ansible 2.10 or 3.*
(ansible-base 2.10) and Ansible 2.10/3.* cannot be upgraded to Ansible
4.* (ansible-core 2.11) or later [4]. So to use tox_install_siblings in
Zuul jobs, the installed Ansible release must (roughly) match the
siblings release which is about to be installed.

Release-specific tox environments such as testenv:linters-* and
testenv:ansible-* are obsolete with the introduction of aforementioned
pip constraints etc. and thus have been dropped.

Reparented ansible-collections-openstack-functional-devstack-{xena,\
wallaby,train}-ansible-2.{11,12} jobs from ansible-collections-\
openstack-functional-devstack-ansible-devel to corresponding ansible-\
collections-openstack-functional-devstack-ansible-2.{9,11,12} jobs
because the previous inheritance hierarchy had no benefits. The new
hierarchy saves voting overrides and allows to jobs to inherit pip
constraints for the specified ansible releases. Since OpenStack SDK
0.* releases are only supported by our stable/1.0.0 branch we restrict
those jobs to run only on patches for our stable/1.0.0 branch.

Run Zuul jobs which test against the master branch of OpenStack SDK
only for commits on our master branch because branch stable/1.0.0 is
compatible only to OpenStack SDK 0.* releases.

Added job openstack-tox-linters-ansible which is a parent of and
defines generic properties for all linter jobs.

Reverted commit 1f3417cdef [2] which disabled check-import.sh script.
Python module galaxy_importer will return a non-zero return value on
errors since commit 4f5fd0f29c [3].

Both galaxy.yml and galaxy.yml.in have been synchronized.

Managing a volume to an encrypted volume type should not be allowed.
One reason is that there is no way for an operator to specify an
encryption key ID for the volume. Another is that we already don't
allow a volume of an encrypted type to be un-managed, so this change
will be symmetric.

Also update and correct the api-ref for this call.

Currently, ""Resize instance"" widget is not working because it relies on
legacy Nova API v2.46, obsoleted in Pike release. Proposed patch make
Horizon use current Nova API (>=2.47).

Note: It also cherry-picks a7956cd004 from the master branch
which avoids the extra call of flavor_get in resize server form.

This follows other clustered services (like RabbitMQ) and
uses *_node_names (which contain FQDNs), instead of *_node_ips.

Certificate for Memcached TLS is also created using FQDN.
Because of this, validation failed when using pymemcache.
This patch fixes this issue.

Currently tox jobs are broken because python-glareclient can't be
installed with the latest constraints.

The conflict is caused by:
    python-cinderclient 8.3.0 depends on PrettyTable>=0.7.2
    python-glanceclient 3.6.0 depends on PrettyTable>=0.7.1
    python-glareclient 0.5.3 depends on PrettyTable<0.8 and >=0.7.1

The Glare project has been unmaintained for a while[1]. It does not
support any of the current tested runtime and is considered to be
incompatible with recent OpenStack releases.

Because of these points, this change removes dependency on Glare.
Deprecation step is skipped to unblock CI jobs.

Also, this change removes the broken lower constraints job. It was
removed from Mistral a while ago[2] from the Mistral repo.

* The ""devstack_localrc"" key was missing, without it local.conf won't be

* Added OVN_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE to True to make sure OVN is compiled
from code and not installed from packages.

* Updated the version of OVN and OVS in the -released job to a newer
  version.

* Configure correct db user in the functional tests job
  This was changed in the Neutron in commit [1] and should
  be updated also in the configure_functional_tests role in
  this repo.

* Remove run-devstack role from run_functional_job playbook
  There is no need to run that role in the functional
  job and not running it can save few minutes in each job's run.

This change adds support for configuring Apt repositories on Ubuntu
hosts during host configuration.

Repositories are configured in a single file
(/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kayobe.sources), using the modern deb822
format [1]. This format is more flexible and readable than the original
single-line format, particularly if multiple options are used.

Using a single file allows us to more easily keep the set of
repositories in sync, since Ansible doesn't make it easy to clean things
up.

Support is added for marking repositories as signed by a particular GPG
key. This approach is now preferred over the deprecated [2] apt-key
tool, which resulted in a set of globally trusted keys.

It is also possible to disable the repositories in
/etc/apt/sources.list via apt_disable_sources_list. This allows for
replacing the standard repositories with a local mirror.

CI tests and documentation are provided.

Recent move to centos9 nodes has disabled the jobs we rely on.
By moving our jobs to centos9 we can keep our coverage.

The reqcheck job no longer pulls python3-virtualenv package
as it was removed from centos9 stream.

The molecule jobs have been kept on centos-8.

Recent move to centos9 nodes has disabled the jobs we rely on.
By moving our jobs to centos9 we can keep our coverage.

The reqcheck job no longer pulls python3-virtualenv package
as it was removed from centos8 stream.

In some places of which network environment was limited, ciro can't
pull images from k8s.gcr.io. This patch add a variable
`CRIO_PAUSE_IMAGE` in order to the developer who located in these
places can set the ciro to pull pause container images from
repository that they can access.

The `CRIO_PAUSE_COMMAND` used to configure crio's `pause_command`
(the pause container's bootstrap command), in order to the developer
can use the special pause image the they customized.

Hugepages management was always a manual step done by operators via the
TripleO parameter ``KernelArgs``. This is error prone and causing confusion.

The new ``Hugepages`` parameter allow operators to define hugepages as
dictionnary, making it easier to read and follow.

To prevent unvolontary changes, there's multiple validations before
applying a change:
- We convert the current running configurations to an actual dictionnary
  that we validate the new format against
- If no change is necessary, even though the format might not be the same,
  there's no kernel_args update.
- By default, we don't remove hugepages in places except when operators
  specifically set the ``ReconfigureHugepages`` to true.

This change is also opening the door to more automations and automatic
tuning.

Hugepages management was always a manual steps done by operators via the
TripleO parameter KernelArgs. This is error prone and causing confusion.

The new tripleo_kernel_hugepages setting allow operators to define
hugepages as dictionnary, making it easier to read and follow.

To prevent unvolontary changes, there's multiple validations before
applying a change:
- We convert the current running configurations to an actual dictionnary
  that we validate the new format against
- If no change is necessary, even though the format might not be the same,
  there's no kernel_args update.
- By default, we don't remove hugepages in places except when operators
  specifically set the tripleo_kernel_hugepages_remove to true.

This change also includes 4 new molecule scenarios that will help with
consistency.

It is also opening the door to more automations and automatic tuning.

Add the ability to replace an overcloud node that's running the etcd
service by updating the etcd cluster's membership to delete the old
node (the one being replaced) with the new replacement node.

etcd maintains its cluster membership using each node's name and it's
cluster peer address on the internal_api network. This data typically
changes when replacing an overcloud node. The cluster membership is
updated using a shell script that's triggered to run after etcd is
deployed on the new node.

A new EtcdInitialClusterState parameter is introduced. It defaults
to ""new,"" and only needs to be set to ""existing"" when the cluster
membership changes.

This patch updates the message being logged after the flow manager
creates a volume from backup.  When the flow manager called the driver
to try and do a backend assisted restore and the driver doesn't support
that, the log entry said it created the volume successfully.  This was
incorrect as the volume wasn't finished.  The raw volume was created,
but the data hadn't been copied into the volume yet.  This is a
confusing message when trying to debug the process for failures in
production.

This patch updates the log message to only say successfull when the
driver assisted restore is implemented and worked.

With ""hostPid: true"" we want the entrypoint process to be libvirtd not a wrapper so that process lifecycle management works as expected.

The fix for now is

  * start libvirtd
  * create secrets (libvirtd needs to be running for this)
  * kill it

then start it again using exec so libvirtd is the entrypoint pid
and container lifecycle should work as expected.

Currently, ""Resize instance"" widget is not working because it relies on
legacy Nova API v2.46, obsoleted in Pike release. Proposed patch make
Horizon use current Nova API (>=2.47).

Note: It also cherry-picks a7956cd004 from the master branch
which avoids the extra call of flavor_get in resize server form.

Due to a build problem with the reactive plugin, this change falls back
on overriding the steps and doing a manual build, but it also ensures
the CI system builds the charm using charmcraft.  Changes:

- add a build-requirements.txt
- modify charmcraft.yaml
- modify osci.yaml
    -> indicate build with charmcraft
- modify tox.ini
    -> tox -e build does charmcraft build/rename
    -> tox -e build-reactive does the reactive build
- modify bundles to use the <charm>.charm artifact in tests.
  and fix deprecation warning re: prefix
- tox inception to enable tox -e func-test in the CI

This change also re-enables the gate for Xena.

For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html To test out your formatting, see http://www.tele3.cz/jbar/rest/rest.html =================================================== Align Prometheus metrics exporters to any LMA stack =================================================== The OpenStack charms (except Ceph) do not currently support metrics gathering on their components. On the other hand, Prometheus is the product maintained by Canonical, and the technology operations teams are heading to. Operations teams currently use a non-productized LMA stack (in short, “old LMA stack”), which supports machine charms: `charm-grafana <https://launchpad.net/charm-grafana>`_ , `charm-prometheus2 <https://launchpad.net/charm-prometheus2>`_ and others. This suite already supports three Ceph dashboards, a Telegraf host metrics dashboard, and an OpenStack exporter (collecting metrics via the API endpoints). Furthermore, the Observability product team is currently developing a new LMA stack, which supports container charms: `grafana-operator <https://github.com/canonical/grafana-operator/>`_, `prometheus-operator <https://github.com/canonical/prometheus-operator/>`_ and others. Problem Description =================== The goal of this spec is to standardize the Juju interfaces required (and their logic) on OpenStack charms in order to facilitate Prometheus metrics collection (via Prometheus charms) and dashboards exports (via Grafana charms), no matter which LMA stack is used. Proposed Change =============== At the time of writing this spec, there are 2 efforts being carried out: 1. Prometheus bind exporter to monitor charm-designate-bind; 2. Prometheus haproxy exporters to monitor the haproxy services from all the OpenStack API charms; Bind ---- BIND service does not support a built-in Prometheus metrics exporter. However, this service can expose a statistics channel, used by an intermediary to retrieve details (see bind-exporter service [1]). In a similar way to charm-prometheus-ceph-exporter, a new charm (prometheus-bind-exporter-operator) would relate to the bind charm (in this case, charm-designate-bind) and to the Prometheus charm. Furthermore, prometheus-bind-exporter-operator would also relate to the Grafana charm to share a rendered template with an optimized Grafana dashboard. Snap prometheus-bind-exporter ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ A go-plugin and a simple daemon will be used to create the snap service (see `MP [3] <https://code.launchpad.net/~rgildein/prometheus-bind-exporter-snap/+git/prometheus-bind-exporter-snap/+merge/408138>`_). .. code-block:: yaml apps: prometheus-bind-exporter: plugs: [network, network-bind] daemon: simple parts: prometheus-bind-exporter: plugin: go source: https://github.com/prometheus-community/bind_exporter.git The configuration will be managed using the snap get and snap set commands, with a list of possible configurations below. * **bind**.stats-url=""http://localhost:8053/"" - HTTP XML API address of BIND server * **bind**.timeout=10s - Timeout for trying to get stats from BIND server * **bind**.pid-file=""/run/named/named.pid"" - Path to BIND's pid file to export process information * **bind**.stats-version=auto - BIND statistics version. Can be detected automatically * **bind**.stats-groups=server,view,tasks - Comma-separated list of statistics to collect * **web**.config.file="""" - [EXPERIMENTAL] Path to configuration file that can enable TLS or authentication * **web**.listen-address="":9119"" - Address to listen on for web interface and telemetry * **web**.telemetry-path=""/metrics"" - Path under which to expose metrics Charm prometheus-bind-exporter-operator ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This is a subordinate charm that will provide a bind-exporter service installed by the snap, to export metrics from BIND. At the same time with the help of relations, this charm will share the data needed to create a target in Prometheus and basic dashboard for Grafana. **Configuration options:** * **exporter-listen-port** - The prometheus-bind-exporter port to listen on for web interface and telemetry. * **exporter-stats-groups** - Comma-separated list of statistics to collect by the prometheus-bind-exporter. **Relations:** Requires: * **bind-stats:bind-client** - The relation that serves to add charm as a subordinate, also the parent should provide hostname and port through this relation, otherwise the default values will be used (hostname=127.0.0.1, port=8053). Provides: * **bind-exporter:http** - The relation connecting this charm with the Prometheus charm, while providing hostname and port through which it will collect all the metrics in Prometheus. * **grafana:grafana-dashboard** - The relation connecting this charm with the Grafana charm and at the same time responsible for creating a new dashboard. **Actions**: This charm requires no action Charm designate-bind ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This charm needs to expose a statistics service for bind whenever it is related with the prometheus-bind-exporter-operator subordinate charm. The **stats.conf** will have the following content: .. code-block:: none statistics-channels { inet <stats-listen-net> port <stats-port> allow { <client-ip>; }; }; Where stats-listen-net, stats-port and client-ip default values are 127.0.0.1, 8053 and 127.0.0.1, respectively. This will open a statistics channel in bind that prometheus-bind-exporter can expose metrics for prometheus to collect. This new configuration file will be included at **/etc/bind/named.conf** appending the following content: .. code-block:: none include ""/etc/bind/stats.conf""; When a prometheus-bind-exporter is removed, it will trigger the reactive endpoint logic for departed that will be responsible for removing the **stats.conf, named.conf** files and removing it from the restart_map. **Configuration options** * **stats-port**- Port used to open the statistics channel in bind that prometheus-bind-exporter will use to expose metrics to prometheus. * **stats-listen-net** - A network block is shared (optionally) and the bind statistics service will listen on the IP that is part of such network. If ""all"" or 0.0.0.0/0 is given, the service will listen on all IP addresses of the unit. By default, the service should listen on localhost (as shared in the ""default"" attribute). **Relations:** Provides: * **bind-stats:bind-client** - The relation that serves to colocate the bind-exporter charm on each unit. Optionally, the charm should share a port for the subordinate charm service to connect to the statistics service from bind.[port=8053]. **Note**: In order to enable this interface, a new interface (bind-client) will be created, maintained by the DevOps Centres, and the repo and docs links added in `layer-index <https://github.com/juju/layer-index>`_. **Actions**: This charm requires no action HAproxy ------- HAProxy enterprise Edition and from `version 2.0 <https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy-exposes-a-prometheus-metrics-endpoint/>`_ also HAProxy community edition has built-in support to export metrics to Prometheus via Prometheus exporter. To take advantage of the Prometheus exporter, changes need to be made in the **haproxy.cfg** file in the stats section. .. code-block:: yaml listen stats: mode http stats enable bind {{ stats_exporter_host }}:{{ stats_exporter_port }} option http-use-htx http-request use-service prometheus-exporter if { path /metrics } To see more information about **stats_exporter_host** and **stats_exporter_port**, see the Charmhelpers >> haproxy.cfg section below. Implementation For the legacy charms the implementation should be splitted into four parts: * editing **haproxy.cfg** config file - by **charmhelpers** (see section below) * providing and rendering Grafana dashboard template - by **charmhelpers** (see section below) * adding configuration options - by charm itself * adding and managing relations changes - by charm itself Charmhelpers ^^^^^^^^^^^^ **haproxy.cfg** The charmhelpers library implements the code responsible for creating the context of **haproxy.cfg**, because of that it will be also responsible for adding parts needed to enable prometheus exporter. The prometheus exporter will be enabled only if these conditions are met: * haproxy version is above 2.0 * Haproxy-exporter relation exists If both conditions are satisfied, then two values will be needed: * **stats_exporter_host** - obtain IP address from relation (aka. using “get_relation_ip”) * **stats_exporter_port** - obtain from “haproxy-exporter-stats-port” config options (could be changed via Juju config) **Dashboard** Charmhelpers will include the dashboard template, which will be rendered by the render_grafana_dashboard function. This function needs the name of the prometheus application name, obtained from relation and will be used to create datasource. Charms ^^^^^^ There are several charms, which will take advantage of the availability to export HAProxy metrics to Prometheus and may follow this specification. Here is list of them: * charm-ceilometer * charm-ceph-radosgw * charm-keystone * charm-neutron-api * charm-nova-cloud-controller * charm-openstack-dashboard * charm-cinder * charm-glance * charm-heat * charm-swift-proxy * charm-designate * charm-neutron-gateway * charm-percona-cluster * charm-vault The charm-keystone has been already implemented and there is a `proposal <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/charm-keystone/+/804760>`_. **Configuration options** * **haproxy-exporter-stats-port** - The port on which Prometheus exporter will be provided. **Relations** Provides: * **haproxy-exporter:http** - The relation connecting this charm with the Prometheus charm, while providing hostname and port through which it will collect all the metrics in Prometheus. * **grafana:grafana-dashboard** - The relation connecting this charm with the Grafana charm and at the same time responsible for creating a new dashboard. This relation will use the function `render_grafana_dashboard <https://github.com/juju/charm-helpers/blob/bf9c2d83ed579ffb369abbb687fbdf2de62b4d54/charmhelpers/contrib/openstack/ha/utils.py#L353>`_ from charmhelpers to obtain rendered dashboard as string and then it will update relation data with {""dashboard"": rendered_dashboard_as_str}. The relation data should be updated only for the whole application, not per specific unit. **Actions**: No actions required.

Python 2 support was removed during Ussuri cycle. This change adds
the classifier to clearly state that only Python 3 is supported.

Note that the python 3 only classifier was already added to the other

Bandit has fixed the problem.

Sphinx 2.0 no longer works on python 2.7, so we need to start capping

Since msgpack 0.6.0, some limits were introduced for the
deserializer which were put in to avoid any denial of service
attacks using msgpack.  These limits were raised to 100MiB
in the release of msgpack 1.0.0.

The default buffer sizes that were implemented were quite low
and when running certain `privsep` commands, especially for
Neutron when using linux bridge, where there is a large amount
of netdevs, privsep would crash since msgpack would fail to
decode the message since it considers it too big:

  ValueError: 1174941 exceeds max_str_len(1048576)

In this commit, the `max_buffer_size` is bumped to the value
that ships with msgpack==1.0.0 to allow for users who don't
have that to continue to function. Also, since `msgpack` is
only being used by the internal API, we're not worried about
a third party coming in and overwhelming the system by
deserializing calls.

This fix also addresses some weird behaviour where privsep
will die and certain OpenStack agents would start to behave
in a strange way once they hit a certain number of ports (since
any privsep calls would start to fail).

We were using pkg_resources for runtime package version lookups but
pkg_resources incurs a pretty significant cost to use it in thise way
(because it scans all installed packages on disk and sorts them).

importlib-metadata is the way of the future (part of stdlib in
python3.8) and is supposed to be significantly more performant. Replace
our use of pkg_resources for runtime version lookups with
importlib-metadata so that we are both quicker and future proof.

probably end up needing to vendor importlib-metadata in pbr or something

This patch removes the ``IpAddressAllocationNotFound`` exception. This
exception was raised when a IPAM register was called to be deleted
but not found.

As reported in the LP bug, this IPAM register deletion can be called
several times if a port fails during the creation. The IPAM register
deletion calls the DB deletion but doesn't raise any exception if the
register does not exist. The code ensures the IPAM register is
deleted and there is no need to fail if it is not present anymore.

This patch also removes the exception catch and try in ""update_port"",
that was added in [0] as a fix for [1]. That was added because the
subnet deletion code involved a port update call [2] during the
IP allocation deletion, if any port was still present in the subnet.
Since [3], this code is not needed because the subnet deletion does
not call a port update anymore.

We need to specify doc requirements in doc/requirements.txt
to avoid problems with the pip resolver [1] for the release team [2][3].
Removed specific doc requirements from test-requirements.txt.

The problem here is that this repos haven't doc/requirements.txt file
and by default in this case zuul will use the test-requirements.txt file
to pull requirements [4].

This requirements file contains extra requirements like flake8 that
collided with those allowed in our job environment and so the new pip
resolver fails to install these requirements and the job exits in error.

This project meet the conditions leading to the bug.

When OpenStack is deployed with Kolla-Ansible, by default there
are no durable queues or exchanges created by the OpenStack
services in RabbitMQ. In Rabbit terminology, not being durable
is referred to as `transient`, and this means that the queue
is generally held in memory.

Whether OpenStack services create durable or transient queues is
traditionally controlled by the Oslo Notification config option:
`amqp_durable_queues`. In Kolla-Ansible, this remains set to
the default of `False` in all services. The only `durable`
objects are the `amq*` exchanges which are internal to RabbitMQ.

More recently, Oslo Notification has introduced support for
Quorum queues [7]. These are a successor to durable classic
queues, however it isn't yet clear if they are a good fit for
OpenStack in general [8].

For clustered RabbitMQ deployments, Kolla-Ansible configures all
queues as `replicated` [1]. Replication occurs over all nodes
in the cluster. RabbitMQ refers to this as 'mirroring of classic
queues'.

In summary, this means that a multi-node Kolla-Ansible deployment
will end up with a large number of transient, mirrored queues
and exchanges. However, the RabbitMQ documentation warns against
this, stating that 'For replicated queues, the only reasonable
option is to use durable queues: [2]`. This is discussed
further in the following bug report: [3].

Whilst we could try enabling the `amqp_durable_queues` option
for each service (this is suggested in [4]), there are
a number of complexities with this approach, not limited to:

1) RabbitMQ is planning to remove classic queue mirroring in
   favor of 'Quorum queues' in a forthcoming release [5].
2) Durable queues will be written to disk, which may cause
   performance problems at scale. Note that this includes
   Quorum queues which are always durable.
3) Potential for race conditions and other complexity
   discussed recently on the mailing list under:
   `[ops] [kolla] RabbitMQ High Availability`

The remaining option, proposed here, is to use classic
non-mirrored queues everywhere, and rely on services to recover
if the node hosting a queue or exchange they are using fails.
There is some discussion of this approach in [6]. The downside
of potential message loss needs to be weighed against the real
upsides of increasing the performance of RabbitMQ, and moving
to a configuration which is officially supported and hopefully
more stable. In the future, we can then consider promoting
specific queues to quorum queues, in cases where message loss
can result in failure states which are hard to recover from.

We need to specify doc requirements in doc/requirements.txt to avoid

specific doc requirements from test-requirements.txt.

The problem here is that this repos haven't doc/requirements.txt file

to pull requirements [4].

This requirements file contains extra requirements like flake8 that
collided with those allowed in our job environment and so the new pip
resolver fails to install these requirements and the job exits in error.

Managing a volume to an encrypted volume type should not be allowed.
One reason is that there is no way for an operator to specify an
encryption key ID for the volume. Another is that we already don't
allow a volume of an encrypted type to be un-managed, so this change
will be symmetric.

Also update and correct the api-ref for this call.

It's a common practice to have /tmp/ mounted separately with noexec
option. This effectively means no scripts can be executed from the
filesystem mounted to /tmp.

This patch explicitly calls sh binary to execute scripts from /tmp and
removes the executable flag from the scripts.

For ingress bandwidth limiting openvswitch agent is using QoS and queues
from the Open vSwitch. There is always queue 0 used for that purpose.
Initially, when this feature was implemented, we assumed that queue 0 is
kind of the ""default"" queue to which all traffic will be send if there
are no other queues. But that's not true thus ingress bandwidth limiting
wasn't working properly with this agent.

This patch fixes that issue but adding in the table=0 of the br-int
additional OF rule to send all traffic to the queue 0.
In this queue for some ports there can be QoS configured
and then it will be applied for the port. If port don't have any QoS
configured, nothing will happen and all will work like before this
patch.

Biggest problem with that solution was the case when also ports with
minimum bandwidth are on the same node becuase such ports are using
different queues (queue number is the same as ofport number of the tap
interface).
In case when traffic is going from the port with minimum bandwidth QoS
to the port which has ingress bw limit configured, traffic is going only
through br-int and will use queue 0 to apply ingress bw limit properly.
In case when traffic from port with minimum bandwidth set needs to go
out from the host, it will always use physical bridge (minimum bandwidth
is only supported for the provider networks) and proper queue will be
set for such traffic in the physical bridge.
To be able to set proper queue in the physical bridge, this patch adds
additional OF rule to the br-int to set queue_num value in the pkt_mark
field [1] as this seems to be only field which can ""survive"" passing
bridges.

Added log volumes for ceilometer-agent-ipmi as it turns out all
polling from ceilometer-agent-ipmi are written inside the container
namespace and never goes down to /var/log/containers/ceilometer
which makes this container size increase over time as well as
avoiding any kind of log rotation.

The shutdown script for the elasticsearch-data container uses a trap
handler to run the steps outlined in the rolling restart procedure [0].
However, when trying to kill the elasticsearch process (step 3), the
script sends the TERM signal to itself.

The traps are handled recursively, causing the entire termination grace
period to be exhausted before the pod is finally removed.

This change updates the trap handler to terminate the child process(es)
instead, and wait for their completion.
