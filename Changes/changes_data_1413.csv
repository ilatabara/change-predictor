When tox 'docs' target is called, first it installs the dependencies
(listed in 'deps') in 'installdeps' phase, then it installs murano
(with its requirements) in 'develop-inst' phase. In the latter case
'deps' is not used so that the constraints defined in 'deps' are not
used. This could lead to failures on stable branches when new packages
are released that break the build. To avoid this, the simplest solution
is to pre-install requirements, i.e. add requirements.txt to 'docs' tox
target.

Commit includes:
* New package type Aspect which will have extended MuranoPL
  reflection capabilities. At this stage methods inside this type
  of packages have the ability to modify properties of any object
* New classes io.murano.policy.Aspect and io.murano.policy.Notifier
* Every aspect instance can subscribe to notifications of
  different events. For now it is only object initialization event.
  To subscribe, it passes itself, name of handler method and name
  of method to check some condition against the processed object
  to notifier's subscribe() method
* Example policy package that inforces usage of some maximum
  instance flavor with test-runner based tests

So now it is possible:
* to write custom aspect code in the form of library package
* to define the aspect rules in json-format and place it to the file
  murano/common/aspects.py (until db tables and api are implemented)
* aspects are notified of the objects initializing event
* aspects can modify the values of object's properties

Since nova api version 2.37,  `networks` entry is required for the server
creation[1]. Plus a heat change[2] in release Rocky removes old workaround.
Therefore instance creation through heat orchestraction template needs
`networks` property of OS::Nova::Server resource in template.

While murano core library not passing this property to heat template makes
it fail to work with Rocky release heat.

The patch passes in `Auto` value to networks object for Instance class.

As a new feature, os-brick now supports setting the location of file
locks in a different location from the locks of the service.

The functionality is intended for HCI deployments and hosts that are
running Cinder and Glance using Cinder backend.  In those scenarios the
service can use a service specific location for its file locks while
only sharing the location of os-brick with the other services.

To leverage this functionality the new os-brick code is needed and
method ``os_brick.setup`` needs to be called once the service
configuration options have been loaded.

The default value of the os-brick ``lock_path`` is the one set in
``oslo_concurrency``.

This patch adds support for this new feature in a non backward
compatible way, so it requires an os-brick version bump in the
requirements.

The patch also ensures that ``tox -egenconfig`` includes the os-brick
configuration options when generating the sample config.

This change adds the healthcheck tracker to the nova
context object by extedning the context module with a
module global _HEALTH_TRACKER and register_healthcheck_tracker
function. The RequestContext __init__ method is extended
with a health_tracker kwarg and the get_context and get_admin_context
functions are modifyied to pass _HEALTH_TRACKER.

These change allow the health tracker to be accessed from
any function that is passed the context object enabling fine grained
health checks to be added in future patches.

This change adds the heathcheck manager to to
the service instances via the pre_start_hook

It also stubs out the healthcheck manager from
all tests that are not explictly testing it.

The healthcheck manager is initalized with the
service_ref.uuid, To enable this we also need to
set a uuid in the defualt fake service created
in the compute manager BaseTestCase.

This change adds the healthcheck module and config options.

Currently these are not used and they will be enabled in a
later patch in the series.

You can test the healthcheck module locally by simply
importing the module and constructing the endpoint.
e.g.

from nova.healthcheck import manager as hm
hm.CONF.healthcheck.uri = 'tcp://0.0.0.0:42424'
manager = hm.HealthcheckManager('1', 'nova-api')
manager.sleep(10)

The manager.sleep is only needed in interactive
python shell to yield to the eventlet eventloop.
Once the manager is created in another terminal
you can use curl or any other client to test the endpoint
e.g.
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:42424/health

When Nova receives a volume-extended external server event and the
status of the extended volume is 'extending', it will now notify Cinder
of success or failure when handling the event by using the new
os-extend_volume_completion volume action.

This change incidentally also fixes an issue where nova-compute would
create an instance action entry indicating success despite encountering
errors when extended the volume.

Last year cri-o project has followed kubernetes and move its builds to
new repository[1]. Starting from version 1.28 all the builds will be
available only from the new location. The old one still preserves older
builds, but it's difficult to make them work effortlessly, especially

A couple of years ago[0] we moved the tempurl signature generation from
a tool inside swift to a sub command in the client. This made a lot of
sense.
This patch does the same thing for formpost. It adds a new `formpost`
sub command to the swiftclient shell. And a generate formpost signature
helper method to utils, so now we can:

  swift formpost 500 5 ""/v1/a/c"" ""some_key"" --redirect 'http://gohere.example' --digest sha256 --max-file-count 1
  500, 5, /v1/a/c, some_key

  Signature: 333de753c27f4d0d81d6bfa35af19da803d2b1f9ea90219973db846a2fe3e1d7

  Sample form:
  NOTE: the <form> tag's ""action"" attribute does not obtain the Swift cluster's
        hostname. You should manually add it before using the form.

  <form action=""/v1/a/c"" method=""POST"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">

    <!-- Remove file inputs as needed. -->
    <input type=""file"" name=""file0"" />

    <input type=""submit"" />

Where the order of commands are:

  Usage: swift formpost [--digest <digest>] [--redirect <url>] [--max-file-count <count>] <path>
                        <max_file_size> <seconds> <key>
  Generate Form Signature

  positional arguments:
    <time>                The amount of time the form post will be
                          valid. The time can be specified in three ways:
                          an integer representing the time in seconds;
                          a number with a 's', 'm', 'h', or 'd' suffix to specify
                          the time in seconds, minutes, hours, or days; or
                          an ISO 8601 timestamp in a specific format.
                          If --absolute is passed and time is an integer, the
                          seconds are intepreted as the Unix timestamp when the
                          temporary URL will expire.
                          The ISO 8601 timestamp can be specified in one of
                          following formats:

                          i) Complete date: YYYY-MM-DD (eg 1997-07-16)

                          ii) Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds:

                              YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss

                             (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30)

                          iii) Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds with
                               UTC designator:

                               (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30Z)

                          Please be aware that if you don't provide the UTC
                          designator (i.e., Z) the timestamp is generated using
                          your local timezone. If only a date is specified,
                          the time part used will equal to 00:00:00.
    max_file_size         The maximum file size per file uploaded.
    path                  The prefix to use for form uploaded objects. For
                          example: /v1/account/container/object_prefix_ would
                          ensure all form uploads have that path prepended to
                          the browser-given file name.
    key                   The X-{Account|Container}-Meta-Temp-URL-Key for the

Metalsmith is generally used as a frontend for baremetal
provisioning such that a user can ask for baremetal to be
deployed with a simplified command line. The challenge is
it artificially hydrates together data from several queries
to return a list of instances which have been deployed
or are managed using metalsmith. The challenge is if someone
didn't create an allocation record, or if someone used the
metalsmith modules to do so when the node was in a maintenance
state, for example if BMC communication was not working.

The underlying challenge is this results in a lack of an allocation
record from being created. This can be manually corrected, and instead
of providing a vague error, metalsmith now provides a detailed error
with the command to remedy the error state through manual creation of
the allocation record, which allows ""metalsmith list"" to work as
expected.

There's a potential deadlock when creating the first LB in a new
project. The query that creates an empty quota object for the project
may have triggered a deadlock in the DB, this deadlock should have been
handlded by an oslo_db.api.wrab_db_retry decorator but the decorated
function was incorrect called: the DB session must begin in the
decorated function and not in the caller.
If begin is called by the caller, in case of retry sqlalchemy will
complain that the session was not correctly restarted after a rollback.

Behavior: In the response body of the LB API when creating
a new load balancer, the information about the health
monitor is always null, even though it has been configured.

Reproduce: Using the Octavia API to create a new LB with
all components. You cannot see any information about the
health monitor that will be returned.

Proposed Fix: Modify the assignment to use
`data_model.health_monitor` instead of `pool.healthmonitor`.

The up scripts of the interface files were called only when the
interface moved from down to up, it means that they were not called
during the update of the configuration of an interface. So if during an
update, if an ipv6 subnet was plugged while the ipv4 subnet was already
there, the up script that sets the masquerade rules was not called.

It broke connectivity for either ipv4 or ipv6 between the client and the
members in UDP listeners in multivip load balancers.

Since 2023.2, we deprecated some settings in the [neutron] section
('endpoint', 'endpoint_type' and 'ca_certificates_file'), they are
respectively replaced by 'endpoint_override', 'valid_interfaces' and
'cafile'. There's some code in Octavia that automatically sets the new
settings if the user still has the old settings (it is required because
keystoneauth uses the CONF objects to establish the sessions).
But some corner cases were not correctly addressed in that patch.

Now Octavia ensures that the override of the parameters is correctly
handled.

We want to cap a maximum mdevs we can create.
If some type has enough capacity, then other GPUs won't be used and
existing ResourceProviders would be deleted.

Since Ib74fdab7a8927ef9cc24ef7810e9cf2c264941eb, we no longer bump
neutron resources' revision numbers when no actual changes are applied.
Still, we were logging a debug message for OVN revision number bump.

This patch skips the message in this scenario.

Cinder has provided cinder_internal_teant_project/user_id to define
its internal project and user, but these are not predictable thus
users always need to set up keystone and create an internal project
and user to define these parameters.

This change introduces the new internal_tenant section in cinder.conf
which accepts keystoneauth parameters. With these parameters, users
are now allowed to define internal project and user by names and cinder
automatically looks up ids from Keystone.

Note that this change also lets cinder to ensure that its internal
project and user actually exists in Keystone to detect any mis-
configurations.

During last release cycle oslo.messaging has landed [1] series of extremely
useful changes that are designed to implement modern messaging
techniques for rabbitmq quorum queues.

Since these changes are breaking and require queues being re-created,
it makes total sense to align these with migration to quorum queues by default.

This implimentation help to test ironic scalability.

As the existing fake system driver simulate VMs this
fake_ipa simulate the IPA by:

- Running an API server with the needed real IPA endpoint.
- Send back fake inspection data when requested.
- lookup the node and save tokens.
- Heartbeating to ironic API with several threads looping over
  a queue of fake agents.
- Faking the sync/async commands needed by ironic to inspect,
  clean and provision a node.

The current code only adds the service secret to libvirt when Ceph has
been enabled in Nova, but it should also be enabled if it has only been
enabled in Cinder.

This patch changes devstack/plugin.sh to write the service secret to
libvirt whenever Nova or Cinder is using Ceph.

This would be the counterpart of the code we already have in
_undefine_virsh_secret where we are already checking if it's enabled in
either of the services to remove the secret.

In order to be able to globally enable notification reporting for all services,
without an need to have ceilometer deployed or bunch of overrides for each
service, we add `oslomsg_notify_enabled` variable that aims to control
behaviour of enabled notifications.

Presence of ceilometer is still respected by default and being referenced.

Potential usecase are various billing panels that do rely on notifications
but do not require presence of Ceilometer.

This adds another INIT container to initialize DPDK interfaces for
OVN. I prefered this in the OVN charts but really didn't want
another place for all the DPDK values that already existed in the
Neturon chart. Essentially, just copied the OVS agent init
container manifest that does this for an OVS without OVN config.

Also changed the br-phys to br-ex bridge name because that is a
default in both the OVN and neutron charts to use.
Otherwise you'd have an orphaned br-ex doing nothing in the config.

Looking at the captured log, it's obvious that we've had a short read.
I'm not sure why this is happening - perhaps resource contention or
threads stepping on each other's toes - but it causes random failures.
This is because when we parse the list we end up with a split line, e.g.

  [
    'openstack.api.compute.GET.servers.500:1.000000|ms',
    'openstack.api.compute.',
    'GET.servers.500:1|c',

instead of

  [
    'openstack.api.compute.GET.servers.500:1.000000|ms',
    'openstack.api.compute.GET.servers.500:1|c',
    'openstack.api.compute.GET.servers.attempted:1|c',
  ]

Work around the issue by concatenating to a byte string instead. This
means we'll only ever split on the newline character. It's a bit of a
hack but it'll do just fine.

Test the ability to launch an AMD Sev guest instance [1]. Create the
necessary image/flavor to launch this type of guest. Confirm
memoryBacking and  launchSecurity are present in the guest XML:

  <memory unit='KiB'>65536</memory>
  <currentMemory unit='KiB'>65536</currentMemory>
  <memoryBacking>
    <locked/>
  </memoryBacking>
...

    <cbitpos>47</cbitpos>
    <reducedPhysBits>1</reducedPhysBits>
    <policy>0x0033</policy>
  </launchSecurity>

Validate all devices with model type virtio also has iommu enabled for
the driver:

    <memballoon model='virtio'>
      <stats period='10'/>
      <alias name='balloon0'/>
      <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x04' slot='0x00' function='0x0'/>
      <driver iommu='on'/>
    </memballoon>

Lastly confirm AMD Sev is active from within the guest.

Test leveraged methods in test_vgpu so those methods were migrated to
the base class.

This patch adds an extra_spec ""encryption_enabled"" that is
automatically set and unset when creating or deleting
encryption types. It is not setable elsewhere.
Due to this new extra_spec non-Admin users can now see, whether
a volume type can create encrypted volumes or not.

During last release cycle oslo.messaging has landed [1] series of extremely
useful changes that are designed to implement modern messaging
techniques for rabbitmq quorum queues.

Since these changes are breaking and require queues being re-created,
it makes total sense to align these with migration to quorum queues by default.

After the commit
https://github.com/openstack/pbr/commit/8778c64776b092065988d92865ebaf2892930493

The module PBR in openstack started to validating the parameters when
creating an embedded WSGI, now if invalid arguments are given
to the cloudkitty-api it raises an error as we are facing in the
devstack when using `CLOUDKITTY_USE_MOD_WSGI=False`:

cloudkitty-api[86126]: usage: cloudkitty-api [-h] [--port PORT] [--host IP] -- [passed options]
cloudkitty-api[86126]: cloudkitty-api: error: unrecognized arguments: --config-file=/etc/cloudkitty/cloudkitty.conf

This PR also extracts the upgrade database workflow to a function
to be used in grenade tests

deletion of 1000 routes took >1m30s and >6m30s for 2000 routes,
with this change it takes ~5s and ~8s, respectivily.

During last release cycle oslo.messaging has landed [1] series of extremely
useful changes that are designed to implement modern messaging
techniques for rabbitmq quorum queues.

Since these changes are breaking and require queues being re-created,
it makes total sense to align these with migration to quorum queues by default.

Presence of ceilometer is still respected by default and being referenced.

Potential usecase are various billing panels that do rely on notifications

During last release cycle oslo.messaging has landed [1] series of extremely

Since these changes are breaking and require queues being re-created,
it makes total sense to align these with migration to quorum queues by default.

Currently the container replicator syncs all shards from the
shard_ranges table in both directions. We send all shard rows to the
remote and pull in all the shards the remote has to offer. This means we
can sync important shard data quicker.
The relevent part however is we sync _ALL_ shard data. We knew this
would become as issue of scale at some point. But seeing as the number
of shards is much less then objects, we thought this would be an issue a
long time in the future.

Downstream we're now seeing sharded containers will more the 10,000
shards and growing. This syncing of all shards will start to get
problematic.

This patch reuses the existing incoming and outgoing sync tables in the
container DB to also track sync (high water marks) of shards.
Instead of modifying the db to store more then 1 sync point per db id.
The db id get's a `_shards` appended when added or referenced in the
table.

Now when the replicator syncs syncs with another sharded container, it
can look up to see what ROWID it last sync upto in the shard_ranges
table and only sync new rows. If it hasn't sunk or it isn't found in the
sync table, everything will be sync.
Unlike objects, there is no limit. Because we want to sync all missing
sharding data.

This patch also changes the get_all_shard_range_data function to instead
of getting all shard ranges then converting them to dicts, it just
basically copies the get_items_since and returns dicts straight from the
DB. Which should be quicker.

This is a work in progress, just getting it off my computer for now.

Currently we register all parameters about the quota feature to
[DEFAULT] section. However it is difficult for operators to identify
that some of these parameters like reservation_expire are used in the
quota feature, based of names and descriptions of the parameters.

This change migrates all quota options to the new [quota] section,
so that operators can easily understand which parameters are used
in the quota feature.
