Clone the `neutron-lbaas-dashboard repository`_ and check out the release that corresponds to the version of Horizon that is installed: .. code-block:: console $ git clone http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/neutron-lbaas-dashboard/ $ cd neutron-lbaas-dashboard $ git checkout OPENSTACK_RELEASE #. Install the Horizon panel plugin: .. code-block:: console $ python setup.py install #. Copy the ``_1481_project_ng_loadbalancersv2_panel.py`` from the ``neutron-lbaas-dashboard/enabled`` directory into Horizon's ``openstack_dashboard/local/enabled`` directory. This step ensures that Horizon can find the plugin when it enumerates all of its available panels. #. Enable the plugin in Horizon by editing ``local_settings.py`` and setting ``enable_lb`` to ``True`` in the ``OPENSTACK_NEUTRON_NETWORK`` dictionary. #. If Horizon is configured to compress static files for better performance (usually set via ``COMPRESS_OFFLINE`` in the ``local_settings.py``), the static files must be optimized again: .. code-block:: console $ ./manage.py collectstatic $ ./manage.py compress #. Restart Apache to activate the new panel: .. code-block:: console $ sudo service apache2 restart To find the panel, click on **Project** in Horizon, then click the **Network** drop down, and click **Load Balancers**. .. _neutron-lbaas-dashboard repository: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/neutron-lbaas-dashboard/ ",,49,0

If an instance is booted from a volume, shelved, and goes into an error
state due to some reason, the volume from which instance is booted
remains even the instance is deleted because instance has no host
associated with it.

Called _local_delete() to detach volume and destroy bdm if instance is
in shelved_offloaded state or has no host associated with it. This will
cleanup both volumes and the networks.

Note:
Ankit had submitted same patch [1] earlier which was reverted [2] due
to a race condition on jenkins if an instance is deleted when it is in
building state.  The patch was then rebumitted [3] fixing the
the failure of race condition by reverting the ObjectActionError
exception handling in _delete.  This patch was later re-reverted [4]
due to continued jenkins race conditions.

The current patch avoids the jenkins race condition by leaving the flow
for instances in the BUILDING state unchanged and only calling
_local_delete() on instances in the shelved_offloaded or error states
when the instance has no host associated with it.  This addresses the
concerns of the referenced bugs.

Middleware (e.g. an encrypter) may need to modify user metadata header
values such that they violate the constraints (e.g. an encrypted value
may be longer than the plaintext value). This should be ok provided
the middleware first applies the constraints checks.

This patch modifies check_metadata to store the checked state in a
request header 'X-Backend-Metadata-Checked' and not repeat the checks
if they have already been successful.

So the code-path for sync mode and async mode\n  would co-exist for now. To achieve this with minimal/no code\n  duplication and cleaner interface, we are using openstack/futurist.\n- There are two classes of container operations - one that can be made\n  async, viz. create/delete/start/stop/pause/unpause/reboot, which do\n  not need data about the container in return. The other type requires\n  data, viz. container-logs. For async-type container-operations,\n  magnum-API uses CAST instead of CALL from oslo_messaging.\n- magnum conductor maintains a queue of async container-operations, per\n  bay per container, which is executed in sequence, preserving\n  chronological ordering by a greenthread from the pool.\n- 'create-in-progress', 'delete-in-progress' - status is reflected on\n  the container object.\n- If an operation in progress, in async-mode, do not allow 'container\n  show' to over-write the state of the container.\n- Communication with COE has to be more resilient, when multiple\n  operations are in progress.\n\nTo try out this feature, apply the patch on your devstack, enable the\nconfig, as shown in etc/magnum/magnum.conf.sample, and restart\nmagnum-api and magnum-conductor.\n\nA snippet showing the timing improvement from async mode on devstack\nhttps://gist.github.com/surojit-pathak/2cbdad5b8bf5b569e755\n\nChange-Id: I19bdb4006ca6c004876c4e04c664379be06a146c\nImplements: blueprint async-container-operations\nImplements: blueprint async-rpc-api\n""}, {'number': 13, 'created': '2016-02-02 04:42:54.000000000', 'files': [], 'web_link': 'https://opendev.org/openstack/magnum/commit/4e016e0b06a9e300b9be0f6600201c0884ff83ce', 'message': 'Magnum asynchronous container operation\n\nThe spec for this design is\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/275003/\n\nTo try out this feature, apply the patch on your devstack, enable the\nconfig, as shown in etc/magnum/magnum.conf.sample, and restart\nmagnum-api and magnum-conductor.\n\nA snippet showing the timing improvement from async mode on devstack\nhttps://gist.github.com/surojit-pathak/2cbdad5b8bf5b569e755\n\nChange-Id: I19bdb4006ca6c004876c4e04c664379be06a146c\nImplements: blueprint async-container-operations\nImplements: blueprint async-rpc-api\n'}, {'number': 14, 'created': '2016-02-08 22:04:18.000000000', 'files': [], 'web_link': 'https://opendev.org/openstack/magnum/commit/cd305c59d2d72b4a607f9e73247ecfc5802c233b', 'message': 'Magnum asynchronous container operation\n\nThe spec for this design is\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/275003/\n\nTo try out this feature, apply the patch on your devstack, enable the\nconfig, as shown in etc/magnum/magnum.conf.sample, and restart\nmagnum-api and magnum-conductor.\n\nA snippet showing the timing improvement from async mode on devstack\nhttps://gist.github.com/surojit-pathak/2cbdad5b8bf5b569e755\n\nChange-Id: I19bdb4006ca6c004876c4e04c664379be06a146c\nImplements: blueprint async-container-operations\nImplements: blueprint async-rpc-api\n'}, {'number': 15, 'created': '2016-02-18 17:58:02.000000000', 'files': [], 'web_link': 'https://opendev.org/openstack/magnum/commit/566a5ff7eae3b4a7ebae2bb872d335d702c3b524', 'message': 'Magnum asynchronous container operation\n\nThe spec for this design is\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/275003/\n\nTo try out this feature, apply the patch on your devstack, enable the\nconfig, as shown in etc/magnum/magnum.conf.sample, and restart\nmagnum-api and magnum-conductor.\n\nA snippet showing the timing improvement from async mode on devstack\nhttps://gist.github.com/surojit-pathak/2cbdad5b8bf5b569e755\n\nChange-Id: I19bdb4006ca6c004876c4e04c664379be06a146c\nImplements: blueprint async-container-operations\nImplements: blueprint async-rpc-api\n'}, {'number': 16, 'created': '2016-02-25 00:39:14.000000000', 'files': [], 'web_link': 'https://opendev.org/openstack/magnum/commit/fb2b91f94ceca1c69143e78498e642f2ecba6d50', 'message': 'Magnum asynchronous container operation\n\nThe spec for this design is\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/275003/\n\nTo try out this feature, apply the patch on your devstack, enable the\nconfig, as shown in etc/magnum/magnum.conf.sample, and restart\nmagnum-api and magnum-conductor.\n\nA snippet showing the timing improvement from async mode on devstack\nhttps://gist.github.com/surojit-pathak/2cbdad5b8bf5b569e755\n\nChange-Id: I19bdb4006ca6c004876c4e04c664379be06a146c\nImplements: blueprint async-container-operations\nImplements: blueprint async-rpc-api\n'}, {'number': 17, 'created': '2016-03-07 22:07:40.000000000', 'files': ['magnum/api/controllers/v1/container.py', 'magnum/tests/unit/conductor/handlers/test_docker_conductor.py', 'magnum/conductor/handlers/docker_conductor.py', 'magnum/conductor/api.py', 'magnum/tests/unit/conductor/test_rpcapi.py', 'magnum/conductor/config.py', 'magnum/common/rpc_service.py', 'magnum/common/docker_utils.py', 'magnum/objects/fields.py', 'magnum/tests/unit/objects/test_objects.py'], 'web_link': 'https://opendev.org/openstack/magnum/commit/6c4fc126a86d627d7c0bd7bd47c5e6f8518d9f9f', 'message': 'Magnum asynchronous container operation\n\nThe spec for this design is\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/275003/\n\nTo try out this feature, apply the patch on your devstack, enable the\nconfig, as shown in etc/magnum/magnum.conf.sample, and restart\nmagnum-api and magnum-conductor.\n\nA snippet showing the timing improvement from async mode on devstack\nhttps://gist.github.com/surojit-pathak/2cbdad5b8bf5b569e755\n\nChange-Id: I19bdb4006ca6c004876c4e04c664379be06a146c\nImplements: blueprint async-container-operations\nImplements: blueprint async-rpc-api\n'}]",24,267134,6c4fc126a86d627d7c0bd7bd47c5e6f8518d9f9f,63,10,17,15311,,,0,"Magnum asynchronous container operation

Problem Statement =================== OpenStack networking project (neutron [1]) have a extension plugin implemented and which expose api for quality of service that can be also be implemented by any backend networking service provider to support qos. These APIs provide a way to integrate OpenStack Neutron QOS with any of the backend QOS providers. OpenDay light provides a QOS service for bandwidth and dscp marking but a driver is needed to integrate that api provided by openstack neutron with service in ODL Proposed Change =============== Implementation of this spec will introduce a neutron QOS driver for OpenDaylight Controller in networking-odl project that will pass through the neutron QOS API's call to the OpenDaylight Controller. Detailed Design =============== To enable the formal end to end integration between OpenStack QOS and OpenDaylight requires an QOS driver for OpenDaylight. ODL QOS driver will act as a shim layer between OpenStack and OpenDaylight that will carry out following two main tasks: * Translation of OpenStack neutron QOS API to ODL QOS classifier yang models** * Translation of OpenStack neutron QOS API's to OpenDaylight Neutron Northbound QOS models** ** This work is not yet completely done, The OpenDaylight neutron northbound project yang model is under review for QOS. These models will be based on the existing neutron qos plugin APIs. This work is out of scope of networking-odl work and will be collaborated in the scope of the OpenDaylight Neutron Northbound project. QOS providers in OpenDaylight can listen to these OpenDaylight Neutron Northbound QOS models and translate it to their specific yang models for classification/qos. The following diagram shows the high level integration between OpenStack and the OpenDaylight QOS provider:: +---------------------------------------------+ | OpenStack Network Server (neutron qos) | | +-------------------+ | | | networking-odl | | | | QOS Driver | | | +-------------------+ | +----------------------|----------------------+ | REST Communication | ----------------------- OpenDaylight Controller | | +-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------+ | +----------v----+ +---v---+ | | Neutron | QOS Classifier| |QOS | Neutron | | Northbound | Models | |Models | Northbound| | Project +---------------+ +-------+ Project | | / \ | | | / \ | | | / \ | | | +-----V---+ +----V----+ +---V---+ | | | QOS | | QOS | | provider| ... | provider| | QOS | ... | +---------+ +---------+ +-------+ | +-----------|----------------|------------------|---------------+ | | | | | | +-----------V----------------V------------------V---------------+ | Network/OVS | | | +---------------------------------------------------------------+ In the above architecture, the opendaylight components are shown just to understand the overall architecture, but it's out of scope of this spec's work items. This spec will only track progress related to networking-odl OpenStack QOS driver work. Dependencies ============ It has a dependency on OpenDaylight Neutron Northbound QOS classifier and chain yang models, but that is out of scope of this spec.

From newton cycle, networking-odl project will adopt spec process
in light weight manner to track its tasks and tech details.
This isn't intended to replace Neutron Stadium Evolution[1], but
to complement it to address networking-odl project specific stuff.
Specs are not for users/operators, but for developers. So it's
better to store those files for specs separated. If it's user facing
feature or public API, it should go to neutron spec process.

The full fledged process similar to core neutron wouldn't be
worthwhile because networking-odl is much smaller. And specs for
networking-odl will be stored in networking-odl repo for now as small
start. This might be revised later.
This patch creates doc/specs directory and moves related specs files
under it.

Adapt ""nova resize"" code to support Virtuozzo ploop disks.
As far as ploop disks are in fact directories we add '-r' argument
to all utilities that deal with instance' disks such as cp, rsync and scp.
Thus we copy disks universally whether they are folders or files.

Also using ""prl_disk_tool"" instead of ""qemu-img"" is better for ploop images
because it resizes guest filesystem as well.

We can't resize disks from guest OS in containers,
because they are not allowed to write directly to block device.
ploop tool can resize partition table and internal filesystem,
but only for container's disks. Such disks must have only one partition
with ext filesystem.

prl_disk_tool can resize disks with internal filesystems
and doesn't require any special layout so it can resize disks
for virtual machines.  So it's better to use this tool instead of ploop.

Also we make compute.filters more strict
We call ""ploop"" only with ""restore-descriptor"" argument
And we set disk size in megabytes for prl_disk_tool

Problem description =================== At present there is only one format we can define for both IPv4 and IPv6 ips. If a user want to have different naming convention for records created through Sink service we dont have a way to do that since there is only one option in designate.conf where we defing the FQDN format. Proposed change =============== In designate.conf we should give an option under the Sink configuration where we can define two different formats for IPv4 and IPv6. Similarly in we need to make appropriate changes in sink code under designate/notification_handler/ for base.py, nova.py and neutron.py SINK Changes ------------ Base.py, nova.py and neutron.py needs to be changed to get the format type from designate.conf. The new formats that we need to get are formatv4 and formatv6 which will now be implemented in designate.conf. API Changes ----------- None Central Changes --------------- None Storage Changes --------------- None Other Changes ------------- None Alternatives ------------ This is an optional section, where it does apply we'd just like a demonstration that some thought has been put into why the proposed approach is the best one.

During the upgrade playbook, rabbitmq is restarted. The deploy
node will try to contact rabbitmq directly, based on its
inventory hostname. If the inventory hostname is unknown to the
deployment node, the playbook will fail.

The rabbitmq playbook now delegates the rabbitmq check to the
physical host having the rabbitmq node, on the IP used for
SSH'ing, instead of the hostname.

keystone init currently only runs on create. This causes issues
and ends up with broken deploys on re-runs or upgrades. This
change ensures we expose a new force option so user can manually
run post config deploy and get back missing endpoints. Also modify
keystone init to check all services instead of just nova before
triggering keystone endpoint create.

I understand this is moving to puppet, but so long as this is here
lets make sure it works for upgrades and reruns.

An `Audit`_ is an optimization request. There are two types of audits: * ONESHOT : the audit will only be executed once * CONTINUOUS : the audit will be executed regularly with a given frequency. We propose to use the `APScheduler`_ library to schedule the continuous audits. Note: This library is already in the Openstack global requirements. `APScheduler`_ provides several scheduler implementation to schedule jobs with a specific interval. The scheduler which seem to match well our requirements is the BackgroundScheduler. APScheduler provides an example for using the BackgroundScheduler. .. https://github.com/agronholm/apscheduler/blob/master/examples/schedulers/background.py The DecisionEngineManager (watcher/decision_engine/manager.py) class will need to be amended in order to instantiate the new ContinuousAuditManager class. The ContinuousAuditManager class will contain the BackgroundScheduler but also the logic for managing the continuous audits. We should also create a ContinuousAuditJob class in charge of supervising one audit. In the ""ContinuousAuditManager"" class will be able to add a new job Continuous `Audit`_ to the job list. We can easily add new audits or remove old ones on the fly with BackgroundScheduler. So, the existing continuous audit jobs should be automatically added by the decision_engine during start. Then, the ContinuousAuditManager will manage the audit jobs in even driven fashion. In order to do that, we should then modify the 'post', 'patch' and 'delete' methods in the watcher/api/controllers/v1/audit.py file for sending notification messages. The ContinuousAuditManager will subscribe to theses events in order to CUD (create,update,delete) the Audits. APScheduler give also the possibility to store your jobs in a database. In this way, the jobs will survive decision engine restarts and maintain their state. This feature is interesting but for the first implementation of the continuous audit we will use the memory backend. Jean-Emile DARTOIS <jed56>.. _APScheduler: https://github.com/agronholm/apscheduler","To perform audits with continuous type we can use periodic_task decorator from oslo_service module on 'launch_audits_periodically' method. This method gets continuous type audits with (PENDING, ONGOING) states. If some of them are not in audits_to_launch list we add them to that list and to the ThreadPoolExecutor. Once audit is added to thread, this thread is going to sleep for PERIOD seconds. After this audit will be executed and UUID of audit will be removed from audits_to_launch list.",45,8

The nova-api-metadata service which runs in the neutron-gateway
charm units will shutdown if it does not receive a response from
a nova-conductor within a short timeout period; this can happen
if the nova-conductor is not yet wired to the messaging bus.

Trigger a remote restart using the existing relation api when

In order to support security and critical bug fixes in official projects, they all need to provide series-based stable branches. If a library has no stable branch for a series, then in order to fix issues in the library for that series we must allow new versions from the master branch to be used in the stable branch. Sometimes that works fine, but in cases where the new release from master requires new minimum versions of second-tier dependencies, we cannot safely introduce the new version into the stable branch. It is better to use the cycle-with-intermediary model, even if a project does not aggressively backport changes to the stable branches created.",,16,0

It is best if we disable stonith if a cluster has it configured and on,
before we call ""pcs cluster stop --all"", because should a service fail
to stop for whatever reason, pacemaker will fence the node where it
happened. This is something that we unlikely want during an upgrade as
it will make things worse.

Once the cluster is stopped we can reenable stonith (if it was enabled
to start with) in the CIB while the cluster is shut down.

Existing implementation of Neutron-based networking assumed that the
neutron's security groups are used to manage VM accessibility.
However there may exist environments with disabled security-group
extension in Neutron and thus relying on something else to restrict
the traffic. Murano could not operate in such environments since it
always was attempting to create resources of type
OS::Neutron::SecurityGroup and attach VMs' ports to this resource.

This is addressed by introducing a new subclass of
SecurityGroupManager - DummySecurityGroupManager, which actually does
nothing but silently ignores the calls to create security rules. This
new security manager is instantiated instead of
NeutronSecurityGroupManager for Neutron-based networks in cases if the
'security-group' extension is not present in Neutron's configuration.
If it is instantiated a warning message is reported to the end-user to
notify them that security requirements of the application were
ignored.

The agent has no easy way of figuring out the MTU of the network
on which the VIP is configured, so we hardcode it as 1430, which
will avoid connection errors on deployments using VXLAN encapsulation.

The real fix would be to make vif_driver.plug() pull the MTU from the
network information instead of expecting it as a separate parameter.

Other projects are adviced to adopt similar practices. .. note:: Tools mentioned in the guidelines below are currently maintained in `openstack-infra/release-tools repository`_. Most of them are implemented as Unix filters that can be interconnected into a pipeline to accommodate for specific project needs and practices. .. note:: Guidelines below assume that there is a group of people behind the effort that are willing to help. Tips on how to build the subteam are out of scope for the document. From high level perspective, proactive backporting process consists of the following steps: #. identify bugs fixed since the previous triage event; #. of those, pick only those bugs that does not break stable policy policies; #. distribute identified backport candidates among subteam members; #. subteam members consider each candidate bug for inclusion into *stable* and *oldstable* branches; if applicable, backports are proposed for review and tracked until inclusion into appropriate branches; #. new stable releases are created in due time. This is ongoing process, and it's usually executed on weekly basis, or with other frequency that fits better the subteam and the project in question. Now, let's cover each step with more details. Identify new bug fixes ---------------------- The process assumes that the subteam keeps track of the last git hash that was validated somewhere. For the initial candidate list generation, it's adviced to start on a branch boundary (the latest common git commit between *stable* and *master* branches). For every new git commit found in *master* branch, commit message is checked for bug tags (Closes-Bug, Partial-Bug, Related-Bug, ...) All bugs mentioned are considered for initial filtering. For this exact need, use the following release tool: .. code-block:: bash $ ./bugs-fixed-since.py --repo ../neutron --start 1ce8ce9546479c0ce6055c0c205a8885699e3051 1514424 1560464 1546110 ... Filter out features and enhancements ------------------------------------ Due to stable policy described above, new features and enhancements are generally not allowed in stable branches. For example, to filter out bugs that have importance set to Wishlist in Launchpad, you can use the following tool: .. code-block:: bash $ ./bugs-fixed-since.py [...] | lp-filter-bugs-by-importance.py neutron --importance Wishlist 1514424 1560464 1546110 ... The resulting list is expected to contain only actual bug fixes. In case you also want to filter out bugs of Low importance, append another call to the tool: .. code-block:: bash $ [...] | lp-filter-bugs-by-importance.py neutron --importance Low 1514424 1560464 1546110 ... Once you are satisfied with the query result, you should remember the latest commit checked, and also store the bug list somewhere. To achieve the latter, multiple directions can be taken. #. One way is to store it in some external tool like Etherpad. If this direction is chosen, the following tool may become handy to make the list more consumable: .. code-block:: bash $ [...] | ./annotate-lp-bugs.py neutron https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1514424 ""neutron metadata ns proxy does not support ssl"" (Medium,Fix Released) [in-stable-mitaka,l3-ipam-dhcp] [vuntz] https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1560464 ""ovsdb monitor doesn't return ofport"" (High,Fix Released) [in-stable-liberty,in-stable-mitaka] [kevinbenton] https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1546110 ""DB error causes router rescheduling loop to fail"" (Medium,Fix Released) [in-stable-kilo,in-stable-liberty,in-stable-mitaka,l3-ipam-dhcp,liberty-backport-potential] [brian-haley] ... #. Another alternative is to tag backport candidates in Launchpad. For that, it's adviced to avoid using *$release-backport-potential* tags, and instead introduce a new tag per project team (f.e. *neutron-proactive-backport* for Neutron). This is to avoid conflicts in the tag usage by multiple teams running independent backporting processes when bug fixes spanning multiple projects are considered. .. code-block:: bash $ [...] | ./lp-tag.py neutron-proactive-backport-potential This command will tag all identified backport candidates with the project specific tag. For example, check the `neutron proactive-backport-potential dashboard`_. With that, you get access to all filtering features available in Launchpad. Distribute the work ------------------- Once you have a list of candidate bug fixes to consider for backporting, it's time to distribute it among subteam members. Depending on which method is chosen above to track candidate bug fixes, you may utilize Launchpad search queries, or other filtering technique to identify bugs of specific topics of interest, to distribute the work to folks who are experts in those topics. .. note:: Exact search queries and filters are project specific and largely depend on existing bug tracking practices adopted by projects. Hence they are out of scope for the document. Candidate triage ---------------- Each candidate bug should be assessed on its applicability to *stable* and *oldstable* branches, as per corresponding support phase definitions. For example, for *stable* branch, all bug fixes of user value can be considered to backport; while for *oldstable* branch, only critical bugs are allowed to be backported. For every applicable stable branch, a backport is proposed in Gerrit. The backporter is expected to follow the progress of the backport to make sure it's not lost in reviews. Once all applicable backports are proposed to Gerrit and are on their path towards stable inclusion, *<project>-proactive-backport* tag can be removed from the bug. Release often ------------- Proactive backporting process is expected to trigger higher volume of changes in stable branches. To make releases more granular, it's adviced participating projects create new stable releases often. It may be done on a bi-weekly basis, or any other schedule that fits better the project and its actual backports volume. .. _openstack-infra/release-tools repository: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/release-tools/ .. _neutron proactive-backport-potential dashboard: https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bugs?field.searchtext=&orderby=-importance&search=Search&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&field.status%3Alist=TRIAGED&field.status%3Alist=INPROGRESS&field.status%3Alist=FIXCOMMITTED&field.status%3Alist=FIXRELEASED&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&assignee_option=any&field.assignee=&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=&field.structural_subscriber=&field.tag=neutron-proactive-backport-potential&field.tags_combinator=ANY&field.has_cve.used=&field.omit_dupes.used=&field.omit_dupes=on&field.affects_me.used=&field.has_patch.used=&field.has_branches.used=&field.has_branches=on&field.has_no_branches.used=&field.has_no_branches=on&field.has_blueprints.used=&field.has_blueprints=on&field.has_no_blueprints.used=&field.has_no_blueprints=on",,168,0

ovsdb has a keepalive mechanism to track state of connection. It sends
every N seconds echo request from server to client and waits for echo reply.
If reply is not obtained in N seconds, the connection is closed. By
default, the N is set to 5.

ovs python library handles this echo requests on client in different
greenlet which can cause a disconnection if this greenlet doesn't get
processed in 5 seconds.

This commit disables inactivity probe for ovsdb native connections and
lets tcp connection to handle disconnects.

When destroying a VM, we attempt to terminate the jobs affecting it.

We just loop through the jobs and try to kill them, but by the
time we do this, the jobs can disappear, in which case we'll get a
""Not Found"" exception.

In this case, it is safe to catch this exception and ignore it.

After looping through the jobs, we'll just fetch again the jobs
affecting the element, raising an exception only if there still
are pending jobs.

Also, if a job is killed, the check_ret_val method now raises an
exception instead of wrongfully reporting it as successfully
completed.

On target infra nodes there are old tox version, so we need to
lower it in library to get an ability to test yaql.
At the same time we need to make workaround of nailgun installation
due to old pip and tox versions on CI.

There are some unit tests for drivers that test internal.parse_driver_info
methods, but they only check if the information is returned using assertIsNotNone
instead of the actual value of the information.

Update those tests to check the expected value using assertEqual.

NFV features (DPDK, SR-IOV, NUMA/CPU pinning, HugePages)
can't be checked for old clusters, due to old nailgun-agent.
Old nailgun-agent doesn't send NFV specific information.
So all NFV related checks and functional should be disabled for old

osc-lib is a package of common support modules for writing

osc-lib.

So use osc-lib instead of openstackclient.

cinder.objects.volume.Volume.finish_volume_migration()
should skip the volume_type_id field when swapping fields
between ""source"" and ""dest"" volumes.  The ""dest"" volume
has already been created with appropriate volume_type_id
and the ""source"" may have not have a volume type.

This commit also changes a LOG.error() to a LOG.exception()
in where finish_volume_migration is called in order to
show the exception traceback in its calling context.

This adds PRECOMMIT callback events to the basic router DB
operations (create/update/delete). These are leveraged by the
dependent patch for flavor and provider processing.

This also adds a small context manager to the callback manager
to make it simple to reraise the original first exception raised
during the callback processing to avoid littering the exception
unpacking logic around every 'notify' call.

pandas.Timestamp is not great from performance pov and when called
enough times (possibly thousands), the overhead becomes quite
noticeable.

we should just use to_datetime to build all our timestamps and avoid
strange tuple/zip/dict combination.

this is about 10x faster regardless of size

Adds support for neutron floating IPs. I have intentionally not added
them as a child plugin to Network since typically there will only be one
external network that can support floating IPs, and so while all
floating IPs must be allocated on a network the relationship isn't
really a hierarchical one (in the same way as we don't map servers as
children of hypervisors). Floating IPs have no admin-only fields either,
so this plugin's about as simple as they get.

Note that currently this is affected by
https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1593793 (no notification on
floating IP state change).

If a cooldown period is specified in both an autoscaling group
and in a scaling policy, the stack does not autoscale.

This change fixes the cooldown logic to handle this case by
checking whether or not the scaling was triggered by a signal.

Some parameters are relevant to the infrastructure of the bay, while others are for the particular COE. In a typical workflow, a user would create a baymodel, then create one or more bays using the baymodel. A cloud provider can also define a number of baymodels and provide them to the users. A baymodel cannot be updated or deleted if a bay using this baymodel still exists. The definition and usage of the parameters of a baymodel are as follows. They are loosely grouped as: mandatory, infrastructure, COE specific. --coe \<coe\> Specify the Container Orchestration Engine to use. Supported COE's include 'kubernetes', 'swarm', 'mesos'. If your environment has additional bay drivers installed, refer to the bay driver documentation for the new COE names. This is a mandatory parameter and there is no default value. --image-id \<image-id\> The name or UUID of the base image in Glance to boot the servers for the bay. The image must have the attribute 'os-distro' defined as appropriate for the bay driver. For the currently supported images, the os-distro names are: +------------+-----------------------+ | COE | os-distro | +============+=======================+ | kubernetes | fedora-atomic, coreos | | swarm | fedora-atomic | | mesos | ubuntu | +------------+-----------------------+ This is a mandatory parameter and there is no default value. --keypair-id \<keypair-id\> The name or UUID of the SSH keypair to configure in the bay servers for ssh access. You will need the key to be able to ssh to the servers in the bay. The login name is specific to the bay driver. This is a mandatory parameter and there is no default value. --external-network-id \<external-network-id\> The name or network ID of a Neutron network to provide connectivity to the external internet for the bay. This network must have a route to external internet. The servers in the bay will be connected to a private network and Magnum will create a router between this private network and the external network. This will allow the servers to download images, access discovery service, etc, and the containers to install packages, etc. In the opposite direction, floating IP's will be allocated from the external network to provide access from the external internet to servers and the container services hosted in the bay. This is a mandatory parameter and there is no default value. --name \<name\> Name of the baymodel to create. The name does not have to be unique. If multiple baymodels have the same name, you will need to use the UUID to select the baymodel when creating a bay or updating, deleting a baymodel. The default name is 'None'. --public Access to a baymodel is normally limited to the owner. Setting this flag makes the baymodel public and accessible by other users. The default is not public. --server-type \<server-type\> The servers in the bay can be VM or baremetal. This parameter selects the type of server to create for the bay. The default is 'vm' and currently this is the only supported server type. --fixed-network \<fixed-network\> The name or network ID of a Neutron network where the servers of the bay will be connected. Typically this would be a private network to isolate the bay from other servers/containers. If not specified, Magnum will create a new private network for this purpose. --network-driver \<network-driver\> The name of a network driver for providing the networks for the containers. Note that this is different and separate from the Neutron network for the bay. The operation and networking model are specific to the particular driver; refer to the `Networking`_ section for more details. Supported network drivers and the default driver are: +------------+-----------------+---------+ | COE | network-driver | default | +============+=================+=========+ | kubernetes | flannel | flannel | | swarm | docker, flannel | docker | | mesos | docker | docker | +------------+-----------------+---------+ --volume-driver \<volume-driver\> The name of a volume driver for managing the persistent storage for the containers. The functionality supported are specific to the driver. Supported volume drivers and the default driver are: +------------+-----------------+-----------+ | COE | volume-driver | default | +============+=================+===========+ | kubernetes | cinder | no driver | | swarm | rexray | no driver | | mesos | rexray | no driver | +------------+-----------------+-----------+ --dns-nameserver \<dns-nameserver\> The DNS nameserver for the servers and containers in the bay to use. This is configured in the private Neutron network for the bay. The default is '8.8.8.8'. --flavor-id \<flavor-id\> The nova flavor id for booting the node servers. The default is 'm1.small'. --master-flavor-id \<master-flavor-id\> The nova flavor id for booting the master or manager servers. The default is 'm1.small'. --http-proxy \<http-proxy\> The IP address for a proxy to use when direct http access from the servers to sites on the external internet is blocked. This may happen in certain countries or enterprises, and the proxy allows the servers and containers to access these sites. The format is a URL including a port number. The default is 'None'. --https-proxy \<https-proxy\> The IP address for a proxy to use when direct https access from the servers to sites on the external internet is blocked. This may happen in certain countries or enterprises, and the proxy allows the servers and containers to access these sites. The format is a URL including a port number. The default is 'None'. --no-proxy \<no-proxy\> When a proxy server is used, some sites should not go through the proxy and should be accessed normally. In this case, you can specify these sites as a comma separated list of IP's. The default is 'None'. --docker-volume-size \<docker-volume-size\> The size in GB for the local storage on each server for the Docker daemon to cache the images and host the containers. Cinder volumes provide the storage. The default is 25 GB. --docker-storage-driver \<docker-storage-driver\> The name of a driver to manage the storage for the images and the container's writable layer. The supported drivers are 'devicemapper' and 'overlay'. The default is 'devicemapper'. --labels \<KEY1=VALUE1,KEY2=VALUE2;KEY3=VALUE3...\> Arbitrary labels in the form of key=value pairs. The accepted keys and valid values are defined in the bay drivers. They are used as a way to pass additional parameters that are specific to a bay driver. Refer to the subsection on labels for a list of the supported key/value pairs and their usage. --tls-disabled Transport Layer Security (TLS) is normally enabled to secure the bay. In some cases, users may want to disable TLS in the bay, for instance during development or to troubleshoot certain problems. Specifying this parameter will disable TLS so that users can access the COE endpoints without a certificate. The default is TLS enabled. --registry-enabled Docker images by default are pulled from the public Docker registry, but in some cases, users may want to use a private registry. This option provides an alternative registry based on the Registry V2: Magnum will create a local registry in the bay backed by swift to host the images. Refer to `Docker Registry 2.0 <https://github.com/docker/distribution>`_ for more details. The default is to use the public registry. Labels ------",,173,0

Changing it to call ipam driver each time subnet update is requested.
If subnet_update is called without allocation_pools, then old allocation
pools are passed to ipam driver.

Contains a bit of refactoring to make that happen:

- reworked update_db_subnet workflow;

previous workflow was:
call driver allocation -> make local allocation -> rollback driver
allocation in except block if local allocation failed.

By changing order of execution we eliminating need of rollback in this
method, since failure in local allocation is rolled back by database
transaction rollback.

COMMIT 2:
Check if pool update is needed in reference driver

Commit 6ed8f45fdf529bacae32b074844aa1320b005b51 had some negative impact
on concurrent ip allocations. To make ipam driver aware of subnet
updates (mostly for thirdparty drivers) ipam driver is always called
with allocation pools even if pools are not changed.

Current way of handling that event is deleting old pools and creating
new pools. But on scale it may cause issues, because of this:
- deleting allocation pools removes availability ranges by foreign key;
- any ip allocation modifies availability range;
These events concurently modify availability range records causing
deadlocks.

This fix prevents deleting and recreating pools and availability ranges
in cases where allocation pools are not changed. So it eliminates
negative impact on concurency added by always calling ipam driver on
subnet update.
This fix aims to provide backportable solution to be used with
6ed8f45fdf529bacae32b074844aa1320b005b51.

Complete solution that eliminates concurrent modifications in
availability range table is expected to be devivered with
ticket #1543094, but it will not be backportable because of the scope of
the change.

When fixing backup using temp snapshot code path, the call to
_init_volume_driver was missed:
    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/321943/

For drivers that rely on do_setup to initialize the driver, this
is a problem because the driver cannot be used without this call.

This patch fixes the problem by calling _init_volume_driver in
init_host.

If we run two resize tests one by one with the same
instance for two resize operations than we have a bug.
First test case test_resize_server_from_manual_to_auto
resizes the instance from flavor_ref to flavor_ref_alt.
After that we reuse this instance for the next test case
test_resize_server_from_auto_to_manual. In this test case
we try to resize this instance from flavor_ref_alt to flavor_ref.
And it causes error ""Can't resize disk down"".
In this patch we use a new server for each test case.
Firstly we create a new instance, than we set necessary
disk_config and try to resize this instance. Also we added
server_id as parameter for _update_server_with_disk_config()
to set disk_config for specified instance.

Adding support for iSCSI multipath in huawei cinder driver. If enable
iSCSI multipath, when attaching volume, cinder driver will get all
useable eth ports from target storage, and return them to nova. The
params like DefaultTargetIP and TargetPortGroup in configure file will
not take effect. If iSCSI multipath is not enabled, cinder driver will
use the info like DefaultTargetIP or TargetPortGroup in config file to
get corresponding ports from target storage.

Periodically the migration code needs to configure an
updated downtime with the QEMU guest. Move the code for
doing this out into its own method to make it possible
to test it directly. This changes the way we check the
downtime - instead of incrementally popping entries
off the downtime_steps list, we leave the list intact
and simply keep track of the current downtime value.
This avoids having side-effects on the parameters passed
into the downtime update method.

Remove CONF dependencies from the client manager base class,
to make it useful to external consumers (such as plugins).

The ultimate target is to have a manager which can be used with
as little as possible setup, which only instantiates the clients
which are actually needed by the test, and which allows to register
new service clients defined in plugins.

Since plugins already import both manager.Manager and
clients.Manager, we maintain for now both classes with their names.
The plan is to migrate the 6 core service client groups to
manager.Manager, so that those clients are available to all tests
along with plugin clients. That requires a few steps. I'm doing
changes in clients.Manager for now so that it's easier to review.

The result of this first step is:
- manager.Manager is moved to manager_lib.Manager and does not
  depend on CONF anymore, nor on any tempest unstable class.
  It does not provide any client yet.
  Add unit test coverage for this class.
- manager.Manager is still provided with backward compatible
  interface for plugins benefit.

This change reads in the variable set ""overcloud_deployment_result"" and
determines whether or not to exit the playbook based on the variable result
vs. exiting the playbook immediately after a deployment fails.

This allows us to run inventory on the overcloud nodes, and collect logs
for further debug.  I expect this to transform into it's own role so we
can make adjustments to the level of debugging for a deployment.

Add thread level concurrency to container sync

This change introduces a new config option 'threads' to the
container sync daemon. With threads > 1 the work of syncing a
certain container is distributed amongst several (green) threads.
We use a green thread pool of size 'threads', where each thread is assigned
a different row from the container db.

Changes in sync.py:
The container_sync method was modified to accommodate multi threading.
With the introduction of multiple threads we have quickly ran into
a bottleneck trying to read row by row from the db, and so an additional
change is to read rows in bulks. For this we introduce iterators over the
db that yield rows to sync.

Changes in test_sync.py:
Tests were updated to test
(1) The modified structure of container_sync (test_phase_2, test_phase_1).
(2) The newly introduced iterators

Changes in doc:
saio container-server config files were updated to have threads > 1.
This allows to test the sync daemon with parallelism while leaving
the 1 default so as not to impact the run time behavior in existing
deployments.

container-server-sample.conf was added with the threads option.

The default installation option of OpenStack services since the Liberty release has been to use virtual environments to isolate each individual service. This should be the only supported option going forward. Proposed change =============== Each role will be updated to remove tasks and variables related to allowing the option of installing pip packages outside of a virtual environment. The tasks which currently handle installing virtual environments will also be updated to ensure that they are idempotent and can recover properly from an interruption in a previous run of the same role. Alternatives ------------ Leave the roles as they are. Deployment of OpenStack services would continue being supported through either virtual environments or installed as global system Python packages. Playbook/Role impact -------------------- See `Proposed change`_. Upgrade impact -------------- Installing services to virtual environments has been the default since the Liberty release. If any Mitaka deployments are still configured to not install services to virtual environments, they will be forced to beginning in the Newton release. Security impact --------------- N/A. Performance impact ------------------ Tasks which are currently being skipped will be removed, which could slightly decrease role run times. End user impact --------------- N/A. Deployer impact --------------- The *_venv_enabled variables will no longer exist and will have no effect if set by a deployer. Developer impact ---------------- N/A. Dependencies ------------ N/A. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: https://launchpad.net/~jimmy-mccrory (jmccrory) Work items ---------- * Remove tasks related to installation of pip packages outside of a venv from each role * Remove variables which currently toggle installation of pip packages to a venv from each role * Update each role to make tasks which create and install packages to a venv more resilient and idempotent Testing ======= Both integrated and independent role gate testing are already only installing services to virtual environments.

Operators would like the flexibility to limit specific databases to specific volume types similar to the way in which databases can be limited to specific Nova flavors. Launchpad Blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/trove/+spec/associate-volume-type-datastore Problem Description =================== Operators can create different volume types and a user can specify a volume type on a create instance request. Operators would like the ability to limit the volume types that can be used for a specific datastore-version in the same way that they can limit Nova flavors. Proposed Change =============== The implentation that associated flavors with datastores [1][2] created a generic framework that provided for the specification of datastore-version-metadata. This metadata was stored into a table in the database called datastore_version_metadata. .. code-block:: sql CREATE TABLE `datastore_version_metadata` ( `id` varchar(36) NOT NULL, `datastore_version_id` varchar(36) DEFAULT NULL, `key` varchar(128) NOT NULL, `value` varchar(128) DEFAULT NULL, `created` datetime NOT NULL, `deleted` tinyint(1) NOT NULL, `deleted_at` datetime DEFAULT NULL, `updated_at` datetime DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`), UNIQUE KEY `UQ_datastore_version_metadata_datastore_version_id_key_value` ( `datastore_version_id`,`key`,`value`), CONSTRAINT `datastore_version_metadata_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`datastore_version_id`) REFERENCES `datastore_versions` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE) CREATE TABLE `datastore_versions` ( `id` varchar(36) NOT NULL, `datastore_id` varchar(36) DEFAULT NULL, `name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL, `image_id` varchar(36) NOT NULL, `packages` varchar(511) DEFAULT NULL, `active` tinyint(1) NOT NULL, `manager` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`), UNIQUE KEY `ds_versions` (`datastore_id`,`name`), CONSTRAINT `datastore_versions_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`datastore_id`) REFERENCES `datastores` (`id`)) CREATE TABLE `datastores` ( `id` varchar(36) NOT NULL, `name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL, `default_version_id` varchar(36) DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`), UNIQUE KEY `name` (`name`)) The code populates flavor to datastore-version mappings by using a key of 'flavor' in the table datastore_version_metadata. We propose to extend this capability by using a key of 'volume-type' in the same table. We extend the trove-manage command and provide two new commands to add and delete a volume-type mapping. In addition it is proposed that two new commands be added to list existing associations. These list commands will exploit an existing method (list datastore version flavor associations). Changes will be made to add a new mapping, see the section below on Public API for details. The endpoint will provide a list of all volume types allowed for a given tenant_id, datastore, and datastore version. Suitable error messages will be provided by adding new exception classes. One error will be for a missing mapping between a given datastore-version and a volume-type, and the other will be for a situation where a mapping already exists. The datastore version metadata model (trove/datastore/models.py) has code for handling the existing flavor mappings. This code will be refactored to extend the metadata mappings to also support volume type. The service class that will be referenced in the WSGI endpoint will be added. As we will be extending the existing metadata capability, no new database tables will be required. During instance creation, a check will be added for the volme type being specified. If the volume type provided is not found to be a valid volume type for the specified datastore version, an error will be reported. Currently volume type support does not extend to the cluster create API. Since this change will return volume type information, service, model and view for VolumeType and VolumeTypes will be added. If no datastore/version/volume-type has been configured then all volume-types known to cinder are allowed. A python-troveclient command to list datastore/version/volume-type associations will be provided. It will call the new public API and show the results. A trove-manage command to list datastore/version/volume-type associations will be provided. It will list only the associations in the database and not intersect with valid cinder volume-types. The trove-manage command performs no validations, it does not check with cinder whether a volume-type being specified is actually a volume-type known to cinder or not. And the volume-type, once defined in trove could be deleted by cinder at a later time. It is therefore possible that the volume type association in the trove metadata table could become stale. Therefore, the implementation relies on the concept of defined mappings and allowed mappings. A defined mapping is something specified by the user in the metadata table. An allowed mapping is the intersection of the defined mapping and valid cinder volume types. If a datastore does not support volumes, all of the checking described in this specification is moot. When the user has defined mappings for a particular datastore and version, (and volume support is enabled), we look to see whether any allowed mappings exist. If not, a distinct error message is generated indicating that no valid volume types could be found. If there are defined volume types, we ensure that volume type is specified and is one of the allowed volume types. New APIs will also be added to list all volume types available in cinder and also to show the details of a specified volume type. Tests will be added to exercise the new code paths. Issues ------ 1. In the present flavor implementation (that is used as the template for this volume_type) implementation, there is a discrepancy between the values returned by the list_datastore_version_flavor_associations (datastore/models.py) method, and the flavors that will be accepted in the check found in the create() call. This has been addressed in the code for volume type by instead calling the datastore/models method to list valid volume type associations. 2. The volume type was never stored with the instance and therefore when you show an instance, you can't tell what volume_type was specified on create. 3. volume_type is not required in the create call. If an association is present for datastore/version/volume_type and no volume_type is specified for the create, then the cinder default is used. The option would be to make the volume_type required which would be a change to the API. As implemented, if a volume_type is specified in create, it must be in the list of allowed volume types. Guessing the volume type is the alternative, and if more than one is allowed, a default would have to be provided. This has not been implemented. Configuration ------------- None Database -------- No database changes will be required. Public API ---------- This change will add the following Public APIs: List all volume types ..................... This API will return all volume types as reported by cinder. Request:: GET /{tenant_id}/volume-types Response:: { ""volume_types"": [ { ""is_public"": true, ""description"": ""Example volume type"", ""id"": <id>, ""name"": ""example_volume_type"" } ] } Show volume type details ........................ This API will return the specified volume type's details as reported by cinder. Request:: GET /{tenant_id}/volume-types/{id} Response:: { ""volume_type"": { ""is_public"": true, ""description"": null, ""id"": ""53c71e3d-ef8f-4967-8b16-8a0ee6380d66"", ""name"": ""lvmdriver-1"" } } List allowed datastore version volume types ........................................... This API will return all supported volume-types for the given combination of tenant_id, datastore, and datastore vesion. If no association has been configured then all volume types known to cinder are returned. Request:: GET /{tenant_id}/datastores/{datastore}/versions/{version_id}/volume-types Response:: { ""volume_types"": [ { ""is_public"": true, ""description"": ""Example volume type"", ""id"": <id>, ""name"": ""example_volume_type"" } ] } Public API Security ------------------- There are no API security issues associated with this change. Python API ---------- No changes. CLI (python-troveclient) ------------------------ The trove-manage command will be the only affected as described above. Internal API ------------ None. Guest Agent ----------- None Alternatives ------------ One alternative that was considered was to associate datastores with supported volume types (not datastore-versions). This would have resulted in almost completely reimplementing the metadata linking scheme that was created for flavors. Dashboard Impact (UX) ===================== The create dialog volume type dropdown will be filtered to show only valid values based on the selected datastore version. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: mvandijk Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: N-Release-1 Work Items ---------- As described above in detail in the ""Proposed Change"" section. Upgrade Implications ==================== There are no upgrade implications. We aren't adding or changing the structure of any existing tables. The existing code can't create mappings that could conflict with this proposed feature (all existing code creates mappings with a key of 'flavor'). Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= New tests will be added. Documentation Impact ==================== Yes, documentation of the mechanism to add, delete and list mappings will be provided. References ========== ..

This patch fixed the code by dividing the collection interval to the value_diff.

time_diff is calculated by currenttime - cache_time from the cache file.

cursors for several components. Adding href attributes to link tags in
AngularJS will cause unwanted route changes. This styling fix ensures
the correct cursor styling is applied to link tags without the need

tasks requested against the VM, such as pausing it. This
task processing is handled by a separate inline method.
Move this inline method out to be a static method in
the class, and add explicit testing of it. This also
adds an explicit warning if it finds an unknown task.

This patch allows attaching and detaching volumes in HA Active-Active
configurations.

To allow the attach and detach of volumes in Cinder using the cluster
topic queue in the Message Broker following RPC methods in
cinder/volume/rpcapi has been changed:

- attach_volume
- detach_volume
- initialize_connection
- terminate_connection
- remove_export

When the cluster field is not set for a volume all RPC calls will behave
as before, sending it to the host topic queue.

Console auth tokens are being saved in the database instead
of in memory in the console auth server. With cells V2 this
will be the child cell database. Console URLs currently only
include a token, which is not enough for the console proxy to
find the cell that has the token and connection information
if it is deployed at the api level. So we add the instance
uuid to the URL query string (as a parameter called 'server')
to allow it to find the correct cell.

This change is compatible with the existing console proxies
so it is safe to do it first. Later patches will add code
to the proxies to retrieve console auth tokens from the
database.

Cell healing has been updated to work by sending instance objects
up to the global cell.  The global cell then computes the changes to
sync based on the instance object's changed fields.  However, since the
instance object was freshly loaded from the DB, this list of changes is
always empty.

This patch fixes it by manually marking the fields in the instance
object as changed.

This patch removes the ``:orphan:`` docinfo from the documentation
and instead adds the orphaned docs into the ``exclude_pattern``
configuration option. There's a bug that causes the tag to actually
get rendered in the docs when those docs are brought in via an
include.

This patch removes the ``:orphan:`` docinfo from the documentation
and instead adds the orphaned docs into the ``exclude_pattern``
configuration option. There's a bug that causes the tag to actually
get rendered in the docs when those docs are brought in via an
include.

This commit adds the transport_url parameters for oslo.messaging. The
url is of the form:

  transport://user:pass@host1:port[,hostN:portN]/virtual_host

Where the transport scheme specifies the rpc or notification backend
as one of rabbit, amqp, zmq, etc. Oslo.messaging is deprecating the
host, port, and auth configuration options [1]. All drivers will get
these options via the transport_url.

This patch:
* use oslo::messaging::default resource
* use oslo::messaging::notifications resource
* add parameters for transport_url(s)
* correct config file for amqp backend
* update spec tests
* add feature release note

Breaking down the aggregation into two stages.

The first stage aggregates raw metrics frequently and is
implemented as a Spark Streaming job which
aggregates metrics at a configurable time interval
(defaults to 10 minutes) and writes the intermediate
aggregated data, or instance usage data
to new ""metrics_pre_hourly"" kafka topic.

The second stage is implemented
as a batch job using Spark Streaming createRDD
direct stream batch API, which is triggered by the
first stage only when first stage runs at the
top of the hour.

Also enhanced kafka offsets table to keep track
of offsets from two stages along with streaming
batch time, last time version row got updated
and revision number. By default it should keep
last 10 revisions to the offsets for each
application.

This module had pre-existing content which is not the
methodology puppet-openstack community advises.

This commit takes the content from their new-module
documentation and commits it to this repo as a marker
to where the module should have started.

The previous history is being kept for preservation
and will be migrated into upcoming commits to establish
a developmental history based on the cookiecutter and
msync foundation as documented by the puppet openstack
community.

Currently to deploy Ceph, operators are expected to apply a GPT
partition label to the disk they wish to be provisioned, and an Ansible
library script called 'find_disks.py' makes use of udev to locate the
disk based on this label.

This has two issues,

1) udev does not support the detection of GPT labels on older (but still
LTS) distros (see
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=681809). This was also
confirmed by Sam Yaple who did the majority of the implementation on
find_disks.py

2) Some operators may not wish to use GPT

This patch provides a new variable called ""ceph_disks"", which allows
operators to provide a comma separated list of disks to be provisioned
on each node. This retains the properties of the existing provisioning,
but skips the use of find_disks.py.
