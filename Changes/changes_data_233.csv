Some deployments just don't use root device hints, and this is okay.

However, other deployments need root device hints, and with fast
track mode in ramdisks, we created a situation where the node cache
could be updated by a human or software between the time the agent
was started, and the deployment was requested.

As a result, the agent has been updated to check if we have a hint

Or at least try to.

Some deployments just don't use root device hints, and this is okay.

However, other deployments need root device hints, and with fast
track mode in ramdisks, we created a situation where the node cache
could be updated by a human or software between the time the agent
was started, and the deployment was requested.

As a result, the agent has been updated to check if we have a hint
and if we don't, update the cache from the node lookup endpoint.

This is not needed when the inband deploy steps are executed, as
the process of updating the steps does force the node cache to be
updated.

This patch is a follow up patch of the main change[1] that adds
support for share server migration in NetApp driver.
It fixes two issues:
- Data motion 'get_backend_configuration' now avoids sending vserver
  configuration, available only in DHSS=False mode, when driver is
  configured with DHSS=True.
- After migrating a share server, all volumes appears with different
  autosize configuration and need to be manually updated to the
  original values. Provisioning options are also being updated in the
  same method.

This change introduces an extend attached encrypted volume test
specifically using the LUKSv1 encryption format after issues were
discovered in bug #1861071. The test mostly reuses the existing test for
extending attached unencrypted volumes with some specific encryption
related logic being introduced in BaseVolumeAdminTest.

Note that while attached volume extension is not an admin only operation
the creation of the encrypted volume type is, resulting in this test
being labelled as an admin test.

A ``[compute-feature-enabled]/extend_attached_encrypted_volume``
configurable is also introduced to control when this test is ran.

Operators who encounter this situation should use the ``ipmi_cipher_suite`` parameter in the ``driver_info`` field to override and directly assert the required cipher.

Facts gathering comes next after clearing the cached ones. Facts
will be gathered if --tags facts was specified. But cached facts get
cleared always, even w/o that tag.

In DCN deployments that may bring errors that can be avoided with
ansible-playbook-command.sh --tags facts. That is because fact caching
needs to be updated when running outside of the overcloud.

Fix this inconsistency so that the facts never cleared nor gathered
until the facts tag has been used explicitly.

The ceph backup driver uses ceph's internal snapshot mechanism for doing
incremental backups. This type of incremental backup is more an
implementation detail than something that should be exposed to the
outside, because it makes handling of the backups harder.

By forcing backups to incremental, if an earlier backup exists, you can
only clean up old backups by deleting all backups, effectively giving up
the safety of backups, and restarting all over again.

The exported and imported diff results in a fully usable rbd image,
which effectively resembles base backup semantics, in the target cluster
and ceph has no problem deleting snapshots that are in the middle of the
snapshots history. By forcing all ceph backups to be full backups in
cinder, we can leverage this to enable easier backup management.

First attempt at a naive implementation for Peer Persistence volumes in the
HPE 3PAR driver for Cinder.

This is a cleaned-up version of a patch we are currently using on a
standalone Cinder installation (non-OpenStack). This means that the basic
functionality of being able to create cinder volumes with peer persistence
has been validated. However, a multitude of tests will be required in order
to merge this functionality upstream.

A first attempt at listing the tests to be executed:

- Validation of the ""replication:peer_persistence"" setting
- Double-check implementation/configuration of peerpersistent volumes
- Validate creation of peerpersistent volumes when one 3PAR instance is
  unavailable
- Validate automatic fail-over of an existing peerpersistent volume when
  a 3PAR instance goes offline
- Validate manual fail-over of a peerpersistent volumes
- Evaluate retype functionality for peerpersistent volumes

If 'volume_types' for expected_attrs is being used, volume_types
returned is actually mapped to the GroupVolumeTypeMapping
model rather than the VolumeTypes model. This corresponds
to the following staticmethod Group._from_db_object in cinder/objects/group.py:

  if 'volume_types' in expected_attrs:
      volume_types = base.obj_make_list(

This change ensures that the 'volume_types' member of Group object is
correctly mapped to VolumeTypes. We implemented it using primaryjoin
and secondaryjoin arguments of sqlalchemy.orm.relationship to define
a column in Group model.

If the image has been updated on disk, the podman_container isn't
rebuild to use the new container.  This change adds an image id check to
the image check to see if the image name and tag are the same but the id
of the image has changed. It should be noted that the podman_container
does not fetch the updated image as it simply checks if it exists. A

It also cleans out some secondary requirements that are no longer needed
due to our direct dependencies being updated.

Linters are removed that are kept in the global requirements blacklist
as those are not version tracked and are not relevant for our
lower-constraints unit test runs.

If a custom CA file is configured via OPENSTACK_SSL_CACERT, currently
communication with Keystone will fail, since the session is not created
using this CA file.

This change fixes the issue by passing the path to the CA file to the

As a courtesy for project teams, on RC1 week the release management
team proposes a RC1 release for all cycle-with-rc deliverables,
based on HEAD. That RC1 will double as the branch point for the

Release liaison or PTL should +1 this proposal if they are happy
with it, amend this proposal (for example with a more recent SHA)
to match their needs, or -1 to block it until release-critical

When SwiftRawDisks is set, try to mount the disks using uuids instead of
paths. This makes mounts more stable, eg. if a kernel gets updates and
device orders are changed.

This patch will also update existing entries in /etc/fstab and replaces
the device path with the corresponding UUID.

When upgrading the Undercloud in the FFU procedure a sequential
upgrade is carried out. If using rhos-release, the 'latest'
build is used by default, which is not what we want.

This patch extends the ffu_undercloud_repo_args to include the
appropriate default parameters needed for rhos-release and sets
them for the role execution.

This is queens-only due to this whole mechanism being different in
later branches.

Since GroupVars moved to overcloud.j2.yaml in
https://review.opendev.org/677218 the CIDR set in
'{{network.name_lower}}_cidr' in groupvars is limited
to one of the subnets on the network.

When a network have multiple subnets with different
subnet prefixes, this becomes a problem as nodes are
configured with the from subnet mask.

This change moves them to AnsibleHostVars.

Occasionally, there would be notifications which will remain 'new',
'error' or 'running' status all times, and not to be processed again.
Due to this, operator can not update the segment or host.

This patch add one task to periodically check unfinished notifications.
If one unfinished notification is expired, just set its status to

The IPA images we presently build/use for centos are
now smaller than their peak size a few months ago.

As such, we should be able to reduce that memory footprint
and still execcute all of the necessary tests without any
issues.

Also increases the amount of swap to 8GB as the infra
default is now 1GB.

As a courtesy for project teams, on RC1 week the release management
team proposes a RC1 release for all cycle-with-rc deliverables,
based on HEAD. That RC1 will double as the branch point for the

Release liaison or PTL should +1 this proposal if they are happy

Since GroupVars moved to overcloud.j2.yaml in
https://review.opendev.org/677218 the CIDR set in
'{{network.name_lower}}_cidr' in groupvars is limited
to one of the subnets on the network.

When a network have multiple subnets with different
subnet prefixes, this becomes a problem as nodes are
configured with the from subnet mask.

This change moves them to AnsibleHostVars.

Introduced changes:
- pre-commit config and rules.
- Add pre-commit to pep8 gate, Flake8 is covered in the pre-commit hooks.
- Applying fixes for pre-commit compliance in all code.

Also commit hash will be used instead of version tags in pre-commit to
prevend arbitrary code from running in developer's machines.

pre-commit will be used to:
- trailing whitespace;
- Replaces or checks mixed line ending (mixed-line-ending);
- Forbid files which have a UTF-8 byte-order marker
  (check-byte-order-marker);
- Checks that non-binary executables have a proper
  shebang (check-executables-have-shebangs);
- Check for files that contain merge conflict strings
  (check-merge-conflict);
- Check for debugger imports and py37+ breakpoint()
  calls in python source (debug-statements);
- Attempts to load all yaml files to verify syntax (check-yaml);
- Run flake8 checks (flake8) (local)

Introduced changes:
- pre-commit config and rules
- Add pre-commit to pep8 gate, Flake8 is covered in the pre-commit hooks.
- Applying fixes for pre-commit compliance in all code.

Also commit hash will be used instead of version tags in pre-commit to
prevend arbitrary code from running in developer's machines.

pre-commit will be used to:
- trailing whitespace;
- Replaces or checks mixed line ending (mixed-line-ending);
- Forbid files which have a UTF-8 byte-order marker (check-byte-order-marker);
- Checks that non-binary executables have a proper
  shebang (check-executables-have-shebangs);
- Check for files that contain merge conflict strings (check-merge-conflict);
- Check for debugger imports and py37+ breakpoint()
  calls in python source (debug-statements);
- Attempts to load all yaml files to verify syntax (check-yaml);
- Run flake8 checks (flake8) (local)

This adds support to use jinja template for network config.
Also adds ones to be used with default undercloud and
standalone.

Though the templates of both undercloud and standalone are
almost the same, separate ones are kept as before.

If someone wants to override the whole config as supported
earlier it can be done by choosing a different template.

As a courtesy for project teams, on RC1 week the release management
team proposes a RC1 release for all cycle-with-rc deliverables,
based on HEAD. That RC1 will double as the branch point for the

Release liaison or PTL should +1 this proposal if they are happy

This change fixes the NetApp promote back issue when using CIFS
protocol. When promoting a replica, the NetApp ONTAP driver
attempts to create a new CIFS share entity (an access point as
defined in [1]) for the new active replica. This behavior
causes a failure since the storage identifies that a current
backend CIFS share with the same name exists, considering
that the reffered replica was once the active one.

This issue is addressed by removing the related CIFS share
entity when the replica gets promoted.

Introduced changes:
- pre-commit config and rules
- Add pre-commit to pep8 gate, Flake8 is covered in the pre-commit hooks.
- Applying fixes for pre-commit compliance in all code.

Also commit hash will be used instead of version tags in pre-commit to
prevend arbitrary code from running in developer's machines.

pre-commit will be used to:
- trailing whitespace;
- Replaces or checks mixed line ending (mixed-line-ending);
- Forbid files which have a UTF-8 byte-order marker (check-byte-order-marker);
- Checks that non-binary executables have a proper
  shebang (check-executables-have-shebangs);
- Check for files that contain merge conflict strings (check-merge-conflict);
- Check for debugger imports and py37+ breakpoint()
  calls in python source (debug-statements);
- Attempts to load all yaml files to verify syntax (check-yaml);
- Run flake8 checks (flake8) (local)

Introduced changes:
- pre-commit config and rules
- Add pre-commit to pep8 gate, Flake8 is covered in the pre-commit hooks.
- Applying fixes for pre-commit compliance in all code.

Also commit hash will be used instead of version tags in pre-commit to
prevend arbitrary code from running in developer's machines.

pre-commit will be used to:
- trailing whitespace;
- Replaces or checks mixed line ending (mixed-line-ending);
- Forbid files which have a UTF-8 byte-order marker (check-byte-order-marker);
- Checks that non-binary executables have a proper
  shebang (check-executables-have-shebangs);
- Check for files that contain merge conflict strings (check-merge-conflict);
- Check for debugger imports and py37+ breakpoint()
  calls in python source (debug-statements);
- Attempts to load all yaml files to verify syntax (check-yaml);
- Run flake8 checks (flake8) (local)

Infra's disk/swap availability has been apparently
reduced with the new focal node sets such that we

If we configure more swap, then naturally that means

And as such, we should be able to complete grenade

In an amphora failover situation, if the VRRP port of the other
amphora in an active/standby pair is missing from neutron, the amphora
failover may fail with a ""port not found"" error.
This patch corrects this issue by allowing the amphora failover in

This change just gives the allocations to the target node when the revert_resize
is done by adding the allocations to the finish_revert_migration() interface.

Since we changed I018762335b19c98045ad42147080203092b51c27 to no longer using
allocations for revert_resize, we don't need this change for the series but
as we already said to the out-of-tree virt driver maintainers that we would
modify the finish_revert_resize method(), maybe we should still merge this ?

This test was created due to a bug [1] that was found when
creating a share type with non allowed share type.
When creating a share using a private share from other tenant, i.e.
the tenant has no access to the share type. As expected it failed
with 404, but the share stuck on ""creating"" status.

Note: This issue happens only when the share type name is used
for creating the share.
Creating a share using share type id works as expected.

There was a race in the late server group policy check because we
were updating instance.host after _validate_instance_group_policy and
without locking.

This change ensures that we account both for servers which are already
on the host and servers which are building by keeping a list of
builders.

Note that with this change we now deliberately do the late validation
check before taking a claim in both the build and rebuild/evacuate
cases. This is now safe in the build case: because we're doing
'in-progress' accounting in the check itself it is no longer necessary
that instance.host be set first. By flipping the order we prevent a
situation where multiple builds take a claim, then all of them fail the
validation check, leaving none of the building. With this change we will
always allow the maximum permitted number of builds to proceed.

1) Allow the container build tools to run config-less

This change allows the container build tools to run without a
provided configuration file. The container configuration file
still in service was derived from our old kolla implementation
which no longer needs to exist. The build process will now
simply walk the build path and build all containers found when
a configuration file is not defined or present. Logging has
been added to inform the user of the tools discoveries which
should provide a nice user experience when running container
builds.

In the event a container configuration file is used, the tools
will now ensure all dependent images are inherently part of the
build preparation.

Tests have been updated to ensure that the client is operational
in both a config and config-less situation.

(cherry picked from commit 4d23eee41e86cd52c3d6c62e86e10daec582213e)

2) Update dependency logic to correctly index parents

This change adjusts the parent indexer so that it will correctly
discover base images that maybe be implicitly required.

Signed-off-by: Kevin Carter <kecarter@redhat.com>
(cherry picked from commit f081d6afd630aabcf9e827d77a4b2f4a82097f81)

These changes improve the TCIB user experience and ensure we're future
proofing our container build tools.

be created pointing at the correct certificates. This
change updates the HA handlers to ensure that the

The driver inflated total and available capacity
due to an incorrect calculation. The driver was
also ignoring the configuration option
""reserved_share_percentage"" that allows
deployers to set aside space from scheduling
to prevent oversubscription.

While this bugfix may have an upgrade impact,
some things must be clarified:
- Inflating the total, free space will allow
  manila to schedule workloads that may run
  out of space - this may cause end user
  downtime and frustration, because shares are
  created (empty subvolumes on ceph occupy no
  space) easily, but they could get throttled
  as they start to fill up.
- CephFS shares are always thinly provisioned
  but, the driver does not support oversubscription
  via manila. So, real free space is what
  determines capacity based scheduler decisions.
  Users however expect share sizes to be honored,
  and manila will allow provisioning as long
  as there is free space on the cluster. This
  means that Ceph cluster administrators
  must manage oversubscription outside of manila
  to prevent misbehavior.

If you stand up a docker-distribution registry, basic auth can be
configured with tls to lock down the registry. Currently the only auth
method that is supported is the bearer tokens used by the public
registries.  This change checks the www-authentication header to see if
we should try basic auth or the bearer token auth.

NOTE: Rocky is missing a few backports so this patch is rocky specific.

If you reuse a container tag for a new image, paunch does not currently
rebuild the container to get the new image.  This change adds logic to
the updated check to also check the image id defined in the container
instance against the image id for the image to see if the container

Rather than use the shell tasks to determine if we have rsyslog, we can
use ansible's systemd module. Additionally, we should only run this bit
of code once if proxy and storage are being installed on the same node.
Currently it'll run the same bit of code twice.

To have correct support in rootwrap, ""ping""/""ping6"" command should
have the correct filters in rootwrap.

Because ""ping"" command is harmless, ""CommandFilter"" is used to allow
any binary call, regardless of the parameters used and the order.

Nevertheless, this patch also proposes to use ""ping""/""ping6"" with
the same parameters and a specific order, to help in the debug
process:
- ping[6] -W <timeout> <address>
- ping[6] -W <timeout> -c <count> <address>
- ping[6] -W <timeout> -c <count> -i <interval> <address>

Those commands could be called from inside a namespace. The needed

This is documented under [Ceph iSCSI][cdg-ceph-iscsi] in the [OpenStack Charms Deployment Guide][cdg].[cg-preview-charms]: https://docs.openstack.org/charm-guide/latest/openstack-charms.html#tech-preview-charms-beta [cdg-ceph-iscsi]: https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/charm-deployment-guide/latest/app-ceph-iscsi.html,"Ceph can be used to back iSCSI targets for VMWare initiators. Begin by accessing the VMWare admin web UI. These instructions were written using VMWare ESXi 6.7.0. ### Create a Ceph pool If desired, create a Ceph pool to back the VMWare targets with the ceph-mon charm's `create-pool` action: juju run-action --wait ceph-mon/0 create-pool name=vmware-iscsi ### Enable the initiator From the web UI select the `Adapters` tab in the `Storage` context. Click `Configure iSCSI` and enable iSCSI. Take a note of the initiator name, or UID. Here the UID we'll use is `iqn.1998-01.com.vmware:node-gadomski-6a5e962a`. ### Create an iSCSI target With the `create-target` action create a target for VMWare to use. Use the pool that may have been created previously: juju run-action --wait ceph-iscsi/0 create-target \ client-initiatorname=iqn.1998-01.com.vmware:node-gadomski-6a5e962a \ client-username=vmwareclient \ client-password=12to16characters \ image-size=5G \ image-name=disk-1 \ pool-name=vmware-iscsi > **Note**: VMWare imposes a policy on credentials. The username should be more than eight characters and the password between twelve and sixteen characters. ### Add a target to VMWare Follow the [Ceph iSCSI gateway for VMWare][ceph-iscsi-vmware-upstream] documentation to use the new target. Use the (CHAP) username and password passed to the `create-target` action. When finished, under the `Devices` tab you should see the created target. To make more devices available to VMWare simply create more targets (use a different image name and optionally a different image size). You will need to `Rescan` and `Refresh` for the new devices to appear. > **Note**: At the time of writing, the redundant task of setting the credentials via the ESX CLI is still a necessity. This will require you to enable SSH under `Manage` > `Services` > `TSM-SSH` > `Actions` (Start). <!----> [cg-preview-charms]: https://docs.openstack.org/charm-guide/latest/openstack-charms.html#tech-preview-charms-beta[ceph-iscsi-vmware-upstream]: https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rbd/iscsi-initiator-esx/",7,57

As a courtesy for project teams, on RC1 week the release management
team proposes a RC1 release for all cycle-with-rc deliverables,
based on HEAD. That RC1 will double as the branch point for the

Release liaison or PTL should +1 this proposal if they are happy
with it, amend this proposal (for example with a more recent SHA)
to match their needs, or -1 to block it until release-critical
issues are all fixed.

When creating additional subnets with ipv6 auto-addressing
ip allocation was added to existing ports without filtering
on current allocation's segment.

This adds fitering to only add auto-address allocation when
the new subnet is on the same segment as the ports current
ipam allocations.

This patch implements an Ansible interface to os-net-config.

* os_net_config module; which is in charge of running os-net-config
  tool. It supports a few options now (from os-net-config CLI):

  - cleanup, to cleanup unconfigured interfaces
  - config_file, to specify the os-net-config configuration file
  - debug, to enable debug level logging
  - detailed_exit_codes, to exit os-net-config with code 2 if files were
    modified. Note: the module will still return rc 0 if no error
    otherwise Ansible pukes.
  - safe_defaults, which will try to apply safe defaults if the provided
    configuration failed to execute. It'll basically run dhcp on all
    discovered interfaces.

  The module returns ""rc"" as the return code.
  The module has molecule testing, and we re-use the same script to
  generate safe defaults for os-net-config.

* update tripleo_network_config role; in charge of TripleO Network
  configuration.

  - Adding tripleo_network_config_legacy_script parameter, true by
    default so the legacy shell script is run.
  - Adding tripleo_network_config_safe_defaults since some network
    configs don't need default safe defaults.
  - Updating main, to run the newly created os_net_config module if
    tripleo_network_config_legacy_script is False.
  - New playbook, os_net_config.yml, running os-net-config with the
    provided config.

Useing get_attr, pulling index 0 in the segments list
of a network to associate the a subnet with the ""first""
segment is useful since the ""first"" segment is created
by neutron behind the scenes on network create. A resource
reference cannot be used since the ""first"" segment is'nt
a heat resource.

The issue is the order of the segments list is'nt reliable.

On stack update index 0 may be a different segment, and
we end up trying to update the segment_id for a subnet.
Changeing the segment association is not allowed, so
the stack update fails.

While not perfect, sorting the list so that segments where
name is None comes first will ensure that index 0 can be used.

The template author should ensure segments defined in the heat
template all have a names set, so that only the segment creted
implicitly by neutron have 'None' name.

Stack updates changeing attributes of the network can cause the list of segments to shift. The ordering is now slightly more predictable, segments with name=``null`` will not be placed first in the list. This does'nt guarantee the order, but ypically only the segment implicitly created by neutron has no name attribute set. By ensuring other segments on the network does have a name set, the implicit segment will always be index 0. Resolving it's attributes via get_attr on the network resource will this be predictable.
