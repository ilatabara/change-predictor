Now the gate test of ceilometer is broken, because the ceilometer test
is using nonstable tempest interfaces and these interfaces are changed.
QA team defines interfaces which are not under tempest.lib as unstable
clearly according to

https://github.com/openstack/tempest/blob/master/doc/source/library.rst#stability

So current test way is against the QA policy, so here is a workaround.
Copy&paste is not good, almost wrong. However, if still continuing the
tests, it would be a nice option to copy&paste and pass the gate test.
After QA team defines stable interfaces, that is a nice time to switch
using the stable interfaces with removing this copy&paste code.

Closes-Bug: #1589426

Depends-On: I3abd9049560ee507b3610ab482c697a239f13a3b
(cherry picked from commit 6c0b97b1e6fc03bdf84bf9b888761bd22ea0ad58)

+

When running gabbi under testr, concurrency grouping is controlled
by a regex in .testr.conf. A module name change in gabbi 1.22.0
inadvertently broke the grouping. This change should work for
old and new versions.

Since the build and upload jobs for the deb-openstack-pkg-tools repo
are slightly special and not currently intended to be reused exactly
for other packaging repos, it's easier for now to hard-code the
project name and make the upload publisher specific to the upload
job using it. These can be broken back out into reusable/composable
macros if the jobs get turned into job-templates later, but for now
there's only one repo anyway.

Also stop retaining the source directory hierarchy and just treat
the destination as a flat arrangement of files instead.

always been meant to be optionally deployed, and like
the other deliverables, they should be described

The SDK implements Python bindings to the OpenStack API, which enables you to perform automation tasks in Python by making calls on Python objects, rather than making REST calls directly. New users should default to coding against the OpenStack SDK. shade ----- `shade <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/shade>`_ is a an abstraction library focused on hiding implementation differences between OpenStack clouds. While the OpenStack SDK presents a clean object interface to the underlying REST APIs, shade hides them if doing so is advantageous. If you plan on running the same python program against many OpenStack clouds, you may want to use shade - but if you need to access any features of a cloud that do not have an cloud-neutral abstraction mapping, you will be unable to do so with shade. Per-project client libraries ---------------------------- Each OpenStack project produces a client library that wraps its own REST API. Unless there is no other choice for some reason, the per-project libraries should be avoided. Direct REST calls via keystoneauth ---------------------------------- All of OpenStack's APIs are actually REST APIs. The `keystoneauth <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystoneauth>`_ library provides an object that looks very much like a `Session <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#request-sessions>`_ object from the Python `requests <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests>`_ library that handles all of the authentication for you. If you are more comfortable just dealing with REST, or if there is a feature implemented in your cloud that has not seen support in any of the libraries yet, this option is for you. .. toctree:: :maxdepth: 2 sdk_install.rst sdk_authenticate.rst sdk_manage_images.rst sdk_assign_cors_headers.rst sdk_schedule_objects_for_deletion.rst sdk_configure_access_security_instances.rst sdk_neutron_apis.rst sdk_compute_apis.rst ",,74,62

When we try to stop openstack-core-clone pacemaker resource, Nova
services still want to be started by Pacemaker, and crm_resource --wait
never returns.

`crm_resource --wait -VVV` keeps printing:

   notice: LogActions:   Start openstack-nova-scheduler:0      (overcloud-controller-0)
   notice: LogActions:   Start openstack-cinder-volume (overcloud-controller-0 - blocked)

   notice: LogActions:   Start openstack-nova-conductor:0      (overcloud-controller-0)

This shouldn't happen as the whole Nova resource sub-chain depends on
openstack-core:

[root@overcloud-controller-0 ~]# pcs constraint show | grep nova
  start openstack-core-clone then start openstack-nova-consoleauth-clone (kind:Mandatory)

  openstack-nova-scheduler-clone with openstack-nova-api-clone (score:INFINITY)
  openstack-nova-conductor-clone with openstack-nova-scheduler-clone (score:INFINITY)

Explicitly disabling and enabling the Nova resource sub-chain helps as a
workaround.

Currently notifications from Zaqar are very consise and simply represent
messages. Example:
{'body': 'somemessage', 'ttl': 60}

But subscribers are likely to want queue information inside
notifications, if they subscribe to multiple queues.

The only option for subscribers to know from which queue each
notification was sent is to listen on many ports, and make each port
correspond to each particular queue, but it's very inconvenient.

This patch adds queue name to each notification to make notifications
look like this:
{'body': 'somemessage', 'ttl': 60, 'queue_name': 'somequeue'}

Since we only add a new key to JSON dictionary, this patch is backward
compatible.

This patch adds new test case ""test_proper_notification_data"".
It also modifies ""test_mailto"" and ""test_webhook"" test cases, so they
consider undeterministic behavior of ""json.dumps"" function, which
often serializes dictionaries in different order, making test assertions
sometimes fail.

This allows the script to work even if the metatag are not present in
the git tag. It will then send a simple email announcing the release,

between the PREVIOUS_VERSION and VERSION.

This will allow independent projects to be managed by this script

This change introduces new return code (201 instead of 200) for
POST /v1/rules endpoint on success rule creation.

API less 1.6 continues returning 200.

Default API version was changed from minimum to maximum
which Inspector can support.

The role of the mentors is to ask questions to orient the conversations among the teams. For example, during the first sprint it is common that the CEO and the PTL will face incompatibility of their plans. Mentors should ask the teams how to address those issues. encourage one group to call for a meeting off the sprint cycle to sort the problem out.","and individual free agents.fit their streets together (use the metaphor of an API for this) to complete the session. Give each person a nametag to wear, with their first name and their role written on it. For free agents, don't disclose who is distracted, controversial, or agreeable. The community will need to work this out on their own.a direction, and the team are on board. For upstream, have them think about the community standards they want to set. Free agent contributors can get straight to work during this phase. Suggestions: simply will not accept.making suggestions, without actually doing any of the work or giving answers.encourage one group to call a midcycle to sort the problem out.",39,14

At present the ironic API explicitly sets the new state for
nodes to the beginning step in the ironic workflow.

As part of hardware fleet lifecycle management, an operator
expects to be able to migrate inventory and control systems
for their hardware fleet utilizing their existing inventory
data and allocation records. Ultimately this means that
an imported host MAY already be allocated and unavailable
for immediate allocation.

As such, a mechanism is required to permit users to put nodes
into an ACTIVE state without performing a deployment operation.

This adds a new API provision_state verb to allow users to move
nodes from MANAGEABLE state to ACTIVE state.

As per [1], this patch adds a new hacking check that verifies
raised exceptions don't use unlocalized string messages. This
patch also adds unit tests for the new check and enables
checks for neutron-lib itself (as per tox.ini).

Note: Perhaps this check better belongs in openstack-dev/hacking
but it seems we already have a number of more generic checks
in neutron. We can discuss that here need be.

NB: Without [1] this new hacking check fails when running pep8 on

3 hacking rules have been migrated from neutron. The rules are:

 [N531] Validate that LOG messages, except debug ones,
        have translations
 [N532] Validate that LOG.warning is used instead of LOG.warn.
        The latter is deprecated.
 [N533] Validate that debug level logs are not translated

We need this to ensure that all projects using the neutron-lib
hacking rules still have enforcement of the log translation
policies of the project.

    Set some useful default values with the new launch wizard.

    In Mitaka, the new launch instance wizard regresses functionality
    from the old launch wizard with regards to defaults. If there is
    only one neutron network, it is not automatically selected, if
    there is only one keypair, its not selected, and the default
    security group is not automatically selected.

    This patch fixes all of that.

The argument ""data"" is used for passing it as raw data to Glance API,
that is different from the other arguments.
This patch separates the argument on the definition and adds some

Having the debian folder containing the packaging within the upstream
sources is a very bad idea, which everyone in Debian is trying to
discourage. This creates conflicts at many levels, plus the packaging
source should be kept and maintained in a single place (and in this
case, that would be Alioth, aka git.debian.org).

Since python-monascaclient has been uploaded to Debian (and therefore,
Ubuntu will sync from it), there's no need to carry the debian folder
here. So this patch removes it.

Note that I have just uploaded version 1.0.30+dfsg1-2 to Debian. The
""+dfsg1"" part shows I had to re-create an orig.tar.xz without the
debian folder.

1. What is the problem?
In the Tricircle, the cross pod L2 networking automation is
established after the VM is plugged into. The simplest way to
stretch one L2 network across multiple OpenStack instances is to
use a same VLAN network, but there is a lot of limitation: the
number of VLAN segment is limited, the VLAN network itself is not
good to spread across multiple sites, although you can use some
gateways to do so. But there are so many tenants in the cloud, and
new tenants could be added into the cloud dynamically, fixed physical
network configuration for dynamic tenant networking is hard to manage.

2. What is the solution to the problem?
To deal with the above problem, flexible tenant level L2 networking
automation across multiple OpenStack instances in one site or in
multiple sites is needed in the Tricirlce.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle to
realize the solution?
To implement the features that networking automation supports more
than one bottom pod in AZ or multiple AZs for different use cases
in the Tricircle

The scenarios of cross-pod L2 networking can be divided into three types, ``shared VLAN``, ``shared VxLan`` and ``mixed VLAN/VxLan``.for shared VLAN type ,network in each bottom OpenStack is VLAN type and has the same VLAN ID.For shared VxLAN type,network in each bottom OpenStack is VxLAN type and has the same VxLan ID.For mixed VLAN/VxLAN type,network in each bottom OpenStack may have different types or have different segmentation ID. To achieve cross-pod L2 networking,L2GW will be used to connect L2 network in differnt pods.No extra route is required to connect L2 network.ALL L3 traffic will be forwarded to the local L2 network,then go to the server in another pod via the L2GW. Use Cases ========= **Use case for shared VLAN:** A user create network Net1,plugin check the configuration,if ``tenant_network_type`` equals shared_vlan,it will invoke shared vlan dirver. Shared VLAN driver will allocate ``segment``,and assgin ``network_type`` with vlan,and update network with ``segment`` and ``network_type`` to DB. A user create VM1 in AZ1,and connect to network Net1.If vm will be booted in POD1,tricircle will send create network message to POD1.Create network message includes ``network_type`` and ``segment``. Then user create VM2 in AZ2,and connect to network Net1.If vm will be booted in POD2,``tricircle``(``Nova-APIGW`` need to get the network info)will send create network message to POD2.Create network message includes ``network_type`` and ``segment``. **Use case for different VLAN:** A user create network Net1,plugin check the configuration,if ``tenant_network_type`` equals multi_vlan,it will invoke multi vlan driver. Multi vlan dirver need to do nothing(if segment is allocated in bottom). A user create VM1 in AZ1,and connect to the network Net1,the VM is booted in bottom POD1,and ``Nova-APIGW`` create network in POD1,then ``Nova-APIGW`` query the network detail information(using admin role),and get network type,segment id,the ``Nova-APIGW`` update the segment infomation to ``Neutron``,call ``neutron`` update network with the new segment information. Then the user create another VM2,and with az info AZ2,then the VM should be booted in bottom pod2 which is located in AZ2,And when VM2 should be booted in AZ2,``Nova-APIGW`` also create a network in pod2,and query the network information including segment and network type,update this new segment to the network in ``Neutron``. Proposed change =============== Difference between L2 networking for tenant's VM and for L3 bridging network: * A special bridge network is create and connect the routers in different bottom OpenStack.We configure the extra routes of the routers to route the packets from one OpenStack to another.In current implementation,we create this special bridge network in each bottom OpenStack with the same ``VLAN ID``,so we have a L2 network to connect the routers. * The creation of bridge network is triggered when attaching router interface and adding router external gateway. * The L2 network for VM is triggered by ``Nova-APIGW`` when a VM is to be created in one pod, and find that there is no network there, then the network will be created before the VM is booted, for VM booting needs parameter network or port. * The IP/Mac for VM is allocated in the ``Tricircle``, top layer to avoid IP/mac collision if allocate them seperately in bottom pods. Pluggable L2 networking framework: * Because ``tricircle`` top do not use ``ml2`` mechanism, so we can use it for L2 networking accross openstack. We need to implement different type driver. * Frist, config ``tenant_network_types = shared_vlan`` for ex, ``vlan_range=1-3000``. * Second, when tenant create network, ``Tricircle plugin`` invoke the corresponding type driver, like ``Shared_vlan_Driver``. And driver allocates segment and assign ``network_type`` with vlan, update the info to DB. * When create vm, if top needs to send create network to bottom, it send message inclueds ``network_type = vlan``, ``physical_network = p1``, ``segmentation = vlan 1`` to bottom. Data model impact ----------------- In database, we are considering setting physical_network in top OpenStack as ``bottom_physical_network#bottom_pod_id`` to distinguish segmentation information in different bottom OpenStack. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== When admin user creates network, he/she specifies the network type as one of the network type discussed above. In the phase of creating network in top OpenStack, only one record is saved in the database, no network will be created in bottom OpenStack. When user uses the network created by admin (how about tenant created network) to boot a VM, Nova API gateway checks the network type. For shared VLAN and shared VxLAN network, Nova API gateway directly uses the segmentation ID allocated by top Neutron to create network in bottom OpenStack. For mxied VLAN/VxLAN network, Nova API gateway first creates network in bottom OpenStack without specifying network type and segmentation ID, then update the top network with bottom network segmenation information returned by bottom OpenStack. `Neutron multi-segment network API`_ allows us to create virtual L2 networks made up of multiple segments with different details, so we can associate a top network with segmentation information in different bottom OpenStack. In database, Network Segment model has the following fields: ``network_id``, ``network_type``,``physical_network``,``is_dynamic`` and ``segment_index``, we are considering setting physical_network in top OpenStack as ``bottom_physical_network#bottom_pod_id`` to distinguish segmentation information in different bottom OpenStack. Segmentation information is passed to drivers to handle different scenarios. .. _`Neutron multi-segment network API`: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/ml2-multi-segment-api Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Other contributors: Work Items ---------- Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= None Documentation Impact ==================== None References ========== None ",,202,0

Neutron-LBaaS: Fix network_resources path

* upstream tempest changed the namespace for
  network_resources, this change updates that path
* fixed changed deprecated config parameters
* replaced network_cilent passed into DeletableSubnet
  with subnets_client and routers_client

Refactor gate hooks

The aim of this change is to make gate_hook and post_test_hook
more generic and prepare base for adding a new functional job
and tests. The patch also includes a number cosmetic changes
which should make the hooks' code easier to read.

- Moved all argument parsing to decode_args.sh.
- gate_hook: Extracted code related to configuring Octavia into a
  separate function.
- post_test_hook: Filling test_subset is not required if the aim
  is to run all set (api-* job).
- post_test_hook: Don't set OS_TEST_PATH and OS_TESTR_CONCURRENCY
  as it's also done in tox.ini.
- Style fixes.

This patch adds a mechanism to perform class initialization in Versioned
Objects.

One case where this is useful is when initializing the model class
attribute for all Persistent Versioned Objects.

We are currently trying to initialize the model class attribute for all
Versioned Objects in the registration hook, which is wrong on two
fronts, one is the place -it should be done in the
CinderPersistentObject- and the other is that we are doing it for all
classes -this could be easily fixed by checking if it's a
CinderPersistentObject class-.

This patch adds method `cinder_ovo_cls_init` to CinderPersistentObject
and changes the registration hook to call this method on any OVO class
that is registered if it exists.

1. What is the problem?
In production clouds, each availability zone (AZ) is built by modularized
OpenStack instances. Each OpenStack instance acts as a pod. One AZ
consists of multiple pods. Among the pods within an AZ, they are
classified into different categories for different proposes, for instance,
general propose, CAD modeling and so on. Each tenant is bound to one pod,
where it creates various types of resources. However such a binding
relationship should be dynamic instead of static. For instance when
some resources in the pod are exhausted, tenant needs to be bound to a
new pod in same AZ.

2. What is the solution to the problem?
To deal with the above problem, the Tricircle dynamically bind tenants
to pod which has available resources. We call this feature dynamic pod
binding

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle to realize
the solution?
To realize dynamic pod binding, the following features need to be
implemented in the Tricircle.
1) To collect the usage in pod daily to evaluate whether the threshold
is reached or not.
2) To filter and weigh all the available pods for cloud tenants to bind
a tenant to a proper pod.
3) To manage and maintain all the active and historical binding
relationship.

This spec explains how Tricircle binds pods to tenants dynamically
in detail.

AZs consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. These AZs offer cloud tenants the ability to operate production applications and databases which are more highly available, fault tolerant and scalable than would be possible from a single data center. In production clouds, each AZ is built by modularized OpenStack, and each OpenStack is one pod. Moreover, one AZ can include multiple pods. Among the pods, they are classified into different categories. For example, servers in one pod are only for general purposes, and the other pods may be built for heavy load CAD modeling with GPU. So pods in one AZ could be divided into different groups. Different pod groups for different purposes, and the VM's pricing and performance are also different. Motivation ======== When creating a VM with volume attached in one pod, and if a new volume is created in another pod, the attachment will fail. The volume should be in the same pod where the VM is, otherwise the volume and VM is not able to finish the attachment if they are located in different pods. Hence, Tricircle needs to bind pods with tenants dynamically. The dynamic pod binding should be aware of the differences in cost. Solution: dynamic pod binding =========================== Tricircle needs to select a proper pod for a duration, in this duration VM and volume will be created for this tenant in the same pod. If this pod's resources exhausted or reach the limit for new resource provisioning. It's quite big challenge as more and more resources added to one pod, at last you will reach limitation, and it's quite notorious for capacity expansion inside one pod, you have to estimate, calculate, monitoring, simulate, test, online grey expansion for controller nodes and network nodes…whenever you add new machines to the pod. Hence, Tricircle needs to change the current pod binding for the tenant. For example, suppose we have two groups of pods, and each group has 3 pods, i.e. GroupA( Pod1, Pod2, Pod3) for general purpose VM GroupB(Pod4, Pod5, Pod6), Tenant1 is bound to Pod1, Pod4 during the first phase for several months. When detecting that there is no more resources in Pod1, Pod4, Tricircle needs to change the binding, for example, Tenant1 binding to Pod2, Pod5 If the tenant wants to allocate VM/volume for general VM, select Pod1. It can be implemented with flavor or volume type metadata. For general VM/Volume, no special tag in flavor volume meta_data. If the tenant wants to allocate VM/volume for CAD modeling VM, select Pod4, For CAD modeling VM/Volume, special tag ""resource: CAD Modeling"" in flavor volume meta_data If the tenant wants to allocate VM/volume for general VM, select Pod2, If the tenant wants to allocate VM/volume for CAD modeling VM, select Pod4, In the first phase, we can just add weight in Pod, for example, Pod1, weight 1, Pod2, weight2, this could be done by one new field in pod table, or no field at all, just link them by the order is created in Tricircle Implementation ============ Measurement --------- To get the information of resource utilization of pods, Tricircle needs to conduct some measurements on pods. For resources usages, currently cells provided interface to retrieve usage for cells [1]. If OpenStack is not running with cells mode, we can ask Nova to provide usage info in AZ show detail interface. Cinder also provide interface [2] to retrieve the backend pool usage. In bottom The statistic task should be done in bottom pod. But probably it may not be enough to manage resources properly using only above kinds of statistics coming from bottoms. On top There are also some functions of nova running on top of bottoms to manage, but they are not aimed at pods but for compute nodes. On top there is no heavy process. So calculation, or whatever processes to manage resources on top of bottom properly should run on top of us. Another API for usage query is at host level [3]. If the bottom returns the sum, it's also ok. But currently only one host detail information is returned. Tricircle ------- Tricircle needs a framework to support different binding policy, or say, binding filter. Each pod is one OpenStack instance, including controller nodes and compute nodes. E.g., +-> controller(s) - pod1 <--> compute nodes <---+ | The tricircle +-> controller(s) - pod2 <--> compute nodes <---+ resource migration, if necessary (resource controller) .... | +-> controller(s) - pod{N} <--> compute nodes <-+ Tricircle is to select which controllers the VM/Volume creation request should be forwarded to. Then the controllers in the selected pod will do its own scheduling. The simplest binding filter will be like this: line up all pods in each group, and always select the first pod, when all the resources in the pod has been allocated, remove it from the list. This is quite like what production cloud is built: first only few pods, and then add more and more pods if there is no enough resources in current cloud. List1 for general pool: Pod1 <- Pod2 <- Pod3 List2 for CAD modeling pool: Pod4 <- Pod5 <- Pod6 If Pod4's resource exhausted, the List1 changed to: Pod5 <- Pod6 If Pod1's resource exhausted, the List1 changed to: Pod2 <- Pod3.

In the function test_get_network_interface_file:
first we check path returned when 'agent_server_network_dir' is defined.

In the tested function the code of taking 'agent_server_network_dir'
is unreachable if there is a non-empty sting in 'agent_server_network_file'.
Hence, to test this case we should first set 'agent_server_network_file'
to None.

To make objects that have other objects as fields compatible to an
earlier version, oslo versioned objects uses either a manifest passed to
obj_to_primitive or the object's obj_relationships mapping.

Which means that if we don't have any of those mechanisms in place our
rolling upgrades mechanism will fail whenever we try to backport a
Versioned Object that has set an ObjectField field because Oslo
Versioned Object will not know how to backport that related object.

This patch introduces the usage of manifests on backports when we are
doing rolling upgrades.

For the manifest, we use the data in our Objects History.  Which means
that as long as we keep history in OBJ_VERSIONS right we will not have
to create and worry about keeping lists' child_versions field or our
versioned object's obj_relationships for fields with types
ListOfObjectsField and ObjectField.

We also don't have to worry about cascade version bumping, as in
changing the List OVO version whenever the OVO it contains gets bumped,
or bumping our OVO whenever one of the related OVO fields is bumped.

Modified the logic to do zoneadd or zoneremove to
modify the zone members when an initiator zone
is being modified instead of current logic which
deletes the zone and recreates it, in which time
the existing targets lose connectivity to the
initiator because of cfgdisable.

Current implementation of novaclient.api_versions.wraps allow to use

managers can have versioned methods, resource objects can have it too, but

Changes:

 - Move `novaclient.utils.generate_function_name` to
   `novaclient.api_versions._generate_function_name`, since this method is

   module;
 - Rewrite _generate_function_name to handle class(owner) name. Previously,

   methods with equal names.
 - Remove call of generate_function_name from novaclient.shell. Shell module
   should not take care about function identifiers. get_substitutions accepts
   object with __id__ property now.
 - Mark _add_substitution as private method, since it should not be used
   outside api_versions module
 - Split all versioned methods of Server resource from novaclient.v2.servers

The Lego in the exercise represents the code of a software project, in this case OpenStack. The students all take on roles that represent various facets of the OpenStack community, including upstream roles like Foundation and TCT, and contributors like corporations, and individual free agents. The group is split into their new 'teams' at this stage. Facilitators can choose any way they prefer to do this (selecting teams, or allowing students to self-select). The recommended numbers are in the slides, but can be changed to suit the number of participants in the room. For a very large group, consider separating into two 'communities', which then have to fit their streets together (use the metaphor of an API for this) to complete the session. Give each person a nametag to wear, with their first name and their role written on it. For free agents, don't disclose who is distracted, controversial, or agreeable. The community will need to work this out on their own.Ahead of time: ensure the existing Lego buildings are set out on a table, but not connected to each other. All the unsorted bricks should be available in several smaller boxes in a different part of the room, for participants to use. There is no need to display the boxes or instruction manuals. Once the students are separated into their new roles, and have an understanding of the project, begin the timer for the first sprint. During the five minutes planning time, encourage each group to get together and think about their project. If possible, give each group a corner of the room and access to a whiteboard or flipchart. For companies, ensure the CEO sets a direction, and the team are on board. For upstream, have them think about the community standards they want to set. Free agent contributors can get straight to work during this phase. Suggestions: * Companies: big industrial items like a shopping mall, carpark, energy plant, datacenter, hospital. * Free agents: community items items like vegetable patches, bicycle paths, public artworks, playgrounds. For the controversial agent, problematic items such as a jail, skate bowl, dog park. * Upstream: consider guidelines around consistency in the bricks used, how to connect the road and sidewalk between the buildings, the kinds of buildings they should request the community to make, and the things they simply will not accept. Start the timer for building time, and allow everyone to start work. During each building phase, have mentors wander around the groups listening in and making suggestions, without actually doing any of the work or giving answers. In your interactions with the students, do not be afraid to provoke some issues. For example, bring up the idea of an API (a way of connecting the buildings to each other) with individual companies, but don't mention it to upstream, so that upstream are finally faced with the challenge of standardizing the API. You could also, in the second or third sprint, encourage one group to call a midcycle to sort the problem out. During the final five minutes of the sprint (review time), ask everyone to take their hands off the Lego, and gather around the in-progress street. At this stage, upstream get to vote on the changes, and anything rejected gets sent back to the contributing group to be fixed. Ensure upstream give good reasons for rejections, along with suggestions for improvement. Encourage Upstream to reject a few things early on, to try and ensure contributors understand the need to have Foundation on board before they throw something over the wall. At the end of the four sprints, ensure you take a group photo!","Agile for Contributors (15 min) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Apply agile * Who is the customer? * Company & Upstream product owner * Sprint review presentation to UpstreamThe students make a virtual contribution simulation using Lego bricks as props, with the goal of expanding a Lego town, built by upstream.

Remove some Pacemaker constraints that should not be useful:

keystone-then-nova-consoleauth-constraint
Nova-consoleauth won't fail if keystone is not started.
The constrain was useless.

nova-consoleauth-then-nova-vncproxy-constraint and
nova-vncproxy-with-nova-consoleauth-colocation
Both services don't need ordering neither collocation, they can live in
separated nodes, I confirmed that with Nova folks.

nova-vncproxy-then-nova-api-constraint and
nova-api-with-nova-vncproxy-colocation
Nova API & Nova VNCproxy do not need to live together or need specific
ordering at all.

nova-api-then-nova-scheduler-constraint and
nova-scheduler-with-nova-api-colocation
Nova API and Nova Scheduler do not need to live together or need
specific ordering at all.

nova-scheduler-then-nova-conductor-constraint and

Nova Conductor and Nova Scheduler do not need to live together or need

The purpose of this change is to speed up the integrated gate.
The first playbook of the deploy will need to sort the rabbitmq
servers and set the fact but subsequent playbooks can avoid that
work. This could save 5-10 minutes in the integrated gate right now.

The change should be very low impact for deployers. The facts cache
is well documented (currently under Troubleshooting). Secondly, the
existing trailing task to record the sorted servers as a fact is
updated to better expose the task's impact on cached facts. If a
deployer changes the rabbitmq servers in the deploy infrastructure
they will need to clear the cached facts or run without fact caching
as documented.

I can't find any other doc impacts right now but may have missed one.

In a recent commit we moved away from wrapping network responses in
those weird object wrappers during scenario tests. This greatly
cleaned up the code and made things more consistent. However, there
was 1 getattr that was missed. It wasn't caught in the gate because
this call path wasn't executed (although a 3rd party CI did hit it).
This shows the importance of testing and making sure we don't rely
too heavily on self verification. This commit corrects the oversight
and cleans up the last reference to the network object wrappers.

For both the developer and new user use cases, there is rarely a
need to do anything before the undercloud is installed and images
and nodes are uploaded and registered. This patch moves up the
default stopping point to just before the overcloud deploy command
is run. This behavior is still changeable by changing the tags
passed to quickstart.sh.

Also fixes a small UI bug, where usage instructions get print out
even when not using quickstart's default playbook. These instructions
are unlikely to be accurate when used with a different playbook.

This adds the check to the nova-network API allocate_for_instance
method such that if no network is allocated for the instance and
'auto' was requested, we raise an error.

Also, if 'auto' is requested, we pass requested_networks=None
to the network rpc api (and network manager) since a network
with uuid 'auto' isn't going to exist.

Similar handling is done for deallocate_for_instance.

Some of the unit tests for allocate had to be fixed to pass
a valid requested_networks value.

This adds the auto-allocated-topology validation into
the neutron validate_networks path, which is called from
the compute API when creating instances.

If there are no available networks for the project and the
user specifically requested that a network be automatically
allocated for them (via the 'auto' network id on the request),
then we have to check that:

1. The auto-allocated-topology extension is available in neutron.
2. The dry-run validation for auto-allocated-topology passes.

Otherwise we fail the request with a 409 error. Since the
network API is raising a new type of exception, we have to handle
it in the REST API.

It is possible to deprecate an option, but there's no clear way to
state when this deprecation occured and when the option will actually
go away. This leaves the user with a decision to make. Nova, for
example, frequently includes the release that the option was removed in
as part of the help message like so:

    ""memcached_servers"" opt is deprecated in Mitaka. In Newton release
    oslo.cache config options should be used as this option will be
    removed.

This is a decision that the user shouldn't have to make. Add a
'deprecated_since' parameter to allow users to specify this information
in a uniform manner. The parameter allows for any string value.

A future work item would add a hacking or tox check to compare this
parameter against the expected deprecation version. For example, to
ensure all Nova parameters deprecated in '13.0' should be removed in
'14.0'. This will be done on a per-project basis.

This guide is intended as a best practice and should be followed strictly by new services. Existing services should follow this guide wherever possible and try to move towards this goal. This document is intended primarily as a guide for the server side, some sections may contains notes about deprecated behaviour that is still allowed but it does not go into all the quirks for all the services that would be required to implement a version discovery parser that works for everyone. Individual Version Entry ------------------------ An API version is exposed as a series of attributes: .. code:: { ""id"": ""--id--"", ""status"": ""--status--"", ""updated"": ""--datetime--"", ""media-types"": [ { ""base"": ""--base--"", ""type"": ""--type--"" } ], ""links"": [ { ""href"": ""--url--"", ""rel"": ""--rel--"" } ] } Individual version base URLs (eg at ""http://localhost:5000/v3"") will return a version object under the key of ``version`` with a status of 200 OK. Although discovery endpoints should not be access controlled, this has occurred in the past and should be expected by anyone attempting to read them. For example: .. code:: Status: 200 OK { ""version"": { ""id"": ""3.0"", ""status"": ""stable"", ""updated"": ""2013-03-06T00:00:00Z"", ""media-types"": [ { ""base"": ""application/json"", ""type"": ""application/vnd.openstack.identity-v3+json"" }, { ""base"": ""application/xml"", ""type"": ""application/vnd.openstack.identity-v3+xml"" } ], ""links"": [ { ""href"": ""."", ""rel"": ""self"" } ] } } ``id`` ****** *This is a required field* The ``id`` is the version identifier of an API endpoint. ``id``` is specified as a string in the format ``{major}.{minor}.{patch}``, for example ``2.1.5``. A patch version is optional and is considered 0 if not provided. Id versions follow semantic versioning and thus backwards compatibility is implied by a version numbering with the same major version and higher minor version number. For example an advertised version of ``2.3`` will maintain compatibility with of its calls with versions ``2.0``, ``2.1``, and ``2.2`` as well as all included patch versions. Because of this compatibility only the most recent version need be provided to indicate compatibility with previous minor versions. For compatibility purposes a version number may be proceeded by the letter ``v``. This should not be supported by future versions and should be completely ignored when parsing, so a retrieved id of ``v3.2`` is exactly the same as an id of ``3.2.0``. New projects should not use the ``v``. ``status`` ********** *This is a required field* The ``status`` reflects the state of the endpoint on the service. The following table presents endpoints in the order in which they should be prioritized. Stable defines whether the API is undergoing changes, for example, if the API version is still under development. .. list-table:: Status Definitions :header-rows: 1 * - Name - Stable - Description * - ``CURRENT`` - Yes - This version is up to date recent and may receive future versions. This endpoint should be prioritized over all others. * - ``SUPPORTED`` - Yes - This version is available on the server, however is not likely the most recent available and may not be updated or may be deprecated at some time in the future. * - ``DEPRECATED`` - Yes - This version is still available but is being deprecated and may be removed in the future. * - ``EXPERIMENTAL`` - No - This version is under development or contains features that are otherwise subject to change. ``updated`` *********** An ISO8601 formatted timestamp indicating the last update of this version status or number. This is updated when a new version is available or the ``status`` of the endpoint changes. It does not require changing on every API update to an unstable endpoint. ``media-types`` *************** The formats in which this API is exposed. It is provided in a list of objects consisting of: ``base`` The basic mime type of the endpoint, for example, ""application/json"" ``type`` A detailed specific application mime type, for example, ""application/vnd.openstack.volume+json;version=1"" ``links`` ********* *This is a required field*. *Additionally, a* ``rel`` *of* ``self`` *link must be present.* *Further, each* ``link`` *object must contain at least a* ``rel`` *and* ``href`` *element.* ``links`` is specified as a list of objects containing: ``rel`` The type of link being referenced. Supported ``rel`` types are: * ``self`` - The base URL for this version. * ``describedby`` - Documentation of this version of the API. ``type`` The mime type that is available at the specified link. This is generally used only in conjunction with the ``describedby`` link type and describes the type of documentation, for example, ``application/pdf``. ``href`` A link to the base endpoint of the API. This is specified in normal href syntax, in that it supports: * absolute URLs, for example, ``http://service/`` * relative URLs, for example, ``/compute`` or ``compute``. This extends to allowing path traversal using the ``.`` and ``..`` paths. Relative links should be preferred here unless the service exists on a different host or protocol. This means that the typical ``self`` link when requesting a versioned endpoint (for example, ``/v3``) is going to simply be ``.``. A difference from the standard href linking syntax is that all urls provided by the ``href`` element are read to be folder elements. For example, if a request to ``http://service/prefix`` returned an endpoint of ``v1`` then the endpoint is deemed to be at ``http://service/prefix/v1/`` as if the request was sent to ``http://service/prefix/`` and the endpoint returned was ``v1/`` (note the trailing slashes). This is intended to allow some leeway in configuration for operators and maintain backwards compatability and not an indication that trailing slashes should be removed from the link. Root Discovery -------------- The base entry point to a service will expose a list of versions keyed under the ``versions`` key. The information in each version information should be exactly the same as what is provided by each versioned endpoint (with the obvious exception that relative links will need to be relative to the current URL). The return status code should be **200 OK**. Discovery endpoints should not be access controlled. Because greater minor versions include all smaller minor versions individually minor versions should not be included but considered available by other services. Consider this example: .. code:: Status: 300 { ""versions"": [ { ""status"": ""CURRENT"", ""updated"": ""2013-03-06T00:00:00Z"", ""media-types"": [ { ""base"": ""application/json"", ""type"": ""application/vnd.openstack.identity-v3+json"" }, { ""base"": ""application/xml"", ""type"": ""application/vnd.openstack.identity-v3+xml"" } ], ""id"": ""3.0"", ""links"": [ { ""href"": ""/v3/"", ""rel"": ""self"" } ] }, { ""status"": ""SUPPORTED"", ""updated"": ""2013-03-06T00:00:00Z"", ""media-types"": [ { ""base"": ""application/json"", ""type"": ""application/vnd.openstack.identity-v2.0+json"" }, { ""base"": ""application/xml"", ""type"": ""application/vnd.openstack.identity-v2.0+xml"" } ], ""id"": ""2.0"", ""links"": [ { ""href"": ""/v2/"", ""rel"": ""self"" }, { ""href"": ""http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-identity-service/2.0/content/"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""rel"": ""describedby"" }, { ""href"": ""http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-identity-service/2.0/identity-dev-guide-2.0.pdf"", ""type"": ""application/pdf"", ""rel"": ""describedby"" } ] } ] } By convention an endpoint version will be mounted under the subpath ``/v{major}`` (for example, ``/v3`` as shown above), however, this is not required so long as the URLs available from discovery are correct.

We now have unit, functional, and tempest tests in tree. To avoid
confusion, we need to make sure it's clear what each of these test
types are intended to be used for.

This adds a description for each test type and cleans up some of
the documentation around testing in general.

Any proposed code change will be automatically rejected by the OpenStack Jenkins server [#f1]_ if the change causes unit test failures. Running the tests ----------------- There are a number of ways to run unit tests currently, and there's a combination of frameworks used depending on what commands you use. The preferred method is to use tox, which calls ostestr via the tox.ini file. To run all tests simply run:: tox This will create a virtual environment, load all the packages from test-requirements.txt and run all unit tests as well as run flake8 and hacking checks against the code. Note that you can inspect the tox.ini file to get more details on the available options and what the test run does by default. Running a subset of tests using tox ----------------------------------- One common activity is to just run a single test, you can do this with tox simply by specifying to just run py27 or py34 tests against a single test:: tox -epy27 -- -n cinder.tests.unit.test_volume.AvailabilityZoneTestCase.test_list_availability_zones_cached Or all tests in the test_volume.py file:: tox -epy27 -- -n cinder.tests.unit.test_volume For more information on these options and how to run tests, please see the `ostestr documentation <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/os-testr/>`_. Run tests wrapper script ------------------------ In addition you can also use the wrapper script run_tests.sh by simply executing:: ./run_tests.sh This script is a wrapper around the testr testrunner and the flake8 checker. Note that there has been talk around deprecating this wrapper and this method of testing, it's currently available still but it may be good to get used to using tox or even ostestr directly. Documentation is left in place for those that still use it. Flags ----- The ``run_tests.sh`` script supports several flags. You can view a list of flags by doing:: run_tests.sh -h This will show the following help information:: Usage: ./run_tests.sh [OPTION]... Run Cinder's test suite(s) -V, --virtual-env Always use virtualenv. Install automatically if not present -N, --no-virtual-env Don't use virtualenv. Run tests in local environment -s, --no-site-packages Isolate the virtualenv from the global Python environment -r, --recreate-db Recreate the test database (deprecated, as this is now the default). -n, --no-recreate-db Don't recreate the test database. -x, --stop Stop running tests after the first error or failure. -f, --force Force a clean re-build of the virtual environment. Useful when dependencies have been added. -p, --pep8 Just run pep8 -P, --no-pep8 Don't run pep8 -c, --coverage Generate coverage report -h, --help Print this usage message --hide-elapsed Don't print the elapsed time for each test along with slow test list Because ``run_tests.sh`` is a wrapper around testr, it also accepts the same flags as testr. See the `testr documentation`_ for details about these additional flags. .. _testr documentation: https://testrepository.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ .. _nose options documentation: http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/usage.html#options Running a subset of tests ------------------------- Instead of running all tests, you can specify an individual directory, file, class, or method that contains test code. To run the tests in the ``cinder/tests/scheduler`` directory:: ./run_tests.sh scheduler To run the tests in the ``cinder/tests/test_libvirt.py`` file:: ./run_tests.sh test_libvirt To run the tests in the `HostStateTestCase` class in ``cinder/tests/test_libvirt.py``:: ./run_tests.sh test_libvirt.HostStateTestCase To run the `ToPrimitiveTestCase.test_dict` test method in ``cinder/tests/test_utils.py``:: ./run_tests.sh test_utils.ToPrimitiveTestCase.test_dict Virtualenv ---------- By default, the tests use the Python packages installed inside a virtualenv [#f2]_. (This is equivalent to using the ``-V, --virtualenv`` flag). If the virtualenv does not exist, it will be created the first time the tests are run. If you wish to recreate the virtualenv, call ``run_tests.sh`` with the flag:: -f, --force Recreating the virtualenv is useful if the package dependencies have changed since the virtualenv was last created. If the ``requirements.txt`` or ``tools/install_venv.py`` files have changed, it's a good idea to recreate the virtualenv. By default, the unit tests will see both the packages in the virtualenv and the packages that have been installed in the Python global environment. In some cases, the packages in the Python global environment may cause a conflict with the packages in the virtualenv. If this occurs, you can isolate the virtualenv from the global environment by using the flag:: -s, --no-site packages If you do not wish to use a virtualenv at all, use the flag:: -N, --no-virtual-env Database -------- Some of the unit tests make queries against an sqlite database. By default, the test database (``tests.sqlite``) is deleted and recreated each time ``run_tests.sh`` is invoked (This is equivalent to using the ``-r, --recreate-db`` flag). To reduce testing time if a database already exists it can be reused by using the flag:: -n, --no-recreate-db Reusing an existing database may cause tests to fail if the schema has changed. If any files in the ``cinder/db/sqlalchemy`` have changed, it's a good idea to recreate the test database. Gotchas ------- **Running Tests from Shared Folders** If you are running the unit tests from a shared folder, you may see tests start to fail or stop completely as a result of Python lockfile issues. You can get around this by manually setting or updating the following line in ``cinder/tests/conf_fixture.py``:: CONF['lock_path'].SetDefault('/tmp') Note that you may use any location (not just ``/tmp``!) as long as it is not a shared folder. .. rubric:: Footnotes .. [#f1] See :doc:`jenkins`. .. [#f2] See :doc:`development.environment` for more details about the use of virtualenv. **Running py34 tests** You will need to install: python3-dev in order to get py34 tests to run.

The os-win vhdutils resize method, by default, treats the requested
size as the maximum VHD/x file size. Considering the size of the
internal metadata, the virtual size of the image will be slightly
smaller.

Resizing an image may fail when the image size is close to the
requested size, in which case the new calculated internal size may be
smaller than the current image internal size.

This fix consists in going back to the old behavior (pre os-win),
ensuring that the new VHD/x internal size always matches the requested
VHD/x size, regardless of the internal metadata overhead (which is
really small anyway).

In Cinder we don't have an indirection service to forward object methods
like Nova does (Conductor) so we shouldn't be defining all methods as
remotable since they are not.

If we ever decide to have a Conductor we can easily add them back where
appropriate, but for now they are only a hindrance:

- It's confusing, because most people don't understand what it actually
  means in Cinder and they just add it to the methods because they see
  it in other OVO methods.
- Every time we change a remote method's signature or add a new remote
  method to an object the hash of that object changes and we need to
  update our test_versions test, which is not necessary.
- This makes the linking of VOs with their list counterparts
  problematic, because everyone will need to know that there is no need
  to bump the version of a list object whenever they add or modify a
  remotable method.
- We are executing unnecessary code with decorators, even if it's not
  much, it's still wasted CPU time .

This patch removes all appearances of remotable and remotable_class
decorators thus making our OVOs consistent with our implementation and
removing the need of updating our tests on unrelated OVO changes.

When Conditional Update mechanism was introduced `conditional_update`
method was added to `CinderObject` instead of `CinderPersistenObject`.

Because this method was added to `CinderObject` other methods were added
as well.

And so we ended up with methods that make no sense in the base OVO
class, as they are only relevant for objects that have persistence and
can be retrieved from the DB.

This patch moves these methods (`get_by_id`, `refresh`,
`_get_expected_attrs`, and `conditional_update`) to
`CinderPersistentObject` where they should have been all along.

This test performs a backup followed by a restore and compares
the restored data with the original data.

This code was previously in the freezer-api repo. It fits better
into the freezer repo because:

- It interacts mostly with freezer-scheduler
- The freezer devstack gate also includes the freezer-api so it is easier to run an end-to-end test

Moved from change: 319351

Implements bp: freezer-integration-tests

The former commit was merged without PTL approval or an intent
communicated by champion on the proposal. Having such merged proposals
disrupts the direction and roadmap for the project. So, we need to merge
a group of specs that are non-overlapping. We will know what those specs
at the glance virtual midcycle during the week of Jun 13.

This reverts commit af02b822e0c6dd7e05956c3a9fe439e57bbb8498.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================================== Add distinction layer in domain model ===================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/glance/+spec/add-distinction-layer To improve the stability and performance it is suggested to make changes in the domain by adding distinction layer, which will store all changes of the object and pass to DB only modified attributes. Problem description =================== Current Glance Images v2 architectures have a defect associated with risks of race conditions arising under heavy load on the system. Here is an example of the race condition: Suppose an image has properties ``{""foo"": ""bar"", ""goo"": ""far""}``. User1 wants to change ``{""foo"": ""baz""}``. User2 wants to change ``{""goo"": ""yuck""}``. If user1 and user2 make concurrent requests, they both get the same data to work with. Suppose user1's change gets written first, resulting in: ``{""foo"": ""baz"", ""goo"": ""far""}``. Then user2's change is written, resulting in: ``{""foo"": ""bar"", ""goo"": ""yuck""}``. User1's change has been reverted, which is not desired behavior. Besides this, there is an issue of unreasonably increased load on the database when updating. This problem occurs because all image fields are being updated each time whether they've been modified or not, so there is lots of unnecessary traffic on the database. Also there is an issue an issue with changing the status of the image. These issues do not appear at low load, but in the future, with wider use, it can lead to serious problems, such as loss of information and unstable behaviour. A more detailed description of the problems can be found on references [7]_ and [8]_. Proposed change =============== When updating of image the original image is retrieved from the database. Distinction layer creates dict representation of modified image and compares it with the original one. Then it passes to DB layer dict of modified attributes. Continuing the example from the previous section, consider the situation after user1's update has been processed and ``{""foo"": ""baz""}`` in the database. User2's distinction layer image record contains ``{""foo"": ""bar""}``, since that was the state of the image when the fetch occurred. However, since user2's change request doesn't touch ``foo``, only ``{""goo"": ""yuck""}`` will be written to the database. Thus the final image record will have ``{""foo"": ""baz"", ""goo"": ""yuck""}`` as both users intend. Of course, if user2 does actually change the value of ``foo``, then user2's change will be persisted in the database, but this is expected behavior. Alternatives ------------ There have been attempts to solve the problem using inheritance. References on commits [1]_, [2]_. But commits were abandoned, because inheritance is contrary to the Glance design strategy of favoring flat hierarchies and preferring aggregation over inheritance. Alternatively, it was suggested to forbid updates while an image is in ""saving"" state. But this idea was rejected, because images tend to be in status 'saving' for a relatively long period, and users expect to be able to modify the image record during this time. Also it fixes only a special case, when status is 'saving', but the whole problem with race conditions and unreasonably increased load on the database is still here. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ Performance tests were conducted. We used the database: MySQL Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.47 We determined the time spent in update one parameter of image. Tests showed the dependence of the execution time of the number of requests. Test code is presented in [3]_. We tested two versions of the code: 1) ""master"" branch; 2) commit ""Add distinction layer"" [6]_. The results are presented in table [4]_ and graph [5]_. Graph showed the dependence of the execution time of the number of requests: * Blue line - ""master"" branch; * Red line - commit ""Add distinction layer"" [6]_. The testing concluded that the use of distinction layer accelerates update average of 34.54%. Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- dshakhray Reviewers --------- mfedosin nikhil rosmaita Work Items ---------- 1) Implement distinction layer: a. Create a distinction layer and add it to 'gateway.py' b. Add classes ImageProxy, ImageRepoProxy, ImageFactoryProxy. c. Add to ImageRepoProxy class methods get, add, save. d. Add the class ImageRepoProxy additional methods to implement the logic. e. Make the appropriate changes in the 'db/simple/api.py', 'db/simple/api.py', 'db/__init__.py'. 2) Add related functional and unit tests. 3) Write a documentation about this layer. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Unit and functional tests will be added as appropriate.

This patch adds few functional tests to test OVN NB DB sync
and adds the gate hook script functions.

The functional test setup
 - will start an ovsdb-server with OVN NB DB.
 - will start an ovsdb-server with OVN SB DB. This connection is
   not used by this patch. But it is created because
      - It can be used later to test the chassis up/down events.
      - ML2 OVN driver now also connects to the OVN SB DB.
 - The ML2 OVN driver is configured to connect to these ovsdb-servers
 - Another IDL connection is established with the OVN NB DB server.

The test cases are validated by checking if the OVN NB DB is
updated properly or not.

This can be extended later to add more functional tests and
full stack tests if required.

are already in use in telemetry projects where global requirements

* fixes to header evaluation
* $LAST_URL and $COOKIE substitutions

When microversion>=2.26 is requested to show server details
we should pre-load 'tags' when getting the instance from the
database. Listing server details already does this, but show
didn't.

Failing to do this can also result in a 500 response from the
server. The scenario is you delete a server and then poll for
it to be gone using 'nova show'. In between the time that the
server is retrieved from the database and the view builder
creates the response, the instance is deleted and since
instance.tags is not set it will attempt to lazy-load the tags
which will fail with an InstanceNotFound.

We need to also fix the lazy-load issue in the instance object
but that will come in a follow-on change.

This commit introduce new function openstack_resource_id_getter.
It accepts resource command string and returns resource UUID.
Function uses Puppet::Provider::Openstack::Auth library.

This commit fixes recently found issues with converting
images in nova format to glance v2.

1. If property string is unicode we shouldn't convert it
to str.

2. kernel_id and ramdisk_id are custom properties and for
this reason they have to be processed on 'properties' layer
and not with regular attributes.

3. In glance v1 it was possible to set empty string to
kernel_id and ramdisk_id properties. In glance v2 it's
forbidden and that's why we have to convert them to
None values.

Problem description =================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sahara/+spec/image-generation-cli Sahara has historically used a single monolithic repository of DIB elements for generation of images. This poses several problems: - Unlike most use cases for DIB, Sahara end-users are not necessarily OpenStack experts, and are using OpenStack as a means to manage their data processing clusters, but desire to customize their nodes at the image level. As these users are concerned with data processing over cloud computing, ease of image modification is critical in the early stages of technology evaluation. The Sahara team has found that while DIB is a very powerful tool, it is not overly friendly to new adopters. - In order to mature to a stage at which new Sahara users can add features to the codebase cleanly, Sahara must draw firmer lines of encapsulation around its plugins. Storing all image generation recipes (whatever the implementation) in a single repository that cuts across all plugins is counter to the end goal of allowing the whole functionality of a new plugin to be exposed at a single path. - Sahara end users will very seldom need to modify base OS images in a particularly deep way, and will seldom need to create new images. The changes Sahara must make to images in order to prepare them for use are actually quite basic: we install packages and modify certain configuration files. Sacrificing some power and speed for some ease of use is very reasonable in our use case. For these reasons, a means to encapsulate image generation logic within a plugin, a command line utility to exercise these recipes, and a backing toolchain that emphasizes reliability over flexibility and speed are indicated. Proposed change =============== The https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sahara/+spec/validate-image-spi blueprint describes the first steps of this epic, enabling us to define recipes for image validation and generation of clusters from ""clean"" images. CLI input --------- The current specification proposes that a CLI script be added to sahara at sahara.cli.sahara_pack_image.py. This script will not start a new service as others do; rather, it will use the pre-existent sahara.services.images module to run the image generation recipe on a base image through a new remote implementation. This remote implementation will use libguestfs'python API to alter the image to the plugin's specifications. --help text for this script follows: :: Usage: sahara-image-create -p PLUGIN list|of|plugins|as|loaded|from|stevedore -v VERSION versions|as|loaded|from|stevedore|if|plugin|set -i IMAGE_PATH [-t] [More arguments per plugin and version] * -i, --image: The path to an image to modify. This image will be modified in-place: be sure to target a copy if you wish to maintain a clean master image. * -p, --plugin: The name of the Sahara plugin for which you would like to generate an image. Use sahara-image-create -p PLUGIN -h to see a set of versions for a specific plugin. * -v, --version: The version of the Sahara plugin for which you would like to generate an image. Use sahara-image-create -p PLUGIN -v VERSION -h to see a full set of arguments for a specific plugin and version. * -t, --test: If this flag is set, no changes will be made to the image; instead, the script will fail if discrepancies are found between the image and the intended state. [* variable per plugin and version: Other arguments as specified in the generation script. * ...] * -h, --help: See this message. If -t is set, the image will be packed with the ``reconcile`` option set to False (meaning that the image will only be tested, not changed.) Each image generation .yaml (as originally described in the validate-images-spi spec,) may now register a set of 'arguments' as well as a set of 'validators'. This argument specification should precede the validator declaration, and will take the following form: :: arguments: - java-version: description: The java distribution. argnames: [j, java-version] target_variable: JAVA_VERSION default: openjdk required: false enum: - oracle-java - openjdk A set of arguments for any one yaml must obey the following rules: * At least one argname must be proviced. * Argnames may contain up to one single-letter member and up to one multiple- letter member. * All argnames must be unique, and no argnames may collide with global script argument tokens. * If required is false, a default value must be provided. * The target_variable field is required, for clarity. An ImageArgument class will be added to sahara.service.images.py in order that all plugins can use the same object format. It will follow the object model above. New SPI methods --------------- In order to facilitate the retrieval of image generation arguments, a get_image_arguments SPI method will be added to the plugin SPI. The arguments returned from this method will be used to build help text specific to a plugin and version, and will also be used to validate input to the CLI. It will return a list of ImageArguments. A pack_image method will also be added to the plugin SPI. This method will have the signature: :: def pack_image(remote, reconcile=True, argument_map=None, **kwargs) This method will take an ImageRemote (see below). In most plugins, this will: * Validate the incoming argument map (to ensure that all required arguments have been provided, that values exist in any given enum, etc.) * Place the incoming arguments into an env_map per their target_variables. * Generate a set of ImageValidators (just as is done for image validation) * Call the validate method of the validator set using the remote and argument_map. However, the implementation is intentionally vague, to allow plugins to introduce their own image packing tools if desired (as per the validate-images-spi spec.) ArgumentCaseValidator --------------------- Now that these image definitions need to be able to take arguments, a new ArgumentCaseValidator will be added to the set of concrete SaharaImageValidators to assist image packing developers in writing clean, readable recipes. This validator's yaml definition will take the form: :: argument_case: variable_name: JAVA_VERSION cases: openjdk: - [action] oracle-java: - [action] The first value case key which matches the value of one of the variable will execute its nested actions. All subsequent cases will be skipped. ImageRemote ----------- A new ImageRemote class will be added to the sahara.services.images module. This class will represent a subset of the functionality of the Remote class we use for instance manipulation over ssh. Rather than executing ssh commands from the provided arguments, however, this class will execute scripts on a target image using libguestfs' python API. The CLI will use generate a remote targeting the image at the path specified by the 'image' argument, and use it to run the scripts which would normally be run over ssh (on clean image generation) within the image file specified. Alternatives ------------ We have discussed the option of bring DIB elements into the Sahara plugins. However, this was nixed due to the issues above related to tradeoff between speed and power and usability, and because of certain testing issues (discussed in an abandoned spec in the Mitaka cycle). It is also possible that we could maintain our current CLI in sahara-image-elements indefinitely. However, as more plugins are developed, a single monolithic repository will become unwieldy. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- The new CLI will be (at present) the only means of interacting with this feature. Deployer impact --------------- Packaging this script as a separate python (and Debian/RPM package) is an option worth discussing, but at this time it is intended that this tool be packed with the Sahara core. Developer impact ---------------- This feature will reuse definitions specified in the validate-image-spi spec, and thus should have minimal developer impact from that spec. Sahara-image-elements impact ---------------------------- This feature will hopefully, once it reaches full maturity and testability, supplant sahara-image-elements, and will provide the baseline for building image packing facility into the sahara API itself. Sahara-dashboard / Horizon impact --------------------------------- No dashboard representation is intended at this time. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: egafford Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Create and unit test images.py changes. * Test plugin-specific image packing for any plugins to implement this feature. Intended first round of plugins to implement: * Implement CI tests for this feature. Dependencies ============ * This feature will introduce a dependency on libguestfs, though it will only use libguestfs features present in all major distributions. Testing ======= As this feature does not touch the API, it will not introduce new Tempest tests. However, testing the image generation process itself will require attention. It is proposed that tests be added for image generation as each plugin implements this generation strategy, and that nightly tests be created to generate images and run these images through cluster creation and EDP testing. These should be implemented as separate tests in order to quickly differentiate image packing failure and cluster failure. As these recipes stabilize for any given plugin, we should begin to run these tests when any change to the sahara repository touches image generation resources for a specific plugin (which should be well-encapsulated in a single directory under each version for each plugin.) Toward the end of this epic (as we are nearing the stage of authoring the API to pack images, we may consider removing integration tests for SIE to save lab time. Still, these tests will be, compared to sahara service tests, very resource-light to run.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================== DIB Elements From URI ===================== Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tripleo/+spec/dib-elements-from-uri Currently, diskimage-builder (DIB) supports element discovery by searching a sequence of on disk directories which each contain a set of elements. This works great for the use case of a single project writing their own elements but this discourages the use of externally created elements that are shared among projects. Problem Description =================== As a developer I want to publish an element for my project. Currently, there is no established workflow for this other than to add the element to DIB in tree elements or to another use case specific set of elements (like TripleO's image elements). There is also no great option for me to publish an element in a way where a user can easily add it to a disk-image-create command. As a user I want to consume a specific element for my image. Currently, the element could be published any number of ways (see previous paragraph). Additionally, if it is part of an elements set or inside of a project specific repository I have to create the elements dir locally, clone the repositories in to it, and then add it to my dib path. This workflow could be *a lot* easier. Proposed Change =============== Overview -------- Support specifying elements by a URI. An example usage would be: disk-image-create <some args> element1 https://git.openstack.org/openstack/somerepo element2 This would look for a dib-elements directory inside of the specified repository and all of the elements inside of that directory would be added to the image build. The following usage can select a single element inside of a dib-elements directory: disk-image-create <some args> element1 https://git.openstack.org/openstack/somerepo:someelement element2 Alternatives ------------ We could use an external tool which would build up an elements directory before an image build. This would have the downside of adding complexity we expose to the user. Security Impact --------------- We should advise users to only use secure transports (https) and elements from trusted sources when using this as this will execute code as root on their computer. Other End User Impact --------------------- This is a usre facing feature and will need to be documented in the user guide. Performance Impact ------------------ There are obvious performance implications from relying on data retrieved over a network. We should attempt to cache this data when ever possible to minimize the impact. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- This is an opt-in feature and therefore should not have any unknown impact to our users. Developer Impact ---------------- This should decrease the need for us to host elements in the DIB source code tree and push for more projects to host elements in their own repositories. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Gregory Haynes <greg@greghaynes.net> Work Items ---------- * Create the tooling to set up the on disk state disk-image-create will base a build off of. * Document the feature Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= We can create a trivial test case in our CI by referencing some of the elements in the diskimage-builder repository by git.openstack.org URI. Documentation Impact ==================== This needs to be documented in both the user and developer guides. References ========== None ",,134,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================================== Add transaction layer in domain model ===================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/glance/+spec/add-transaction-layer To improve the stability and performance it is suggested to make changes in the domain by adding transaction layer, which will store all changes of the object and pass to DB only modified attributes. Problem description =================== Current Glance Images v2 and Artifact architectures have a defect associated with risks of race conditions arising under heavy load on the system. Besides this, there is an issue of unreasonably increased load on the database when updating, and also an issue with changing the status of the image. These issues do not appear at low load, but in the future, with wider use, it can lead to serious problems, such as loss of information and unstable behaviour. Proposed change =============== I propose adding transaction layer, which will store all changes of the object and pass to DB only modified attributes Alternatives ------------ There have been attempts to solve the problem using inheritance.

This compacts all database migrations up to Kilo into one
initial schema. We are currently creating, updating, dropping,
and modifying the database on installation for every change
since the beginning. This is very inefficient. This will now
limit the number of changes done to the database for new

Kilo before moving to Newton or later. Since Kilo is now EOL,

Many of the documentation pages in the security role aren't
meant to be displayed in a table of contents, and this was generating
lots of warnings in the sphinx output. This patch sets the :orphan:
tag on any pages that shouldn't appear inside a toctree.

Manual backport of I1b1f95e35946731ab1122bb1835bbd448b356acc due to
changes made in master that don't apply to stable branches.

Many of the documentation pages in the security role aren't
meant to be displayed in a table of contents, and this was generating
lots of warnings in the sphinx output. This patch sets the :orphan:
tag on any pages that shouldn't appear inside a toctree.

Manual backport of I1b1f95e35946731ab1122bb1835bbd448b356acc due to
changes made in master that don't apply to stable branches.

Thus, if a driver interface changes, you will need to upgrade your custom driver to meet the new driver contract.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The most common API changes will be adding methods to support new features. The new method must be implemented by custom driver implementations.We will do our best not to update existing methods in ways that will break custom driver implementations. However, if that is not possible, again you will need to upgrade your custom driver implementation to meet the new driver contract.","Driver Versioning ----------------- In the past the driver class was named ``Driver`` and changes would sometimes be devastating to developers that depend on our driver contracts. To help alleviate some of the issues we are now creating version driver classes, e.g. ``DriverV8``. We'll be supporting the current driver version for at least one version back. This gives developers a full cycle to update their drivers. Some cases, such as critical security flaws, may require a change to be introduced that breaks compatibility. These special cases will be communicated as widely as possible via the typical OpenStack communication channels. As new driver interface versions are added old ones will be moved to a ""deprecated"" state and will output deprecation messages when used. When a driver version moves from ""deprecated"" to ""unsupported"" it will be removed from the keystone source tree.-------------- The most common API changes will be adding method to support new features. We'll do our best to add methods in a way that is backward compatible. The new version of the driver will define the new method as an ``abc.abstractmethod`` that must be implemented by driver implementations. When possible we'll also go back to our supported drivers and add the method, with a default implementation. For example, given a ``thing.DriverV8`` that added a new method ``list_things_by_name()``, we will go back to ``thing.DriverV7`` and implement that method. This is good because in many cases your driver will just work, but there are a couple of unfortunate side effects. First if you have already used that method name you will have to rename your method and cut a new version. Second is that the default implementation may cause a performance penalty due to its naive implementation.We will try not to update existing methods in ways that will break old driver implementations.

Note that this change only impacts use of this charm when
Distributed Virtual Routing is enabled in a deployment.

Switch the generated configuration to use ""new"" style external
networks when ext-port is not set.  In this case we configure:

  external_network_bridge = (intentionally blank)
  gateway_external_network_id = (blank)

The current template configures external networks by using the default
external_network_bridge=br-ex (implied when not set).  This activates
legacy code which assumes that a single external network exists on
that bridge and the L3 Agent directly plugs itself in.
provider:network_type, provider:physical_network and
provider:segmentation_id are ignored.  You cannot create multiple
networks and you cannot use segmented networks (e.g. VLAN)

By setting external_network_bridge = (intentionally blank) the L2
Agent handles the configuration instead, this allows us to create
multiple networks and also to use more complex network configurations
such as VLAN.  It is also possible to use the same physical connection
with different segmentation IDs for both internal and external
networks, as well as multiple external networks.

Legacy/existing configurations where ext-port is set generate the same
configuration as previous and should continue to work as before.
Migration from legacy to new style configuration is not supported.

All network types (internal, external) are configured with bridge-mappings and data-port and the flat-network-providers configuration option of the neutron-api charm. Once deployed, you can configure the network specifics using neutron net-create. If the device name is not consistent between hosts, you can specify the same bridge multiple times with MAC addresses instead of interface names. The charm will loop through the list and configure the first matching interface. Basic configuration of a single external network, typically used as floating IP addresses combined with a GRE private network: neutron-openvswitch: bridge-mappings: physnet1:br-ex data-port: br-ex:eth1 neutron-api: flat-network-providers: physnet1 neutron net-create --provider:network_type flat \ --provider:physical_network physnet1 --router:external=true \ external neutron router-gateway-set provider external Alternative configuration with two networks, where the internal private network is directly connected to the gateway with public IP addresses but a floating IP address range is also offered. neutron-openvswitch: bridge-mappings: physnet1:br-data external:br-ex data-port: br-data:eth1 br-ex:eth2 neutron-api: flat-network-providers: physnet1 external Alternative configuration with two external networks, one for public instance addresses and one for floating IP addresses. Both networks are on the same physical network connection (but they might be on different VLANs, that is configured later using neutron net-create). neutron-openvswitch: bridge-mappings: physnet1:br-data data-port: br-data:eth1 neutron-api: flat-network-providers: physnet1 neutron net-create --provider:network_type vlan \ --provider:segmentation_id 400 \ --provider:physical_network physnet1 --shared external neutron net-create --provider:network_type vlan \ --provider:segmentation_id 401 \ --provider:physical_network physnet1 --shared --router:external=true \ floating neutron router-gateway-set provider floating This replaces the previous system of using ext-port, which always created a bridge called br-ex for external networks which was used implicitly by external router interfaces.

In some methods of UITestCase in functional tests base, the
timeout of ui.WebDriverWait was hardcoded, and it was impossible
to call them with some other (bigger) timeout if it's needed for

This patch adds ability to call them with custom timeout.

1. What is the problem
In test_plugin module, we define a stub class FakePlugin to
bypass real database access for unit tests. In some previous
test cases, FakePlugin object is directly created and then
we test its function, but after some changes in Neutron, we
also need to register the class path of FakePlugin to an

2. What is the solution to the problem
Register core_plugin for each test cases.

   to realize the solution
Register core_plugin in setUp function then every test cases

Previosly during delete_subnet in ml2 plugin ip allocation were removed
directly from database. This way ipam driver was unaware of this
deallocation.

Updated workflow to skip removing ip allocations directly from database.
Now ips are deallocated during update_port workflow (L1008).

This resolves issue with dhcp ports left in allocated state on ipam
provides side. Now they are correctly deallocated via update_port.

But this patch has next limitation: currently SLAAC allocations can
not be delete via update_port workflow, so ipam driver is still unaware
of such deallocations.
This part of issue is expected to be fixed as separate patch.

Subnet_in_use check was reworked. Previously it assumed that
auto-allocated ip are already deleted by the time of this check, but
with new workflow auto allocated ips are deleted later (on update_port).
So now this check verifies if there are any user allocated ips instead
of checking all allocations.

Mainly, remove Debian specific procedure from build tool.
Also, remove debconf content from Debian Install Guide,

cleanup at further following patches.

If we switch to using a retry and are more careful about handling errors
when a host is deleted or volumes are attached we don’t need to use the
lock.

For initialize_connection time when we go to create a host we run the
risk that a terminate_connection running in parallel deleted our host
from underneath us before the volume was attached. To handle that we
just catch the error in that scenario and try to create the host again.

The second issue for initialize_connection is if we try to create a host
and another initialize_connection running in parallel beats us to it. If
the host already exists we can catch the exception for create_host(..)
and retry, which will give us the existing one.

For terminate_connection time we run the risk that between when we
determine a host to be ready for deletion and actually deleting it a
new volume is attached. We can just swallow this error since the Purity
management API will not allow to delete a host with connected volumes.

Previously we were setting a whole model update, whereas now we only
do one value at a time. This will allow for easier handling of doing
the insert if not exist and reporting back what happened.

The older method to do this was better suited to the model_update from
initialize_connection, but we don’t need a ‘all-in-one’ kind of method
anymore.
