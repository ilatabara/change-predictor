Problem description =================== Currently Rally verification requires admin user for all tasks, even those that do not actually require an admin. All validators will accept user and admin credentials and sometimes use them, sometimes not. This produces a lot of issues: * a user with admin role is required even to run benchmarks that don't require admin role * rally can't be used for non-OpenStack benchmarking * there is no way to make validation per tenant (in case of existing users) Proposed change =============== There are several changes needed to implement this change. First is to remove the requirement for an admin user: * update schema for deployments to remove admin as a required element (only existing?) Remove ""admin"" attribute from the list of required elemenents. * update deployment code to handle ""admin"" as optional Secondly, we need a way to mark a task as ""requires-admin"" since there are tasks which can't be run unless provided an admin user. This could be done in several ways: 1. add a new attribute to the task to indicate that it requires a user with admin role, then add code in the validation to handle this new attribute. 2. let the user find out themselves when they try to use a function that requires admin role and it fails with an error indicating that the user is not authorized. The benefit of the former is that it makes it clear that the author of the scenario is aware that it needs an admin user. The benefit of the latter is that no code changes are required, and changes to a task don't require removal of the attribute. Implementation ============== Implementation details ---------------------- The implementation of the first part (making admin user optional) is straightforward. It requires updating schemas to make admin an optional element (currently it is required). The implementation of the second part (marking a task as requiring admin) is more interesting.

When defining a configuration, it's possible that the groups defined in
the openstack_user_config.yml file might not match those defined by the
env.d contents. This isn't strictly a problem - in most cases it's
ignored and will simply result in extra data. However, if keys in the
configuration and the environment are mismatched, it could result in
variable data not being mapped correctly in the resultant inventory.

This patchset extends the -c/--check parameter to compare the configured
groups against the environment's groups, and issue a warning if there is
a mismatch, which should help deployers diagnose some configuration
issues.

The warnings were not added to standard run operations due to the amount
of output generated on stdout by the JSON dump.

RabbitMQ nodes must all be stopped prior to a major/minor version
upgrade [1]. The role does this by distinguishing between the upgrader
node and the rest in separate stop and start tasks.

Upgrades can fail when more than one member of rabbitmq_all are not
members of the cluster. This is due to a bug fixed for greenfield
deployments by 5dc67955f0ac08a7c9719d641e9828558620da89. The same fix
was not applied to upgrades because major/minor upgrades require all
RabbitMQ nodes to be stopped which is incompatible with serialising the
role in isolation.

This change uses a play to stop all but one of the nodes, prior to
running the rabbitmq_server role, and then serialises the running of
the role so that one node is upgraded at a time. This minimises the
downtime as much as possible while allowing the role to be applied to
one node at a time.

- the testing is not automatic; it must be explicitly requested by
  leaving a 'check experimental' comment in Gerrit

- if the test fails for a particular change, it does not prevent that
  change from being merged; this is because we are not yet confident
  that the testing is always reliable

- the testing comprises a single Tempest test, 'test_server_basic_ops';
  we expect to expand this in further commits.

Some changes were needed to our DevStack plugin code, to allow it to
work in the OpenStack CI environment; all of these changes are also good
for the non-CI environments that we already test in.

- pip_install core Calico code instead of using git_clone.  (OpenStack
  CI jobs aren't allowed to use git clone.)

- Don't do a compute-only install when SERVICE_HOST is
  127.0.0.1.  (OpenStack CI sets SERVICE_HOST to 127.0.0.1.)

- Move 'disable_service tempest' and
  'NEUTRON_CREATE_INITIAL_NETWORKS=False' from plugin settings to the
  wider bootstrap script.  These settings are appropriate for a basic
  Calico demonstration (which is what the bootstrap script does) but
  _not_ for all possible uses of the networking-calico DevStack plugin,
  and specifically _not_ for how the plugin is used in OpenStack CI
  testing.

- Copy devstackgaterc file from networking-ovn, then modify so as only
  to run the 'test_server_basic_ops' test.

This commit also improves the doc about contributing, to recommend
'check experimental' and usage of the forums for discussing
networking-calico changes.

On the VPN Service Details page, there are a few labels that are
confusing and useless to the user.  This change proposes the
following fixes to improve the user experience on this page:

- To match the other fields, the ""Project ID"" value should be changed
to show the name of the project, as it is currently displaying the ID.
This value should also be a link to the details page of that project.
This will be way more useful to the user then just displaying the ID.
The ID alone is useless to the average user.  If they really want to
see the ID, that is what the details page is for.  Hence the need for
a quick link.

- All ""XXXXX ID"" labels should be changed to just ""XXXXX"".  That is,
""Project ID"" should be changed to ""Project"", ""Router ID"" to ""Router"",
and ""Subnet ID"" to ""Subnet"".  Being that the values of these label
fields are links to the entire details of that item, it makes more
sense to remove the ""ID"" and reference it as the whole item.

- In order to get the project details (i.e. project name), a keystone

to these details from being unexpectedly logged off upon clicking the
project name link, a policy check was set in place that basically
only implements the new code if the user does indeed have access to
these details.

This changeset addresses a particular L3-HA Neutron deployment scenario
in which the DNS server configured for the management network is not
also accessible from the virtual router namespace (i.e. over the
external network).
Keepalived uses the hostname against getaddrinfo twice to set default
values for the router_id and notification_email_from global configuration
attributes. If the hostname cannot be resolved through /etc/hosts and
if the nameserver is not reachable, long delays are incurred during
keepalived startup and configuration reload, causing VRRP state flapping
and dropped traffic over floating IPs.

Setting router_id and notification_email_from in the keepalived
configuration avoids unnecessary DNS lookups. However, this solution
is only effective with keepalived >= 1.2.17. Older versions still
exhibit the same problem with or without this patch.

Since the function already uses os.walk that will iterate through all
subdirectories for us, there is no need to recursively call the
function.

The recursive call was not just redundant, but also had another problem,
where we were passing relative paths to subdirectories, which made the
function to attempt importing modules that are not located under the
topdir. It could crash, or, worse, import a module that is
not under the expected parent directory.

This patch also modifies an existing unit test for the function to
validate that modules from subdirectories are also imported, even
without the recursive call.

Performance testing of an OSA deployed Swift cluster hit several issues.
Comparison of the proxy conf with the Swift Auth doc [1] found
two settings that affect performance that that were not set in the template.

include_service_catalog - This defaults to True which makes the proxy server
fetch the service catalog on every request in the authtoken middleware. This
hammers Keystone.

cache - When using memcache this should be set so the authtoken middleware
uses the correct cache and not go back to Keystone on every request.

Previously we did this with Pacemaker, but with move to NG HA
architecture we lost the ability to use NFS mounts as image storage for
Glance. This reimplements the mounting without utilizing Pacemaker. The
mount is by default also written to /etc/fstab so that it persists over

neutron should rely on nova doing the job instead of trying to 'fix' it.
'Fixing' it introduces race conditions between lb agent and nova VIF
driver. Particularly, lb agent can scan for new tap devices in the
middle of nova plumbing qbr-tap setup, and attempt to do it on its own.
So if agent is more lucky to plug the tap device into the bridge, nova
may fail to do the same, getting the following error:

libvirtError: Unable to add bridge brqxxx-xx port tapxxx-xx: Device or
resource busy

This also requires a change in how the port admin_state_up is implemented
by setting the tap device's link state instead of moving it in or out
of the bridge.

Also squashed in the following follow up fix:

lb: Correct String formatting to get rid of logged ValueError

The following error is caused by a missing String formatting in the
linuxbridge agent:
""ValueError: unsupported format character 'a' (0x61) at index 90
Logged from file linuxbridge_neutron_agent.py, line 447""

In addition a duplicated word in the log text has been fixed.

Also squashed in:

Only ensure admin state on ports that exist

The linux bridge agent was calling ensure_port_admin state
unconditionally on ports in treat_devices_added_or_updated.
This would cause it to throw an error on interfaces that
didn't exist so it would restart the entire processing loop.

If another port was being updated in the same loop before this
one, that port would experience a port status life-cycle of
DOWN->BUILD->ACTIVE->BUILD->ACTIVE
                   ^ <--- Exception in unrelated port causes cycle
                          to start over again.

This causes the bug below because the first active transition will
cause Nova to boot the VM. At this point tempest tests expect the
ports that belong to the VM to be in the ACTIVE state so it filters
Neutron port list calls with ""status=ACTIVE"". Therefore tempest would
not get any ports back and assume there was some kind of error with
the port and bail.

This patch just makes sure the admin state call is skipped if the port
doesn't exist and it includes a basic unit test to prevent a regression.

neutron should rely on nova doing the job instead of trying to 'fix' it.
'Fixing' it introduces race conditions between lb agent and nova VIF
driver. Particularly, lb agent can scan for new tap devices in the
middle of nova plumbing qbr-tap setup, and attempt to do it on its own.
So if agent is more lucky to plug the tap device into the bridge, nova
may fail to do the same, getting the following error:

libvirtError: Unable to add bridge brqxxx-xx port tapxxx-xx: Device or
resource busy

This also requires a change in how the port admin_state_up is implemented
by setting the tap device's link state instead of moving it in or out
of the bridge.

When pip_offline_install is used on a deployment such as an AIO where
the host being installed to ie. ""aio1"" is also the deployment host,
a race condition existed where the pip wheels would be downloaded,
uploaded to the same path on the target host, and then cleaned up
from the deployment host before the installation was continued.

The result is a race condition where the wheels are removed from
the target prior to installation due to the target being local.

This changes the pip offline install cleanup to run as a handler
so the cleanup can take place after the role has completed its work
with the cached wheels.

Sourcing of environment files is a bit different than running scripts,
because they are imported into the current environment.  That means
that if they are fiddling with ""set -x"" you can get odd things in the
output -- for example, if one environment file enables tracing then
all proceeding sourcing will have it on, but all the files sourced
before will not have output.  This is super confusing.

It's also very helpful to see how things are being expanded as they
set environment variables.

Thus I think the best idea is for environment files to leave tracing
alone and dib-run-parts can a) give a useful output about what file it
is sourcing and b) enable tracing around the import, then restore it
to the previous state afterwards.

Because environment files are sourced into the current environment,
they shouldn't be setting global settings like tracing else they
affect every preceeding import.  This is quite confusing when only
half your imports are traced in the logs, because it was either turned
on, or off, by a preceeding environment import.

There is a corresponding dib-run-parts change in
I29f7df1514aeb988222d1094e8269eddb485c2a0 that will greatly increase
debugability for environment files by deliberately logging what files
are sourced and consistently turning on tracing around their import.

This isn't strictly necessary (since dib-run-parts with the prior
change will just turn tracing off after import anyway) but it's a
decent cleanup for consistency.  A bare-minimum dib-lint check is
added.  Documentation is updated.

PyMySQL is prefered to PythonMySQL for Sqlalchemy, as it provides
python3 support and is actively maintained, and is therefore the
currently recommended lib for db connections.
 * http://docs.openstack.org/newton/install-guide-rdo/environment-sql-database.html

Kolla currently uses PyMySQL for all connections bar Barbican (which works fine
with PyMySQL), so this commit should have minimal impact outside of removing some
unrequired deps.

Currently cleanup interface has implicit flags destroy_disks and
destroy_vifs, and explicit flag 'delete instance service files', which
is calculated inside cleanup method using passed migrate_data parameter.

It does not look consistency and does not allow us to handle the files
deletion outside of migration flow, where migrate_data is not accesible.

This patch introduces straightforward delete_files flag into both
cleanup and destroy interfaces instead of migrate_data parameter.

Currently revert resize operation does not delete instance directory on
target host in case of shared block storage usage. The reason is that
the code does not distinguish between shared block storage and shared
instance path, asking to leave instance disks and directory in both
cases. As the result the second attempt to resize the instance to the
same host fails.

With this patch the code figures out both flags separately and uses them
to correct destroy the instance on the host.

The same change is added to _destroy_evacuated_instances method since it
potentially has the same problem.

Currently a volume backup can only be restored on the same Block
Storage service. This is because restoring a volume from a backup
requires metadata available on the remote database.

This proposal is to store backup metadata together
with the data, so a user will be able to restore a volume backup
on another Block Storage.

Put extra keys in both the root resource and in a properties dict.

Ensure data types are correct. Make sure int, float and bool values
are returned as int and bool.

Change disabled in flavor to is_disabled for consistency with other
bools we've added. There has been no release with the addition of disabled,
so changing it now is still safe.

Add locations and direct_url to images. They're optional in glance, but
that's evil.

Let image schema attribute fall through to extra properties.

Add zone to current_location.

Add readable mappings for power_state, task_state, vm_state, launched_at

Looking at the changes to the tests and seeing that the only change is
adding zone and properties into a couple of fixtures is a good place to
start.

Call to `format` or '%' (basically all string formating) can be
expensive and if someone is not interested in the logs produced
by shade (log_level set to error or higher) can be avoided.

Note: this change is a bit risky given the low unit test coverage.
But the longer we wait the harder this change will be.

In some cases, for instance, when updating from a non-SSL setup in
HAProxy to an SSL setup, we don't reload haproxy's configuration.
This is problematic since we need HAProxy to serve the certificates
and the new endpoints.

This forces the reload when puppet notices changes.

RabbitMQ nodes must all be stopped prior to a major/minor version
upgrade [1]. The role does this by distinguishing between the upgrader
node and the rest in separate stop and start tasks.

Upgrades can fail when more than one member of rabbitmq_all are not
members of the cluster. This is due to a bug fixed for greenfield
deployments by 5dc67955f0ac08a7c9719d641e9828558620da89. The same fix
was not applied to upgrades because major/minor upgrades require all
RabbitMQ nodes to be stopped which is incompatible with serialising the
role in isolation.

This change uses a play to stop all but one of the nodes, prior to
running the rabbitmq_server role, and then serialises the running of
the role so that one node is upgraded at a time. This minimises the
downtime as much as possible while allowing the role to be applied to
one node at a time.

Initially, neutron-server will fork multiple workers for API and RPC.
It loads mechanism drivers and all the resources after mechanism
driver initialization will be forked including network connections.
It will make the external SDN system unstable, bring races and finally
make it unstable or dead.

The PluginWorker and process notification has been proposed in neutron
in liberty [1]. It provides several ways to deal with the multi-process
and multi-thread in mechansim driver.

In dragonflow, we need to make sure the northbound database connection
is initialized after the neutron workers are forked. So we use process
notification here to initialize the connections.

Problem description =================== Current PCI pass-through whitelist address entry is defined as: [""address"": ""[[[[<domain>]:]<bus>]:][<slot>][.[<function>]]"", where the address uses the same syntax as it's in lspci or aggregated declaration of PCI devices by using '*'. Therefore there is no way to exclude specific VF(s) from the PCI pass-through whitelist address. Use Cases ---------- Deployer may want to exclude specific VF(s) to be used for other purposes. For instance VF can be used to connect compute node to storage node by running iSER (iSCSI Extensions for RDMA) transport. Proposed change =============== Enhance PCI pass-through whitelist to support regular expression syntax for address attributes. A new syntax will be introduced for the address key: ""address"":{ ""domain"": <domain>, ""bus"": <bus>, ""slot"": <slot>, \ ""function"": <function> } The traditional glob style will still be supported: ""address"": ""<domain>:<bus>:<slot>.<function>"" Example for the regular expression syntax: This allows allocation of VFs whose functions are from 2 upwards: pci_passthrough_whitelist= \ {""address"":{""domain"": "".*"", ""bus"": ""02"", ""slot"": ""01"", ""function"": ""[2-7]""}, \ ""physical_network"":""net1""} This allows allocation of VFs whose functions are from 2 downwards: pci_passthrough_whitelist= \ {""address"":{""domain"": "".*"", ""bus"": ""02"", ""slot"": ""01"", ""function"": ""[0-2]""}, \ ""physical_network"":""net1""} This allows allocation of VFs whose slots are between 1 and 2: pci_passthrough_whitelist= \ {""address"":{""domain"": "".*"", ""bus"": ""02"", ""slot"": ""0[1-2]"", ""function"": "".*""}, \ ""physical_network"":""net1""} Alternatives ------------ * Instead of whitelist regular expression we could add multiple PCI pass-through whitelist entries per host. These entries include all the VFs that can be used. This is already supported. * Instead of whitelist regular expression we could add PCI pass-through blacklist to sit alongside the whitelist to exclude specific PCI addresses.

Performance testing of an OSA deployed Swift cluster hit several issues.
Comparison of the proxy conf with the Swift Auth docu [1] found
two settings that affect performance that that were not set in the template.

include_service_catalog - This defaults to True which makes the proxy server
fetch the service catalog on every request in the authtoken middleware. This
hammers Keystone.

cache - When using memcache this should be set so the authtoken middleware
uses the correct cache and not go back to Keystone on every request.

heat_stack_user role definitely does not have
enough permission to manage a heat stack and can't
be used in tempest, this is an internal role for heat.

We should use the same role for heat_stack_owner as
for a regular user.

This change also adds the role set for the regular users.
This role set also should enable volume backup usage,
so the swiftoperator role will be used.

This optionally enables TLS for aodh in the internal network.
If internal TLS is enabled, each node that is serving the aodh
service will use certmonger to request its certificate.

This, in turn should also configure a command that should be ran when
the certificate is refreshed (which requires the service to be

The Ceilometer middleware is in the wrong place; actually any middleware
should be deployed after catch_errors to catch any errors that would
otherwise crash the proxy service. Additionally the ceilometer
middleware should be deployed after any authentication middleware.

Based on improved neutron ovsdb transaction, we can put two ovsdb commands
into to one transaction, when they have dependency on data structure.
Like, before we set port dhcp options for a port, or create a port with port
dhcp options, we need to insert the port dhcp options first, and get the
inserted UUID. And currently, we do these by separated transactions.

Separated transactions make orphan row can happen, and to clean orphan rows
related to ports left behind, we do full table scan to locate them, lose in
performance.

Since the patch will fix the orphan DHCP_Options row issue,
DelLSwitchPortCommand will be also enhanced to remove port dhcp options
referred by port within the same transaction.

Commit Iead5167210c4132badb866afc25d4ef14e27f6b2 introduces change
according which Swift resourses shouldn't been created if Ceph is
enabled. Swift user in Keystone database also shouldn't been created
in this case. That's why decreasing of keystone_user count is needed
in check_oswl_stat method.

This patch brings some hacking checkes from nova and cinder,
to detect some undesiable usage like assertEqual(None, A) in
pep8 testing.

This patch also fixes some python3 compatibility issues which
I found when I added these hacking rules.

Although SECURE_DELETE was correctly handled in lib/cinder, that

But the `volume_clear` config option must be set on a per backend

The patch adds the notification support and introduces a poll

* For the generic host based migration, the position indication of
/proc/<PID>/fdinfo/1 can be retrieved to indicate how many bytes
have been copied. LVM is taken as the reference to implement.

* For the driver specific migration, the back-end driver needs to
report a capability telling the manager if it supports to report the
migration progress. Please implement the method get_migration_progress

* For the file based migration, the voluem trasfer is implemented
in Patch Iece2776fa751152f97b389ddab426e50c6f79bea for the
RBD driver. The transfer percentage is calculated by the
relative position of the file handler over the volume size.

The migration progress can be checked via the cinderclient, and the
progress information can be found in the c-vol log, where the source
volume is located. The information is logged as
""The source volume XXXX has been copied ### percent"".

migration abortion for available volumes

If the admin is migrating a volume without locking the volume,
this migration can be aborted by the volume user's actions, e.g.
extend, attach, delete, etc. This patch targets to abort the
host assisted migration across different volume nodes.
