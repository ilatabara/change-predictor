Note that the tripleo::firewall::rule class is kept because this class
is still used by the tripleo::masquerade_networks class.

It also take into account overcloud that doesn't have an Controller

https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tripleo-common/+/800580 adds
the support of building containers on CentOS Stream 9.

mariadb>10.5 does not works with
/usr/share/openstack-tripleo-common-containers/container-images/kolla/mariadb/security_reset.expect
file. It needs
https://opendev.org/openstack/kolla/src/branch/master/docker/mariadb/mariadb-server/security_reset.expect.debian
to be placed with in kolla/mariadb directly so that it
will work with mariadb>10.5.

The file is renamed to security_reset.expect.10.5 to
avoid debian in the end.

Since above filepath is hardcoded in the mariadb
container so putting it in c9 container build
patch is not working.
So we are moving it to a seperate patch.

Nova used so called runway slots for multiple cycles. There was 3 slots, each can be filled with a patch series ready for review for two weeks at a time. We assumed that cores are focusing on reviewing the series while it is in the slot. We also assumed that the patch author is available and quickly fixing feedback while the series is in the slot. Meanwhile other patches waited in a FIFO queue for a free slot. Our experience was: 1) It only worked if somebody kept the state of the queue and the slots up to date in the etherpad. So it needed a central authority to manage the process. This did not scale well. 2) It was as effective as we, cores, are kept it honest and allocated our review time on the patches in the slots. Such commitment is hard to get or follow up on without being aggressive. So the aim of the new review priority process is to be as decentralized amongst cores as possible. We trust cores that when they mark something as priority then they also themselves commit to review the patch. We also assume that if a core reviewed a patch then that core should easily find another core as a second reviewer when needed. Note that this process does not want to change how a patch is discovered to be ready for review. The patch authors free to you any existing forums and ways to get review attention. Therefore we use the Review-Priority label in Gerrit in the following way: * Review-Priority is a label with 0 or +1 values, that can be set by the members of the core team * A core sets the Review-Priority flag to +1 to indicate that they will help the author to get the patch merged. * We expect that the cores will limit the number of patches marked with +1 Review-Priority based on their actual review bandwidth * We expect that cores will check the list of reviews already having Review-Priority +1 set by other cores before they mark a new one as such to see where they can help first by being the second core. * There will be a regular agenda point on the weekly meeting where the team look at the list of patches with +1 mark to keep an overall view what is happening in nova. Pros: * Decentralized * Each core is responsible of its own commitments * Review priority information is kept close to the review system Cons: * No externally enforced time limit on patches sitting idle with +1 Review-Priority * No externally enforced limit on how many things can be a priority at any given time. * Does not (want to) solve the problem of discovering reviews that are ready to core review ",,68,0

A series of enhancements can be performed in the share server
migration operation, and share backends might support
nondisruptive share server migrations, which was not covered
in the previous approach.

-  Skip the destination share server network allocation if the
driver is capable of reusing the source share server allocation.
Manila will switch the allocations in the migration complete phase.

- Allow share backends to reuse the share servers in case they
are able to do so in a share server migration scenario.

- Nondisruptive migration is now feasible depending on whether the
share driver supports it and if the share network parameters have
not changed.

- Share servers will be always deleted whe the share server
migration complete operation is finished.

The quota_packet_filter parameter is no longer used in core neutron.
The parameter was used by NEC OpenFlow plugin but the plugin was
migrated to an independent repository[1][2].

Currently puppet-neutron doesn't support the plugin so the parameter
is no longer used in a deployment managed by puppet-neutron.

Because we haven't seen any interest in adding support for the plugin
and the plugin itself has not been updated for a while, let's deprecate
the useless parameter so that we can remove it in the next cycle.

This is required for libvirtd with cgroupsv2 (Debian Bullseye and
soon others).
Otherwise, device attachments simply fail.
The warning message suggests filtering will be disabled but it
actually just fails the action entirely.

new mechanism provided by ONTAP, when both source and destination
clusters have versions >= 9.10. This new migration mechanism
supports nondisruptive migrations in case there aren't network
changes in the migration.

- The NetApp now does not need to create an actual share server in
the backend prior to the migration, in case SVM Migrate is being
used.

- The NetApp ONTAP driver can now reuse network allocations from
the source share server in case a share network change wasn't
identified.

- map disks to `Storage`, not `StorageControllersListField`
to have access to `Storage` fields, including
`identity` and possibly `storage_controllers`
- durable_name is not present on all controllers,
for example, BOSS-S1
- in known supported BMC, iDRAC, in target RAID config

This new parameter takes key=value format, and can be passed multiple
times.

Those key/values can then be used within the image description files in
order to make them support different releases, or just use the value in
case we have a specific version (python-version for instance).

This will be useful in order to support container builds on both CS8 and
CS9 releases without too many duplications or headaches.

Note that a ""tcib_"" prefix is enforced for the keys.

Now that the whole-disk image is being deployed, mounting an image
using tools like kpartx or qemu-nbd is much more involved, requiring
knowledge of the image LVM volumes and their intended mount points.

The scripts tripleo-mount-image and tripleo-unmount-image will mount
the contents of an overcloud image file using qemu-nbd, making it available
for chroot, or other read/write image operations. The scripts handle
partition images (overcloud-full.qcow2) as well as the whole-disk image
(overcloud-hardened-uefi-full.qcow2) with its multiple LVM volume mount
points.

qemu-nbd was chosen over kpartx as downstream documentation[1] has
standardized on this tool for mount based image modifications.

tripleo-unmount-image is a symlink to tripleo-mount-image and behaves
differently based on the script name.

The general use case of libvirt's compareCPU() API is to allow comparing
a guest CPU to a host CPU. However, for AArch64, the _only_ use case
libvirt supports is to allow comparing host CPU with a destination CPU
which is accomplished with the help of this patch[1].

So what we're talking about here, in context of AArch64, is comparing
source _host_ CPU to destination _host_ CPU, so as to prevent a guest
from migrating to a completely different host. For AArch64, in the
past we skipped[2] _guest_ CPU to host CPU comparison (the
""traditional"" use case) check for AArch64 for two main reasons, and
these reasons are still valid:
1. There are lots of vendors making different AArch64 CPUs, and they
   are all not easily comparable because they all differ in various
   ways.
2. QEMU AArch64 developers themselves recommend that using 'host-
   passthrough' is  the way to run KVM guests on AArch64.

In sum, for AArch64, (a) guests should use 'host-passthrough';
and (b) src host to dest host CPU comparison only makes sense to
know about _host_ CPU compatibility, but you will not get any CPU

This change removes the following configurations currently unused in
the cluster managed by Pacemaker

- Replication is automatically declared by the redis resource agent.
  Thus there is no need to declare the ""slaveof"" parameter in
  redis.conf.

- Sentinel is the software to implement clustering but it is unused
  in a cluster managed by the redis resource agent currently used.

The ControllerAgent class now changes in Openstack when changing the
type of an agent in its ovsdb table. This is possible thanks to adding a
new condition to the event that triggered the update of the AgentCache.
If the right external_ids changed, a new agent with the correct class

This reverts commit 810417df865c7b4eb71cee4dfee843d65972852b.

The Swift driver not being able to use Trusts had nothing to do
about the store driver itself nor that keystoneauth1 would have
broken the feature, but rather it not having the functionality
in the first place and us not catching that on reviews.

We should figure out how to test this before we try to replace
this code again.

The Ceph Dashboard uses by default the Grafana network to bind the
overcloud backends to the specified port.
However, the CephDashboardNetwork parameter is used to define the
haproxy frontend and the related vip, used to reach the Ceph backends.
The purpose of this patch is to make sure the right defaults are
used for TripleO deployed Ceph clusters.

config while creating connector object

Currently we only pass the configured multipath option when getting
the connector properties and do not pass it when creating the
connector object which in turn does the multipathing in os-brick.
So we are only passing multipathing option to cinder for exporting &
mapping the volume to paths but not while creating the connector object
and hence doing multipathing partially.
This patch passes that option and fixes the stated issue.

L3 router will set its devices link up by default.
For HA routers, the gateway device will be pluged
in all scheduled hosts. When the gateway deivce is
up in backup node, it will send out IPv6 related
packets (MLDv2) according to some kernal config.
This will cause the physical fabric think that the
gateway MAC is now working in the backup node. And
finally the master node L3 traffic will be broken.

This patch sets the backup gateway device link down
by default. When the VRRP sets the master state in
one host, the L3 agent state change procedure will
do link up action for the gateway device.

Venus is a unified log management module, according to the
keyrequirements of OpenStack in log storage, retrieval, analysis
and so on. This module can provide a one-stop solution to log
collection, cleaning, indexing, analysis, alarm, visualization,
report generation etc..

Venus can help operator or maintainer to improve the level of
platform management and the goal of the project is to make log
retrieval no longer difficult, to make log typical error warnings
become a reality.

Venus project has been contributed to OpenStack Community in November
2020. At that time, functions such as collection, retrieval, and error
statistics of platform log and service log  were developed. In order to
make the venus project easier and more practical, the functions of venus
have been enriched and improved in the past six monthsas follows:
1. Improved and standardized the completed code, added some test codes[1].
2. Venus-dashboard plug-in [2] based on Horizon is developed, which can

Optional. Default: not enabled. ``key_file=PATH`` Path to the private key file the server should use when binding to an SSL-wrapped socket. Optional. Default: not enabled. ``ca_file=PATH`` Path to the CA certificate file the server should use to validate client certificates provided during an SSL handshake. This is ignored if ``cert_file`` and ''key_file`` are not set. Optional. Default: not enabled. Configuring Registry Access ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ There are a number of configuration options in Glance that control how the API server accesses the registry server. .. include:: ../deprecate-registry.inc ``registry_client_protocol=PROTOCOL`` If you run a secure Registry server, you need to set this value to ``https`` and also set ``registry_client_key_file`` and optionally ``registry_client_cert_file``. Optional. Default: http ``registry_client_key_file=PATH`` The path to the key file to use in SSL connections to the registry server, if any. Alternately, you may set the ``GLANCE_CLIENT_KEY_FILE`` environ variable to a filepath of the key file Optional. Default: Not set. ``registry_client_cert_file=PATH`` Optional. Default: Not set. The path to the cert file to use in SSL connections to the registry server, if any. Alternately, you may set the ``GLANCE_CLIENT_CERT_FILE`` environ variable to a filepath of the cert file ``registry_client_ca_file=PATH`` Optional. Default: Not set. The path to a Certifying Authority's cert file to use in SSL connections to the registry server, if any. Alternately, you may set the ``GLANCE_CLIENT_CA_FILE`` environ variable to a filepath of the CA cert file ``registry_client_insecure=False`` Optional. Default: False. When using SSL in connections to the registry server, do not require validation via a certifying authority. This is the registry's equivalent of specifying --insecure on the command line using glanceclient for the API ``registry_client_timeout=SECONDS`` Optional. Default: ``600``. The period of time, in seconds, that the API server will wait for a registry request to complete. A value of '0' implies no timeout. .. note:: ``use_user_token``, ``admin_user``, ``admin_password``, ``admin_tenant_name``, ``auth_url``, ``auth_strategy`` and ``auth_region`` options were considered harmful and have been deprecated in M release. They will be removed in O release. For more information read `OSSN-0060 <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0060>`_. Related functionality with uploading big images has been implemented with Keystone trusts support. ``use_user_token=True`` Optional. Default: True DEPRECATED. This option will be removed in O release. Pass the user token through for API requests to the registry. If 'use_user_token' is not in effect then admin credentials can be specified (see below). If admin credentials are specified then they are used to generate a token; this token rather than the original user's token is used for requests to the registry. ``admin_user=USER`` DEPRECATED. This option will be removed in O release. If 'use_user_token' is not in effect then admin credentials can be specified. Use this parameter to specify the username. Optional. Default: None ``admin_password=PASSWORD`` DEPRECATED. This option will be removed in O release. If 'use_user_token' is not in effect then admin credentials can be specified. Use this parameter to specify the password. Optional. Default: None ``admin_tenant_name=TENANTNAME`` DEPRECATED. This option will be removed in O release. If 'use_user_token' is not in effect then admin credentials can be specified. Use this parameter to specify the tenant name. Optional. Default: None ``auth_url=URL`` DEPRECATED. This option will be removed in O release. If 'use_user_token' is not in effect then admin credentials can be specified. Use this parameter to specify the Keystone endpoint. Optional.

Use this parameter to specify the auth strategy. Optional. Default: noauth ``auth_region=REGION`` DEPRECATED. This option will be removed in O release.

Passing newline to the dnsmasq may cause security issues, especially
that in case of Neutron that dhcp options' values are controlled by
cloud users.
This patch removes everything what is after first newline character

We've been using old cirros-0.4.0 for long time, and don't need to fix
the version of cirros to 0.4.0. This patch is update to the latest
0.5.2.

Most of the changes in this patch is replacing `image`, `hash` and
`version` in TOSCA definition files. The rest of them are:

* Replace images. First one is only an actual image, and rest of them
  are empty text files which is a trick for reducing total size in
  tacker repo. So, text files are not replaced, but renamed simply.

  * tacker/tests/etc/samples/sample_vnf_package_csar_in_meta_and_manifest/Files/images/cirros-0.5.2-x86_64-disk.img

* Update functional tests verifying images. A refactor of defining
  package size is included.

* Update devstack script, and helper scripts under `contrib` dir.

* Update API references and documents describing usage of the image.

With ephemeral heat we lost the meaning of the 'stack_action' hiera key
which we previously used to distinguish between fresh deployment and
pre-existing deployment (aka redeploy).
Since this hiera key is not available anymore, in ansible we added a
TRIPLEO_HA_WRAPPER_RESOURCE_EXISTS env variable which will be true
when the resource existed even before calling puppet.

This way we can restore the previous behaviour (which was relying
on the stack_update hiera key) of restarting an HA
bundle on the bootstrap node in case of a configuration change.

While we're at it we make sure that the logging takes place via logger
so we're sure to capture these events in the journal.

Tested as follows:
1) Initial deploy:

The legacy directory can exist, but the validations don't have to be there.
In such a case, the legacy directory would still be used by VF,
instead of the new directory containing validation playbooks.

This patch reverses the condition, so that the client first
attempts to use the new validations playbook directory,
and only if it doesn't exist falls back to the legacy one.

A new BasePolicyTest class (heavily borrowed from nova) provides
machinery for verifying policies against a list of contexts for which
an action should be authorized, and then again against a list
of contexts for which the action should be unauthorized. The set of
contexts map to the OpenStack RBAC personas.

Cinder's context.authorize() function is updated to ensure the correct

A unit test utility function ""attach_volume"" is fixed to correctly
use an elevated context when creating an attachment DB entry.

The change [1] syncs the charmhelpers that has additional
context data to IdentityServiceContext - internal_host,
internal_port, internal_protocol.

This patch adds the internal_host, internal_port,
internal_protocol to neutron-plugin-api relation data.
Without this patch, any relations over neutron-plugin-api
will be incomplete if the charm holding the other end of
the relation has charmhelpers synced.

The ability to specify `access rules <http://specs.openstack .org/openstack/keystone-specs/specs/keystone/stein/capabilities-app-creds .html>`_ for application credentials has been implemented in the Train cycle. The goal of this story is to add application credentials support in *monasca-agent*. This will prevent the security risk of revealing OpenStack user's password when installing the agent on the tenants environment. The access rules of these application credentials should be limited to posting measurements. *monasca-setup* should be extended to automatically generate such credentials and save them in configuration file if needed. Similar task should be implemented in *monasca-grafana-datasource*. Stories: * https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2005622 * https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2005623 ",,88,0

Passing newline to the dnsmasq may cause security issues, especially
that in case of Neutron that dhcp options' values are controlled by
cloud users.
This patch removes everything what is after first newline character

Add a new # public string at the bottom if you need one. # General observations # # - This file uses the three ""default roles"" provided by the default Keystone # installation. These are 'admin', 'member', and 'reader'. # # - The default Keystone installation implements an inheritance relation # between the roles: # 'admin' is-a 'member' is-a 'reader' # More importantly, however, Keystone will actually populate the credentials # appropriately. Thus, someone with the 'admin' role on project X will also # have the 'member' and 'reader' roles on project X. What this means for # us is that if we have a policy we want satisfied by someone with any of # the 'admin', 'member', or 'reader' roles, we do NOT need to do this: # ""get-foo-policy"": ""role:admin or role:member or role:reader"" # Instead we can simply say: # ""get-foo-policy"": ""role:reader"" # because we know that anyone who has been assigned the 'admin' role in # Keystone also has the 'member' and 'reader' roles, and anyone assigned # the 'member' role *also* has the 'reader' role. # # - How do I know what string to use? # Cinder maintains a policy matrix correlating REST API calls, policy # names, and what ""personas"" can perform them. The ""personas"" are # abstract entities whose powers are supposed to be consistent across # OpenStack services. The ""personas"" are implemented by each service # using the default Keystone roles and scopes ... but you have to be # careful, because for example, a ""system-reader"" persona is NOT simply # a read-only administrator (it's actually less). See the policy matrix # for details. # # - This is probably obvious, but I'll say it anyway. There is nothing # magic about the 'reader' role that guarantees that someone with *only* # that role can only do read-only kind of stuff in a service. We (as the # Cinder service team) give it meaning by the way we define our policy # rules. So if as a joke, we were to write rules that allowed someone # with only the 'reader' role to delete volumes in any project, there is # nothing Keystone could do about it. So be careful. # Generic policy check string for the persona we are calling 'system-admin'. # Note: we aren't recognizing system scope in Xena, so we aren't actually # using this check string yet. _SYSTEM_ADMIN = 'role:admin and system_scope:all' _LEGACY_SYSTEM_ADMIN = 'role:admin' # Cinder doesn't plan to use this one.

When there is an unpinned dependency in requirements file, then
pip uses pip-resolver to pull multiple version of a package
which takes time and it leads to Job TimeOut.

In order to avoid that, let'use pip-compile to generate the
dependencies and use the same in the testenv

The Ceph Dashboard uses by default the Grafana network to bind the
overcloud backends to the specified port.
However, the CephDashboardNetwork parameter is used to define the
haproxy frontend and the related vip, used to reach the Ceph backends.
The purpose of this patch is to make sure the right defaults are
used for TripleO deployed Ceph clusters.

This patch adds support to revert to snapshot for NFS, FC and
iSCSI drivers with FlexVol pool.

Adds a method on client_cmode to rename a NFS volume file using
the file-rename-file zapi call.

The revert steps are:
  1. Create a clone volume file/LUN from snapshot.
  2. Change the original volume file/LUN path to a temporary path.
  3. Change clone file/LUN path to the original path.
  4. Delete the volume file/LUN on temporary path.

If any step fails, the original volume file/LUN is preserved and
the clone file/LUN is deleted.

For NFS, ONTAP clone file is not supported on FlexGroup pool, in
this case the generic implementation will perform the revert to
snapshot.

With ephemeral heat we lost the meaning of the 'stack_action' hiera key
which we previously used to distinguish between fresh deployment and
pre-existing deployment (aka redeploy).
Since this hiera key is not available anymore, we simply check if the
resource existed before running puppet. If it did not, we're part of
an initial deployment, if it did exist then this is a redeploy and
in such case, if the config changed we will restart the service on
the bootstrap node.

We also cleanup the molecule steps as there are some redundancies there.

Testing protocol is in the parent change.

The upper constraints of the python dependencies were previously
set to the master as well as to the wallaby branch.

As there is a growing possibility of conflict between them,
it is preferrable to keep only one, branch accurate, version
of the constraints.

Furthermore the installation directive of the tox environment
is unnecessary, as the the dependencies can be specified
separately and pulled during environment setup.

The following volume type extra specs are now visible to regular
users (non-administrators):
- RESKEY:availability_zones
- multiattach
- replication_enabled

The list is defined in the code, and is not configurable.

Regular users may view these user visible specs, and use them as a
filter when listing volume types, but access is essentially read-only.
Only cloud administrators are authorized to create or modify extra
specs, including the user visible ones.

The feature works by relaxing a few policies that were previously
admin-only, and adds a new volume_extension:types_extra_specs:read_sensitive
policy that limits access to all other (non-user visible) specs so
that only cloud administrators can see them.

This feature provides regular users with more information about the volume types available to them, and lets them make more informed decisions on which volume type to choose when creating volumes. The following ``extra spec`` keys are treated as user visible: - ``RESKEY:availability_zones`` - ``multiattach`` - ``replication_enabled`` .. note:: * The set of user visible ``extra specs`` is a fixed list that is not configurable. * The feature is entirely policy based, and does not require a new microversion. Behavior using openstack client ------------------------------- Consider the following volume type, as viewed from an administrator's perspective. In this example, ``multiattach`` is a user visible ``extra spec`` and ``volume_backend_name`` is not. .. code-block:: console # Administrator behavior [admin@host]$ openstack volume type show vol_type +--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+ | Field | Value | +--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+ | access_project_ids | None | | description | None | | id | d03a0f33-e695-4f5c-b712-7d92abbf72be | | is_public | True | | name | vol_type | | properties | multiattach='<is> True', volume_backend_name='secret' | | qos_specs_id | None | +--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+ Here is the output when a regular user executes the same command.

Regular users are able to use that feature to filter for user visible ``extra specs``. If a regular user attempts to filter on a non-user visible ``extra spec`` then an empty list is returned. .. code-block:: console # Administrator behavior [admin@host]$ cinder --os-volume-api-version 3.52 type-list \ > --filters extra_specs={""multiattach"":""<is> True""} +--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-----------+ | ID | Name | Description | Is_Public | +--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-----------+ | d03a0f33-e695-4f5c-b712-7d92abbf72be | vol_type | - | True | +--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-----------+ [admin@host]$ cinder --os-volume-api-version 3.52 type-list \ > --filters extra_specs={""volume_backend_name"":""secret""} +--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-----------+ | ID | Name | Description | Is_Public | +--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-----------+ | d03a0f33-e695-4f5c-b712-7d92abbf72be | vol_type | - | True | +--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-----------+ # Regular user behavior [user@host]$ cinder --os-volume-api-version 3.52 type-list \ > --filters extra_specs={""multiattach"":""<is> True""} +--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-----------+ | ID | Name | Description | Is_Public | +--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-----------+ | d03a0f33-e695-4f5c-b712-7d92abbf72be | vol_type | - | True | +--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-----------+ [user@host]$ cinder --os-volume-api-version 3.52 type-list \ > --filters extra_specs={""volume_backend_name"":""secret""} +----+------+-------------+-----------+ | ID | Name | Description | Is_Public | +----+------+-------------+-----------+ +----+------+-------------+-----------+ Security considerations ----------------------- Cloud administrators who do not wish to expose any ``extra specs`` to regular users may restore the previous behavior by setting the following policies to their pre-Xena default values. .. code-block:: console ""volume_extension:access_types_extra_specs"": ""rule:admin_api"" ""volume_extension:types_extra_specs:index"": ""rule:admin_api"" ""volume_extension:types_extra_specs:show"": ""rule:admin_api"" To restrict regular users from using ``extra specs`` to filter the list of volume types, modify /etc/cinder/resource_filters.json to restore the *""volume_type""* entry to its pre-Xena default value. .. code-block:: console ""volume_type"": [""is_public""] ",,359,261

1. Remove the unnecessary requirements
2. Keeping going with docs

Sphinx 1.8 introduced [1] the '--keep-going' argument which, as its name
suggests, keeps the build running when it encounters non-fatal errors.
This is exceptionally useful in avoiding a continuous edit-build loop
when undertaking large doc reworks where multiple errors may be
introduced.

By default, we don't currently allow the Nova microversion
header for CORS requests.  It should be something that is
included out of the box because it's part of the core API.

By default, we don't currently allow the Nova microversion
header for CORS requests.  It should be something that is
included out of the box because it's part of the core API.

Deployers can workaround this by overriding allow_headers,
but we should provide a better experience out of the box.

I’ve been involved in OpenStack since around 2014, got involved with Puppet OpenStack in 2016, has been a core reviewer since 2018 and also held the PTL position for the Stein cycle. The Puppet OpenStack project is in a very mature state, the majority of our work is staying up-to-date with the constant changes to configuration options and general deployment topology changes but the interface itself is considered very stable and we have a very rigorous stable backport policy that helps us. We have a lot of major work done the last cycles, moving to CentOS 8, moving to CentOS Stream, adding support for Puppet 7 etc. We’ve also seen a major amount of cleanup and fixes to the policy (JSON to YAML) code (thanks Takashi!). The Puppet OpenStack team is limited and we therefore don’t hold any meetings and instead rely on the #puppet-openstack IRC channel for communications (come and say hello!). Best regards Tobias Urdin, Binero ",,20,0

I8b1c05317734e14ea73dc868941351bb31210bf0 introduced a crude call to
_cleanup_volumes within _do_build_and_run_instance when handling a
RescheduledException exception raised from _build_and_run_instance
without any retry information provided from the scheduler.

This situation can arise when using the 'availability_zone' parameter to
skip the scheduler by providing both a target availability_zone and host
in the format of `$availability_zone:$host`. If the instance is unable
to build on the compute the failure will eventually lead to
_cleanup_volumes calling DriverVolumeBlockDevice.detach that will either
detach (cinderv2) or delete the associated volume attachments (cinderv3)
moving the volume to an `available` state, assuming it isn't
multi-attached etc.

The issue with this is that this behaviour is in stark contrast to that
of volumes associated with instances that have failed to schedule. In
that case the volumes remain marked as reserved and associated with the
ERROR'd out instance until the instance itself is deleted.

This change aims to align both cases by removing the call to
_cleanup_volumes and in doing so keeping any volumes in a `reserved`
state until the underlying instance is deleted.

Note that leaving these volumes associated with ERROR'd out instances is
now safe after I4dc6c8bd3bb6c135f8a698af41f5d0e026c39117 landed and now
ensures that ports and volumes associated with such an instance are
correctly cleaned up.

NOTE(lyarwood): Test conflict as Idb9a0c06d8abdb158bcee5be12c35dcb67257e60
landed on stable/victoria removing hooks from Nova and an associated
mock from test_rescheduled_exception_without_retry.

With ephemeral heat we lost the meaning of the 'stack_action' hiera key
which we previously used to distinguish between fresh deployment and
pre-existing deployment (aka redeploy).
Since this hiera key is not available anymore, in ansible we added a
TRIPLEO_HA_WRAPPER_RESOURCE_EXISTS env variable which will be true
when the resource existed even before calling puppet.

This way we can restore the previous behaviour (which was relying
on the stack_update hiera key) of restarting an HA
bundle on the bootstrap node in case of a configuration change.

While we're at it we make sure that the logging takes place via logger
so we're sure to capture these events in the journal.

Tested as follows:
1) Initial deploy:

When dlrn_url is overridden it is being ignored and instead the
default is used. This makes it that the passed config is honored.

Adds molecule test case to check vanilla invocation and test
that passed dlrn_url is honored - test cases brought from WIP

With ephemeral heat we lost the meaning of the 'stack_action' hiera key
which we previously used to distinguish between fresh deployment and
pre-existing deployment (aka redeploy).
Since this hiera key is not available anymore, we simply check if the
resource existed before running puppet. If it did not, we're part of
an initial deployment, if it did exist then this is a redeploy and
in such case, if the config changed we will restart the service on
the bootstrap node.

We also cleanup the molecule steps as there are some redundancies there.

Testing protocol is in the parent change.

When dlrn_url is overridden it is being ignored and instead the
default is used. This makes it that the passed config is honored.

Adds molecule test case to check vanilla invocation and test
that passed dlrn_url is honored - test cases brought from WIP
patch in [1].

It seems that using default singleton=True in the
routes.middleware.RoutesMiddleware which is leading to use thread-local
RequestConfig singleton object is not working well with eventlet
monkeypatching of threading library which we are doing in Neutron.
As a result it leaks memory in neutron-api workers every time when API
request to not existing API endpoint is made by user.

To avoid that memory leak, let's use singletone=False in that
RoutesMiddleware object, at least until problem with thread-local

In the ONTAP 9.8 and older, there is a bug in the zapi call
`snapmirror-release-iter` when using the scoped account
configuration. The operation is returning success, but the release
is not occurring.

To avoid this issue, the Netapp driver was changed to release with
the `snapmirror-release` zapi call, instead of the one that has a
bug. This new zapi call requires the field `relationship-id` to be
specified and it is being retrieved from ONTAP before calling it.

A small fix, not related to the bug, was made in the zapi call to
`snapmirror-release-iter` because the `relationship-info-only`
field was in the wrong place according to the documentation.

The Cinder community agreed to do detailed rechecks and try to avoid

Sometimes it is hard to remember what the agreement was, what is the
recommended format, and what was the reason behind it.

This patch adds a brief explanation to the contributor documentation to

And the list goes on and on. When we detect one of these cases the normal procedure is to run a recheck writing a comment with ``recheck`` for core Zuul jobs, or the specific third party CI recheck command, for example ``run-DellEMC PowerStore CI``. These false negative have periods of time where they spike, for example when there are spurious failures, and a lot of rechecks are necessary until a valid result is posted by the CI job. And it's in these periods of time where people acquire the tendency to blindly issue rechecks without locking at the errors reported by the jobs. When these blind checks happen on real patch failures or with external services that are going to be out for a while, they lead to wasted resources as well as longer result times for patches in other projects. The Cinder community has noticed this tendency and wants to fix it, so now it is strongly encouraged to avoid issuing naked rechecks and instead issue them with additional information to indicate that we have looked at the failure and confirmed it is unrelated to the patch. Here are some real examples of proper rechecks: - Spurious issue in other component: ``recheck tempest-integrated-storage : intermittent failure nova bug #1836754`` - Deployment issue on the job: ``recheck cinder-plugin-ceph-tempest timed out, errors all over the place`` - External service failure: ``Third party recheck grenade : Failed to retrieve .deb packages`` Another common case for blindly rechecking a patch is when it is only changing a specific driver but there are failures on jobs that don't use that driver. In such cases we still have to look at the failures, because they can be failures that are going to take a while to fix, and issuing a recheck will be futile at that time and we should wait for a couple of hours, or maybe even a day, before issuing a recheck that can yield the desired result.

It seems that using default singleton=True in the
routes.middleware.RoutesMiddleware which is leading to use thread-local
RequestConfig singleton object is not working well with eventlet
monkeypatching of threading library which we are doing in Neutron.
As a result it leaks memory in neutron-api workers every time when API
request to not existing API endpoint is made by user.

To avoid that memory leak, let's use singletone=False in that
RoutesMiddleware object, at least until problem with thread-local
singleton and eventlet monkey patching will be solved.

API microversions are inhertied in nature from features points
of view, means higher microversion will have all the features/
changes done in lower microversion.

In Tempest we write the microversion tests by capping
the min and max microversion so that they can request
the API with correct microversion.

But for non microversion tests we do not test if they are
run-able for all the configured microversion in Tempest config
file. To test it at some extend this commit adds a experimental
job to run the API tests (compute and volume) with 'latest'
microversion to know if that run successfully or need modification.

This job is experimental as now as I expect lot of test failure
with the 'latest' microversion and as we keep fixing those and all
the tests pass then we can move it to voting job in check/gate pipeline.

The correct export of the stack parameters no longer depends
on order of the tripleclient.constants.EXPORT_DATA,
as the lack of expected json file with parameters to export
raises exception, rather than filling the requested key with
data obtained in the previous iteration.

The I/O logic was moved to the tripleoclient.utils to keep
things more consistent.

No longer necessary json import was removed.

Tests were adjusted to mock more selectively.

Glance has recently added distributed image import support where
a new parameter 'worker_self_reference_url' has been added by which
other workers will get to know how to contact the worker which has
staged the image.

In this patch, adding configuration of 'worker_self_reference_url'
by providing it the internal API URL for each node where glance api
will run when glance-direct method of image-import is enabled.

It seems that using default singleton=True in the

RequestConfig singleton object is not working well with eventlet
monkeypatching of threading library which we are doing in Neutron.
As a result it leaks memory in neutron-api workers every time when API

To avoid that memory leak, let's use singletone=False in that

In FIPS mode, using RSA keys for ssh is fine as long as SHA-1 is
not used for the signature algorithm.  Unfortunately, the version
of cirros used in OpenStack CI does not have a version of dropbear
that supports SHA-2 signatures.  So, any connections from a FIPS
enabled machine will fail as the cirros instance will only support
ssh-rsa (SHA-1 signatures).

To get around this, we add a new option to specify the key type
(validation.ssh_key_type).  This will allow the addition of other
key types in future if needed.

Temporarily try adding patched paramiko.

Initially the idea was to have for each cell export information
for the additional cell to deploy. The name of the new cell
is provided to the export command to create the export file
name, if not specified via --output-file.
Since the exported information is not in all cases specific to
the new cell and can be shared with multiple cells, it does
not make sense to have the new cell name as a required parameter.
Lets remove the name parameter is it is right now that the
export information file name is generic to be used for multiple
cells.

We are replacing all usages of the 'retrying' package with
'tenacity' as the author of retrying is not actively maintaining
the project. Tenacity is a fork of retrying, but has improved the
interface and extensibility (see [1] for more details). Our end
goal here is removing the retrying package from our requirements.

Tenacity provides the same functionality as retrying, but has the
following major differences to account for:
- Tenacity uses seconds rather than ms as retrying did
  (the retry interface in manila exposed time in seconds as well)
- Tenacity has different kwargs for the decorator and
Retrying class itself.
- Tenacity has a different approach for retrying args by
using classes for its stop/wait/retry kwargs.
- By default tenacity raises a RetryError if a retried callable
times out; retrying raises the last exception from the callable.
Tenacity provides backwards compatibility here by offering
the 'reraise' kwarg - we are going to set this in the retry interface
by default.
- For retries that check a result, tenacity will raise if the
retried function raises, whereas retrying retried on all
exceptions - we haven't exposed this in the retry interface.

This patch updates all usages of retrying with tenacity.
Unit tests are added where applicable.

Add documentation explaining the Identity ""personas"" supported
by Cinder and a permissions matrix showing the intended permissions
these personas have with respect to the cinder policy targets.

Also mark policies that need to be deprecated because they're not
fine-grained enough, and introduce new policies to replace them.

Until this warning is removed, you should regard the permissions described here as NOT IMPLEMENTED. Beginning with the Wallaby release, the Block Storage service API v3 takes advantage of the default authentication and authorization apparatus supplied by the Keystone project to give operators a rich set of default policies to control how users interact with the Block Storage service API. .. _cinder-personas: The Cinder Personas ------------------- This is easiest to explain if we introduce the five ""personas"" Cinder recognizes. .. list-table:: The Five Personas :header-rows: 1 * - who - what - Keystone technical info * - project-reader - Has read only access to the API (cannot create, update, or delete) - ``reader`` role with ``project`` scope * - project-member - A normal user in a project (tenant). - ``member`` role with ``project`` scope * - project-admin - All the normal stuff plus some minor administrative abilities in a particular project, for example, able to set the default volume type for a project. - ``admin`` role with ``project`` scope * - system-reader - Has read only access to the full API, including the traditionally ""administrator only"" functions - ``reader`` role with ``system`` scope * - system-admin - A Cinder super-user (can do everything!) - ``admin`` role with ``system`` scope .. note:: The Keystone project provides additional roles, but Cinder does not currently recognize them. In particular: * Cinder does not recognize the ``domain`` scope at all. So even if you successfully request a ""domain-scoped"" token from the Identity service, you won't be able to use it with Cinder. Request a ""project-scoped"" or ""system-scoped"" token instead. * Cinder does not recognize a ""system-member"" persona, that is, someone with the ``member`` role and ``system`` scope. The default Cinder policy configuration treats such a person as identical to the *system-reader* persona described above. .. _cinder-permissions-matrix: Cinder Permissions Matrix ------------------------- Now that you know who the personas are, here's what they can do with respect to the policies that are recognized by Cinder. NOTE: the columns in () will be deleted; they are here for comparison as the matrix is validated by human beings. .. list-table:: Permissions Matrix :header-rows: 1 * - action - API call - policy name -

Puppet-ironic ships with only the ipmi hardware type enabled.

This setting is possibly the most commonly overriden setting
used by operators and also prohibits the community determiend
default form just being used, which creates a friction point
between the two projects.

As such, it makes sense to remove, and just allow ironic's
default to be leveraged, by default.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================ Keystoneless Undercloud (noauth) ================================ The goal of this proposal is to introduce the community to the idea of removing Keystone from TripleO undercloud and run the remaining OpenStack services without authentication and authorization (i.e. Standalone mode). Problem Description =================== With the goal of having a thin undercloud we've been simplifying the undercloud architecture since a few cycles and have removed a number of OpenStack services in the last few cycles. After moving to use `network_data_v2`_ and `ephemeral_heat`_ by defult, we are left with only neutron, ironic and ironic-inspector. Keystone authentication authorization does not add lot of value for undercloud as we run most of the overcloud deployment and configuration as the os user. For large deployments we increase token expiration time to a large value that is orthogonal to keystone security. Proposed Change =============== Overview -------- At present we have keystone running in the undercloud providing catalog, authentication/authorization services to the remaning deployed services neutron, ironic and ironic-inspector. Ephemeral heat uses a fake keystone client which does not talk to keystone. All these remaining services are capabale of running standalone using `noauth` auth_strategy and clients using openstacksdk and keystoneauth can use the NoAuth identity plugin. The proposal is to deploy the remanining OpenStack services in the undercloud with `noauth` and remove keystone from the undercloud. Alternatives ------------ - Keep keystone in the undercloud as before. - Use HTTP basic authentication for ironic and neutron (not explored yet). Security Impact --------------- There should not any significant security implications when disabling keystone on the undercloud. Upgrade Impact -------------- There will be no upgrade impact; this change will be transparent to the end-user. Other End User Impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ Disabling authentication and authorization would make the API calls faster and the overall resource requirements of undercloud would reduce. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- None Developer Impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== - Normally, Identity service middleware provides the X-Project-Id header based on the authentication token submitted by the service client. However when keystone is not available neutron expects `project_id` in the `POST` requests (i.e create API). All neutron create API calls has to be changed to get the `project_id` for `admin` project or use a dummy `project_id` for standlone neutron using `auth_strategy=noauth`. - We don't have THT parameters to configure `auth_strategy` for services. Either add the parameters or use ExtraConfig parameters to undercloud environment to deploy the services with `NoAuth`. .. code-block:: yaml UndercloudExtraConfig: ironic::auth_strategy: noauth ironic::inspector::auth_strategy: noauth neutron::server::auth_strategy: noauth neutron::auth_strategy: noauth - Ironic communicates with `neutron` and `networking-baremetal` agent using the `internal` endpoints. Those would be configured to use `noauth` and not use service catalog. .. code-block:: yaml UndercloudExtraConfig: ironic::service_catalog::endpoint_override: 'http://192.168.24.3:6385' ironic::service_catalog::auth_type: none ironic::neutron::endpoint_override: 'http://192.168.24.3:9696' ironic::neutron::auth_type: none neutron::agents::ml2::networking_baremetal::ironic_url: 'http://192.168.24.3:6385' neutron::agents::ml2::networking_baremetal::auth_type: none - Metalsmith communicates with `neutron` to create ctlplane ports for the instances. It would be changed to use `project_id` in create requests for it to work with standalone `neutron`. - Create/Update clouds.yaml to use `auth_type: none` and use endpoint overrides for the public endpoints with `<service_name>_endpoint_override` entries. .. code-block:: yaml clouds: undercloud: auth: {} auth_type: none baremetal_api_version: '1' baremetal_endpoint_override: https://192.168.24.2:13385/ network_api_version: '2' network_endpoint_override: https://192.168.24.2:13696/ baremetal_introspection_api_version: '1' baremetal_introspection_endpoint_override: https://192.168.24.2:13050 Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ramishra Other contributors: Work Items ---------- - https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tripleo-ansible/+/796589 - More items addressing the details listed in the implementation section Dependencies ============ Ephemeral heat and network-data-v2 are used as defaults.

This patch implements hard affinity and anti-affinity filter for
manila scheduler. Users can specify affinity/anti-affinity share
ids to the field ""share.scheduler_hints.same_host"" or
""share.scheduler_hints.different_host"" in the request payload
when creating a manila share. The scheduler_hints are stored as
share metadata. The filter properties are populated from this
metadata during share migration and so filters will be applied
for share migration as well.

Both fields can be a single share UUID or multiple uuids
separated by comma. For example,

`{
    ""share"": {
        ""scheduler_hints"": {
            ""same_host"": ""share_uuid_1,share_uuid_2"",

RequestConfig singleton object is not working well with eventlet
monkeypatching of threading library which we are doing in Neutron.
As a result it leaks memory in neutron-api workers every time when API

The logs emitted when VeNCrypt is enabled are rather unhelpful and have
some broken formatting:

  Got version string 'b'RFB 003.008'' from compute node
  Got version string 'b'RFB 003.008'' from tenant
  The server sent security types [19]

  Server supports VeNCrypt sub-types (260,)
  Attempting to use the x509None (AuthVeNCryptSubtype.X509NONE) auth sub-type

There are a couple of issues here:

- We're not decoding bytestrings resulting in 'b' prefixes
- We're emitting the integer code for type information but not the names
- We're calling 'str' on an enum value which returns the name of the
  enum rather than the value

Resolve all of these, resulting in a far more pleasant log:

  Got version string 'RFB 003.008' from compute node
  Got version string 'RFB 003.008' from tenant
  Server sent security types: 19 (VENCRYPT)

It seems that using default singleton=True in the

RequestConfig singleton object is not working well with eventlet
monkeypatching of threading library which we are doing in Neutron.
As a result it leaks memory in neutron-api workers every time when API

To avoid that memory leak, let's use singletone=False in that

The current workarounds mechanism allows applying a patch
into a host, usually the Undercloud. With the containerization
of both undercloud and overcloud a new need arises, the option to apply a
patch into a container or list of containers.

This patch adds new workarounds field to apply modifications to overcloud or undercloud containers using tripleo container image prepare[1]. The workaround mechanism takes a ContainerImagePrepare
file and adds desired modifications on top of it. After building containers, modified containers
parameters file are added to desired update or upgrade scripts to update TripleO Heat Templates before update/upgrade run. This way changes in containers are persistent. There is also field 'preparation_commands'
to execute some pre container image prepare commands, for example to download rpms or create custom Dockerfile.

handle OIDC for now - our IdP doesn't support other protocols so testing

When network's MTU is changed, Neutron sends notification about it
to the L3 agents. In case of DVR (and DVR HA) MTU is then changed in
the qrouter- namespace but should be also changed on snat interfaces
in the snat namespace. And that part was missing.

This patch adds special implementation of the internal_network_updated()
method in the DvrEdgeRouter class so it can configure MTU also for
in the snat namespace.

This patch also removed passing attributes ""interface_name"",
""ip_cidrs"" and ""mtu"" to the internal_network_updated() method and adds
""port"" dict to be passed there. It is consistent with what is already
done in e.g. internal_network_added() method and ""port"" dict is actually
necessary to configure properly snat internal interface in the snat
namespace.

This patch adds also functional test of update network mtu for all types
of routers as there was no such test at all.

There is additional issue with DVR-HA which isn't fixed with that patch
and for which follow up will be proposed. Because of that this patch is
marked as partial fix for the related bug.

Number of resources for neutron to divide
the large RPC call data sets always equals 100.
In ""big"" networks even these numbers can be
still huge and cause service timeouts.
Now we can decrease these numbers in config.
