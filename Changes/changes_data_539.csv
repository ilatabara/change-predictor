This patch rehomes neutron.db._model_query into neutron-lib. While
our longer term goal is to use OVO rather than queries and tables, this
module is provided as a stepping stone (as mentioned in release note
herein). The patch also includes a few other APIs that are required for
the rehome including some utils and an exception class.

For more details see the spec on [1].

Also a sample consumption patch can be found on [2]. While it won't work
as-is with the depends on approach (it needs to be rebased on multiple
other DNMs in neutron) I tested it locally. In addition this change
was tested locally with a sample vmware-nsx consumption patch [3].

The sample configuration file is almost never up to date as it has to
be updated by a person submitting a patch.

The implementation of published autogenerated sample config files in
documentation was done in I88a2429dd3cacd1d014b5b441b98fbfee7e1e208
and in If00cd3bcc654a45944c0bc8b3f146c75bd970f9a. These generate
sample configuration files and publish them in the documentation on
every commit, ensuring that they are always up to date, and not
requiring human intervention to be updated.

As has been done with nova (in Mitaka), cinder (in Newton), and
neutron (in Newton) this patch removes the sample config file from the
git tree and replaces it with a README file explaining how to generate
them, or where to find the latest published versions in the online
documentation.

This commit also breaks a related testcase into two distinct tests for
easier readability, making it clearer what the behavior is through one
assertion/concept per test.

Before the first backend container GET request was always for
objects. The proxy then deduced the container's sharding state from
the response headers and if appropriate made a second request for
shard ranges. This was inefficient.

With this patch the first backend container GET request has
X-Backend-Record-Type set to 'auto' which causes the container server
to return shard ranges if it is sharding or sharded, or objects
otherwise. The proxy can deduce which record type it has received from
the response header X-Backend-Record-Type and behave accordingly.

If a large volume is backed up or a lot of concurrent backups happen,
the cinder-backup service goes offline since a lot of these operations
have calls to the C code which are not run on native threads.

When many concurrent backup create/restore operations happen, then
if all of them are greenthreads, and since, when there is a call to the
C code, monkeypatching does not happen by eventlet. Hence, there is no
context switch to other threads until the call to the C library is
completed. This will block context switching to other green threads.
As a result, some of the backup create/restore operations might go to
error state.

The objects on which read/write operations or C function
calls are done are wrapped in Proxy objects so that they run as native
threads.

Added db purge support to delete the soft-deleted records from tables.
In case of tables 'hosts' and 'failover_segments' the decision to purge
the record is made on the basis of 'deleted' and 'deleted_at' column's
value. However in case of 'notifications' table it is decided on the
basis of 'updated_at' column's value as notifications don't have

The Blazar CLI doesn't support show, update and delete host operations
with hostname. It only accepts id because host uses a key called
hypervisor_hostname, rather one called name like for leases.

This patch enables the Blazar CLI to support hostname as well.

We use an optimistic ""lock"" to make the state of the broker we're
replicating hasn't changed since we started replicating before deleting.

There's still a small window after the final check for max_row and
delete_db but it's much better than the unguarded window for the
entirety of replication to all nodes.

If the replicator starts into a db while the sharder is still pumping it
full of cleaved objects we'll skip the delete at the end and pick it up
on the next pass.

Presently ovn-controller container is started with ""-v /run/openvswitch:/run/openvswitch"".
The openvswitch systemd script deletes the /run/openvswitch folder when stopping it in the host.
/run/openvswitch path inside the ovn-controller container becomes a stale directory.
And when the service is started again, it creates the folder again. In order for ovn-controller
to access again, the folder has to be remounted or the ovn-controller container should be
restarted.

As a temporary fix, this patch mounts /run so that when /run/openvswitch is created again, it will
get reflected inside the ovn-controller container. The proper fix has to come from openvswitch
systemd script to not delete /run/openvswitch when stopping the service. This is presently
discusses in OVS mailing list [1], but no proper solution has been arrived yet.

Under certain failure scenarios it may be that although the libvirt
definition for the volume has been removed for the instance that the
associated storage lun on the compute server may not have been fully
cleaned up yet.

In case users try an other attempt to detach volume we should not stop
the process whether the device is not found in domain definition but
try to disconnect the logical device from host.

This commit makes the process to attempt a disconnect volume even if
the device is not attached to the guest.

Conflicts:
	nova/tests/unit/virt/libvirt/test_driver.py

NOTE: The conflicts were due to the newer testcase mocking
'nova.virt.libvirt.host.Host._get_domain' where the older code calls
'nova.virt.libvirt.host.Host.get_domain', and also dealing with the
fact that the older code doesn't pass 'encryption' to
self._disconnect_volume().

This latter issue means that we need to move the call to
encryptor.detach_volume() to ensure it gets called if we hit
exception.DeviceNotFound when detaching the device from
the guest.  This is similar to the original code proposed
in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/515008/9/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py
but it requires special handling for the scenario where cryptsetup
tries to destroy a dm-crypt device that has already been destroyed.

In a new microversion, the GET /resource_providers API accepts a new
`include` query parameter, whose value is a comma-separated list of
any of the keywords `aggregates`, `inventories`, `traits`.  Each keyword
causes the respective information to be included in the response payload
for each resource provider under a key of the same name.

The immediate motivation for this is SchedulerReportClient, which is
retrieving and caching provider information via ProviderTree.  Currently
it must do this via many separate API calls.  Roughly:

 all_rps = api.get('/resource_providers?tree=%s' %
                   rp.uuid)['resource_providers']
 for one_rp in all_rps:
     if one_rp.parent_provider_uuid:
         prov_tree.add_root(...)
     else:
         prov_tree.new_child(...)
     aggs = api.get('/resource_providers/%s/aggregates' % one_rp.uuid)
     prov_tree.update_aggregates(one_rp.uuid, aggs)
     invs = api.get('/resource_providers/%s/inventories' % one_rp.uuid)
     prov_tree.update_inventories(one_rp.uuid, invs)
     traits = api.get('/resource_providers/%s/traits' % one_rp.uuid)
     prov_tree.update_traits(one_rp.uuid, traits)

So for T providers in the tree, we're doing 3T+1 calls to the placement
API.  With this change set, we bring that down to one (i.e. a minimum 4x
reduction in the number of API calls):

 all_rps = api.get('/resource_providers?tree=%s&'
                   'include=aggregates,inventories,traits' %
                   rp.uuid)['resource_providers']
 for one_rp in all_rps:
     if one_rp.parent_provider_uuid:
         prov_tree.add_root(...)
     else:
         prov_tree.new_child(...)
     prov_tree.update_aggregates(one_rp.uuid, one_rp['aggregates'])
     prov_tree.update_inventories(one_rp.uuid, one_rp['inventories'])
     prov_tree.update_traits(one_rp.uuid, one_rp['traits'])

(IRL we'll also need to pull the providers associated with the
aggregates, and their inventories and traits; for simplicity, I omitted
that from the example.)

change ensures that these rules are not persisted.

Ironic Inspector iptables filter driver does not set

Without the group by, postgres complains with:

  column ""root_rp.uuid"" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be
  used in an aggregate function

which is a common complaint between mysql and postgresql. After
that is fixed, it complains about parent_rp.uuid.

This problem was discovered using my placedock container[1] with
a postgres database. The change that causes this to be necessary
must be relatively recent as this wasn't happening last week.

The problem can show up when the outer join to the root_rp and
parent_rp copies of the resource_providers table can only produce
a single row. The joins to those aliased tables are what is
upsetting postgresql.

The previous code had a complex check which asserted that:

1. the boot index list contains 0
2. every element in the boot index list is 1 less than its successor

The second check was in a method called _subsequent_list, which I
assume was intended to be _sequential_list.

However, combined with the constraint that the boot index are >= 0,
the above 2 constraints are the same as asserting that each element in

Currently, the neutron-lib API code fills defaults values for the
attributes defined in a resource map, but does not fill defaults inside
the attributes that are dictionaries.

This change introduces a 'dict_populate_defaults' flag that allows the
defaults to be filled inside dictionary attributes (attributes of any
dictionary type).

This is useful to incorporate networking-sfc APIs and avoid using
the specific normalize_* converter methods [1] (see follow-up changes).

Function `rally.task.convert` is designed to specify which arguments of
scenario plugin should be preprocessed. It accepts keyword arguments
where key is a argument name and value is options for processing.

This function also includes a logic for postponing the loading of
ResourceType plugins to the place where they are actually executed.

I do not know historical reasons, but as for currect code place, we just
can call for obtaining the right ResourceType plugin in the right place
without any wrappers and so on.

Goal: in two diff commits.
Use the update job to gate:
- tripleo-quickstart
- tripleo-quickstart-extras
- tripleo-upgrade

Use the update job to check non-voting
- tripleo-$other repos

At the moment tripleo-upgrade is ungated.
To properly protect against changes in tripleo
repos it is useful to run the update job as
non-voting to help detect if a tripleo change
caused the update job to fail.

It does not make sense to compare the value of two URIs for equality
when trying to determine if the *types* are equal, so change __eq__ to
look at the max_length and schemes, which do describe the type instead
of an instance of a URL.

Since the value property is not used for anything else, it is marked
deprecated so we can remove it in a future version.

In some BGPVPN interconnection scenarios, two EVPNs may be
configured for bagpipe-bgp with same VNI.

This can't be supported by the linux vxlan driver (only a
single vxlan interface can be created for a given VXLAN id,
and it can't be plugged in more than one bridge).

This would be supported by the EVPN OVS driver with some
change.

For these reason, the right thing is to reject the creation
of an EVPN instance having same VNI than another instance.

This change adds a common test role requirements file to the
preparation process whch will ensure all required common roles are
available prior to running tests.

As we move to use common roles throughout our deliverables this change
will help ensure we're not having to map complex common dependencies
throughout our supported roles, which is prone to human error and can
cause cascading failures throughout out stack should a requirement be

Until ONTAP v8.3, the driver used to perform sub-lun clone of up to 64GB
per operation, but as of v9.1, ONTAP handles only 128MB per operation.
This new limit is causing error on volume extending operations, which
triggers sub-lun cloning when resizing exceeds max-resize-geometry.
For instance, if a volume is extended from 1GB to 64GB, the operation
fails because it triggers a single sub-lun cloning of 1GB.

This fix sets the limit used by sub-lun cloning to 128MB, therefore
if a volume is extended from 1GB to 64GB, it no longer fails, and
instead it will trigger 8 sub-lun cloning operations of 128MB.

Releases produced. - * Extended Maintenance * While there are community members maintaining it. * All bugfixes (that meet the criteria described below) are appropriate. No Releases produced, reduced CI commitment. - * End of Life (EOL) * N/A * Branch no longer accepting changes It is not required that all project for a given branch transition between phases at the same time. For example it's quite reasonable for the ``stable/$series`` branch of ``openstack/long-life-project`` to still be in the supported phase will all other projects have transitioned to either Extended Maintenance or even End of Life.Supported --------- For any project/branch combination that is considered supported OpenStack Infrastructure, `OpenStack Vulnerability Management`_ and QE tools are expected to work and be active. Project teams will produce consumable releases and upgrades are tested. Per Project Stable teams and the Stable Maintainers are responsible for all `tagged`_ projects during the this phase. Extended Maintenance -------------------- Once a project reaches Extended Maintenance project teams will cease producing releases and `OpenStack Vulnerability Management`_ will be best effort only. There is no statement about the level of testing and upgrades from Extended Maintenance are not supported within the Community. Members of the community interested in a given project/branch are encouraged to engage with the appropriate stable team *early* in it's life-cycle to ensure this process runs well. After all if there are no maintainers a project will probably be marked as End of Life .. note:: Some projects teams may choose to NOT enter extended maintenance and go directly to End of Life. At which point should a group wish to maintain that branch of a project they're able to do so within license and tradmark constrtaints. Some OpenStack CI testing *may* me availble via `Zuul drivers`_ End of Life ----------- After some period of time, if a project/branch is effectively un-maintained and testing is ineffective it will become necessary to mark this project/branch as End Of Life. At which point the HEAD of the appropriate branch will be tagged as ``$series-eol`` and the branch deleted. There will be a notification period of approximately 6 months before this happens and should maintainers be found a project can be placed back into Extended Maintenance. It's nevertheless allowed to backport fixes for other bugs if their safety can be easily proved. For example, documentation fixes, debug log message typo corrections, test only changes, patches that enhance test coverage, configuration file content fixes can apply to all supported branches. For those types of backports, stable maintainers will decide on case by case basis. .. note::.. _OpenStack Vulnerability Management: https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html .. _Zuul Drivers: https://docs.openstack.org/infra/zuul/admin/connections.html#drivers .. _tagged: https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/tags/stable_follows-policy.html","Stability is always a trade-off between ""bug-free"" and ""slow-moving"". In order to reach that stability, we define several support phases. :widths: 10 20 20 50 - * Phase * Changes Supported - * I * First 6 months * Latest release appropriate - * II * 6-12 months after release * Maintained release * Only critical bugfixes and security patches are acceptable - * III * more than 12 months after release * Legacy release * Only security patches are acceptable .. note:: It's nevertheless allowed to backport fixes for other bugs if their safety can be easily proved. For example, documentation fixes, debug log message typo corrections, test only changes, patches that enhance test coverage, configuration file content fixes can apply to all supported branches. For those types of backports, stable maintainers will decide on case by case basis. Given that stable branches are created every 6 months, that means that at any given time, only one branch is in Phase I support and only one branch is in Phase II support. Depending on how long each branch is supported, there may be one or more releases in Phase III support.",71,29

Using config-download with deployed-server requires the use of a
HostnameMap since the configuration generated by Heat needs the hostname
value, and we can't know it until we use ansible to get the value.

A HostnameMap parameter value works around that limitation by explicitly
telling Heat what the hostname value is for each deployed-server.

We have detected a spurious failure on unittest
QuotaIntegrationTestCase.test_too_many_volumes_of_type that presented as
a ""not bound to a Session; lazy load operation"" error for the ""projects""
attribute of a Volume Type.

This is not an error on the tests but an error on the OVO-ORM mechanism
we have to create a VolumeType instance.

When we create a VolumeType we return created volume type as we have
sent it to the DB (not actually reading from the DB the current values)
so we don't have the ""projects"" field loaded in the ORM instance, which
means that SQLAlchemy will try to lazy load it when we get the project
value on the ""_from_db_object"".

There are 3 possible solutions to the problem:

- Read from the DB the VolumeType with the project list

- Change the way we do the db_type.get so we check against the
dictionary instead of the ORM object so we don't trigger the lazy
loading: `vars(db_type).get('projects', [])`

- On the ""volume_type_create"" method in the DB return the projects field
with the right values.

This patch implements the last approach which fixes the VolumeType
creation issue.

In another patch we could address other potential cases where we could
be missing the project field as well, as mentioned in the second
approach, and that would require changing our fakes to use actual ORM
instances instead of dictionaries, and probably also adapting some
cinder code and additional tests.

Instead of porting [1] and [2] back along with other patches

We can see that it fails on the empty Compute role.

This fix that error.

Now to avoid looping without end over non-existing role, we count the
number of host in each role and skip over those that are not expected.

This is not required in later version as the OVERCLOUD_ROLES variable
is passed to the script explicitly.

Merging of those contexts in order to evaluate the workflow output consumed a lot of memory. Now this algorithm is rewritten with batched DB query and Python generators so that GS has a chance to destroy objects that have already been processed. Previously all task executions had to stay in memory until the end of the processing. The result is that now it consumes 3 times less memory on heavy cases.,,12,0

Merging of those contexts in order to evaluate the workflow output consumed a lot of memory. Now this algorithm is rewritten with batched DB query and Python generators so that GS has a chance to destroy objects that have already been processed. Previously all task executions had to stay in memory until the end of the processing. The result is that now it consumes 3 times less memory on heavy cases.,,12,0

In case when network was shared with specified project
by RBAC rule and it was also set as ""shared"" there was
a bug which forbid to set such network as not shared even
if only projects which still used network was owner and
project with specified RBAC rule.

This patch fixes it by adding additional check in

To unrescue a node, it is necessary to prepare to boot the node with
a user image as the node is deployed. This preparation depends on a
deploy interface as well as a boot interface. For example, when a whole
disk image is used, 'direct' deploy interface sets the boot device to
'disk' regardless of boot option, while 'iscsi' deploy interface calls
boot.prepare_instance(), which may see boot option. So, just calling
boot.prepare_instance() is not enough for unrescuing a node.

This patch adds prepare_instance_to_unrescue() method to deploy
interface. This method calls boot.prepare_instance() by default as
AgentRescue.unrescue() used to do. 'direct' deploy interface sets the
boot device to 'disk' for a whole disk image in this method because
the boot device may be changed to boot a rescue ramdisk at rescuing.
'ansible' deploy interface always sets the  boot device to 'disk'.

This scenario requires zaqar to support message tag filtering, which distributes messages with different message tags to different subscriptions for the same topic. This feature supports all subscription endpoint, including mail, webhook. Problem description =================== The current subscription does not support message filtering, so when a subscriber subscribes to a topic, all messages which sent to the topic will be sent to all subscribers, which will be a lot less flexible. So, this feature is intended to solve the problem, which allows the user to specify the tags when creating a subscription and publish messages, and ultimately through the tags match to determine the message will be sent to which subscriber. Proposed change =============== To do this, both the message and the subscription need to add a new attribute named ``tags``, which is a list of strings. When you create a subscription, you can specify a list of tags, just like this:: ``{'subscriber': 'http://example.com/sub', 'options':{'tags': ['test', 'test2']}}`` Then when you send a message to the queue, you can choose to add the attribute, just like this:: ``{'body': 'test', 'tags': ['test', 'test2']}`` Finally, zaqar decides which subscribers the message should be sent to based on the following rules: * If the subscriber does not have any tags, all messages will be sent to the subscriber. * If the message does not contain any tags, it can not be sent to the subscriber which has tags. * If the message and the subscriber's tags have intersecting collections, the message is sent to the subscriber. * If the message and the subscriber both have tags, but there is no intersection set, so no message is sent to the subscriber.

live_migration_scheme was being used when live_migration_inbound_addr was set.
This prohibits a non-default port/user/extra_params being used, which is often
required to fully describe the uri, particularly for the ssh transport
(see bug#1671288).

However live_migration_inbound_addr also works with live_migration_uri, so for
now revert back to using live_migration_uri in all cases.

When using Ansible 2.5, delegation of a task from a container to a host
that is not mentioned in the inventory is currently broken.

The connection plugin works by comparing the host vars 'container_name'
and 'physical_host' to determine if a target host is a container. Both
of these variables are specific to hosts within an OSA generated
inventory. When delegating to a host outside of the inventory however,
the variables will remain cached from the originating host, so a task
wouldn't actually delegate at all.

This is fixed by checking that the 'inventory_hostname' is the same as
the 'container_name'.

The reality is that the upgrade script is always in
development, as is all open source software. Instead
of having this extra warning we just have one which
provides a suitable warning to use this in a test

Also, we remove the set -v because the output of the

Upgrades fail on master due to changes to the library functions,
specifically ""get_pip"" which now requires a variable passed to it. Since
the library was sourced before it gets called in the Ocata branch this
caused failures when the function was called.

To fix this we should source the library after we change branches, and
not before. Additionally, we should source the scripts-library.sh from
master once we change back to the master branch.

In our logs it is frequent that the warning to upgrade the
pip version is present, but this warning is unnecessary as
we are always using a well tested version of pip.

To reduce noise, we set disable the version check. This has
the added benefit of not adding more internet access to every
pip task than is necessary.

In the template we ensure that the var is interpreted as a
boolean (in case of user error), then force it to lower case
as that's what pip prefers in pip.conf.

We also now remove the test for the self check file, as it
will no longer be present with this option implemented.

This patch implements an initial set of jobs intended to match
the current job execution method. It does not intend to improve
how the jobs are executed - only to replicate what is currently
in openstack-infra/openstack-zuul-jobs and provide the platform
to iterate on.

This also removes the duplicate openstack_hosts role from

Blueprint add-kvm-hidden-feature added the capability of hiding the kvm
signature from guests. However, it was implemented only through an image
property.

A major reason for this feature is to allow passed-through Nvidia GPUs
to work correctly. GPU pci-passthrough is specified on the flavor's
extra_specs, without requiring an image with special properties.
Therefore, hiding the KVM signature should also be specifiable through
the flavor's extra_specs, in order to not require a special image for
this use case.

If the new flavor extra_spec is present and set to 'true', the libvirt
driver will produce an additional element to hide kvm's signature on
the vm, in the same way as with the image property
`img_hide_hypervisor_id`.

Create a tox environment for running the unit tests against the lower
bounds of the dependencies.

Create a lower-constraints.txt to be used to enforce the lower bounds
in those tests.

Add openstack-tox-lower-constraints job to the zuul configuration.

Note that manila-ui does not support python3 yet so lower-constraints
env uses python2 unlike other projects.

The major_upgrade tasks for HA services only allows to change the container
image tag used by bundles. It doesn't work when the image name changes.

Fix this unwanted behaviour by updating the bundle's attribute in pacemaker
to use container image <NEW>:pcmklatest instead of <CURRENT>:pcmklatest
We are constrained by the steps at when we can modify the bundle:
  . Image update must stay at step 3 when pacemaker is stopped.
  . image name used by the bundle must be available in docker when the
    bundle is updated

So we re-use the double tagging idiom to perform the image update:
  . At step 0, we tag the image pointed to by <CURRENT>:pcmklatest
    with an additional temporary tag <NEW>:pcmklatest.
    => this ensures that at step1, the new tag is available on all
       controller nodes.
  . At step 1, we update the resource bundle to use the new image
    name <NEW>:pcmklatest.
    => at the end of step1, the bundle will be configured with the
       new name, and be able to start even if the real container
       image hasn't be pulled yet.
  . At step 3, the existing code will download the real image
    <NEW>:<NEWTAG> and make tag <NEW>:pcmklatest point to it.

Since the bundle is always modified, we now stop and restart the
bundle resources unconditionally.

Also, move the mariadb upgrade task to step 3, when pacemaker is
guaranteed to be stopped, because the task assumes that no mysql
is running while it runs. Fix the mysql permission after rpm
upgrade on the host.

https://review.openstack.org/#/c/559061/ introduced a ffwd-upgrade-
converge.yaml environment file to be used at the end of the ffu
process, before running the ceph upgrade. This change adjusts the
workflow to include the converge stage.

In addition it adjusts the scenario environment file in the overcloud
deploy script so any scripts built of it make use of the new one.

This change makes ""DELETE /os-services/{service_id}"" fail
with a 409 response when attempting to delete a nova-compute
service which is still hosting instances.

Deleting a compute service also results in deleting the
related compute_nodes table entry for that service host.
The compute node resource provider in placement is tied
to the compute node via the UUID, and if we allow deleting
the compute service and node then the resource provider for
that node is effectively orphaned in Placement, along with
the instances which have allocations against that resource
provider.

Furthermore, restarting the compute service will create a
new service and compute_nodes record, and the compute node
would have a new UUID and resource provider. This will
affect scheduling for that host since Placement will be
reporting it as having available capacity which in reality
is not accurate.

A release note is included for the (justified) behavior
change in the API. A new microversion should not be required
for this since admins should not have to opt out of broken
behavior. Since this API did not previously expect to return
a 409 response, the ""expected_errors"" decorator is updated
and again, should not require a microversion per the
guidelines:

Presently, tempest in the integrated build is installed from PyPI, but without

This commit removes the tempest_git_* overrides from
