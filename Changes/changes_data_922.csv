When Nova/os-vif creates the 1st patch port pair from a trunk bridge to

To support multi-tenant networking in Ironic we need to be able to
discover not just the NICs a baremetal machine has but also the physical
connectivity to switches in the network.

This patch collects LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) data as part of
the list interfaces stage of the generic hardware manager. This
information can then be processed by the ironic inspector to populate
the local link information on each ironic port.

The processing done on this data in ironic python agent is limited, this
is to allow for server side processing hooks to process as much or as
little of the data as they want. This is to allow for multi-vendor
environments that might use different parts of the LLDP packet to use a
generic ramdisk and configure the processing server side using inspector
plugins.

Reserved fields switch_port_descr and switch_chassis_descr have been
deprecated for removal in Ocata in favor of passing the whole packet.

It's not necessary anymore and has been therefore removed.

The devref details have been updated to present tense, as they should be.

The gateway ip can be configured to be different than the seed ip.
If this is done however, there is no port configured as the gateway
which results in a non-functioning configuration. Someone may want
to move the gateway away from the seed to provide the ability to
shutdown the seed but continue to access the remainder of the cloud
environment.  If the gateway ip is different from the seed ip, a port
is created on brbm and assigned the gateway ip.

https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation/Migrate#API_Reference_Plan

This patch contains the content of the Images v2 API reference converted
to RST.  The content has been corrected where I noticed divergences with
reality.

The tox environment to build the api-ref docs is introduced in the
dependency.

Note to reviewers: The conversion project is ongoing, that is, the doc
team is continuing to develop tools (for example, to display the
response codes in a table) and converging on a style for these docs.
So this isn't a final product, there will be more patches later.  While
this patch is not perfect, it is pareto-optimal with respect to content
(it's at least as good as the current guide, and better in at least one
place).  Thus my advice, should you choose to take it, is that we should
merge this patch to get these docs in-tree, and make improvements as
additional patches rather than try to get everything perfect on this
patch.

This changes the subscribe calls to happen on object construction

This changes the scope validation to occur after a token has already
been created.

Previous flow:

1. Validate authentication options.
2. Validate authorization options if the command requires a scope.
3. Create a token (using authentication + authorization options)
4. Run command.

This means that scope was being checked, even if a default scope was
applied in step 3 by Keystone.

New flow:

1. Validate authentication options.
2. Create token (using authentication + authorization options)
3  Validate authorization options if the command requires a scope and
   the token is not scoped.
4. Run command.

This changes the scope validation to occur after a token has already
been created.

Previous flow:

1. Validate authentication options.
2. Validate authorization options if the command requires a scope.
3. Create a token (using authentication + authorization options)
4. Run command.

This means that scope was being checked, even if a default scope was
applied in step 3 by Keystone.

New flow:

1. Validate authentication options.
2. Create token (using authentication + authorization options)
3  Validate authorization options if the command requires a scope and
   the token is not scoped.
4. Run command.

The conditional logic to create the char devices is spread over 2 methods
which makes it confusing to understand under which conditions which char
devices get created for the guest. As the ""virtlogd"" feature will append a
sub element ""log"" to the first(!) char device in a following change, a
refactoring of these conditionals will make the future change easier to
understand.
This change:
* inlines method ""_create_serial_console_devices""
* changes the unit tests accordingly

This refactoring step makes it later easier to understand which functional
changes get introduced and under which conditions.

Since then, it has developed these features. (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.2.0) Though Kolla deploys the containers using Ansible, we can leverage the current work by using the config generation and injecting the configs into the Kubernetes pod. Problem description =================== Kubernetes - life-cycle management: service monitoring, restarting, and scaling - upgrades: rolling and all at once upgrades Kubernetes has services/tools that can provide service monitoring, health checks, service scaling, and upgrades. We can use the scheduler to assign work loads to appropriate nodes. Kubernetes has built in health checks that will maintain the container's status. And we can use the replication processes[1] to scale up and down our stack. For upgrades, Kubernetes has a tool called 'deployments'[2], which will detect when there is a config change in the container and start scaling down the current running container and scaling up the new container. If the new container fails, it can roll back, a nice feature containers provide for us. Though this is oversimplified for OpenStack, we can make use of this. Proposed change =============== - Add a deployment specific git repo (kolla-kubernetes) to contain the Kubernetes deployment code. Bootstrapping ------------- We need a way of bootstrapping the services similar to the way ansible does it. Kubernetes does have a run_once param [3] that we can use for the bootstrap. We can then overwrite the bootstrap pod with the pod for running service. Security impact --------------- The deployed OpenStack’s security should not be affected by the deployment tool. In addition, if we containerize the config data so that it can be injected into a pod, we can leverage the selinux capabilities in the config container. Performance Impact ------------------ Unknown Implementation ============== Primary Assignee(s) ----------- Ryan Hallisey (rhallisey) Other contributor(s): Michal Rostecki (mrostecki) Swapnil Kulkarni (coolsvap) MD NADEEM (mail2nadeem92) Vikram Hosakote (vhosakot) <Please add your name here if you are getting involved in kolla-kubernetes> Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: unknown Work Items ---------- 1. Change start.yml files so that they can inject configs into Kubernetes pod. 2. Add support for kolla-kubernetes to kolla-cli. Testing ======= Functional tests will be implemented in the OpenStack check/gating system to automatically checks that the Kubernetes deployment works for an AIO environment. Documentation Impact ==================== Add a quick start guide which will explain how to deploy kolla-kubernetes. Add a develop guide on how to contribute, which also explains how the deployment works.

Recently merged commit to ""neutron-fwaas"" project [1] started using
one of Tempest's modules that appeared after version our plugin uses.
So, implement hotfix-workaround until we make all compatibility changes

For the moment, we cannot switch to latest Tempest as we already

Currently, Manila CI Tempest jobs use deprecated options of Tempest.
Recently, latest version of Tempest dropped them [1].
Manila CI jobs work ok, because they check out specific version of
Tempest. But it will work until first Devstack update for some one
more Tempest feature and then we will be forced to use latest Tempest
again. Switch to supported approach of setting up users in Tempest,
to avoid such sudden blockers.

Squashed with [Tempest] Bump tempest version
Fix small incompatibility that left to be done and bump Tempest version
to unblock our CI jobs.

All the tests used a very 'strong' password of mypassword and it
wasn't apparent in reviewing some new tests whether the masking was
being done of the 'word' password in mypassword or the command option
or dictionary key.

password.

We can't modify old migrations, since they might already have been
run some places, and you'll end up with different database structures
depending on which version you ran.

The correct fix for this problem is to add a new migration that fixes
the structure.

Allow configuration of keystone with Apache via environement variable.
Below are the reasons why we need Apache:

1.  Keystone federation support requires Apache. Federation can only be
supported in conjunction with Apache as it needs both mod_mellon and mod_shib.

2. Performance. Unlike Nova or Swift, Keystone is using eventlet with a
single thread instead of multiple worker processes. So can't take
advantage of multi core node.  Apache give us the flexibility to run
multiple threads and multiple processes, and therefore much better
throughput. Though there are effects underway to make Keystone a
multi-worker process, those changes has not been landed and may
take time to mature.

3. SSL Authorization. Support for client certs.  Since SSL client
certificate already authenticate a given service, there's no need
for service to use a service token to validate user tokens. We simply
map the SSL client certificate attributes into Keystone identity attributes
to form a authorization context for API authorization.  Eventlet's SSL
capability is inferior to Apache by far! You can't get the
client SSL certificate attributes from eventlet.

In PY3, print should used as a function instead of a statement.
This is PY27 compatible as well.

For example, instances of the first case were replaced by the
second case:

>>> print 'help'

SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'

Since delete notifications don't contain the parent network_id, we can't
determine a routing id in these cases. project_id would be an
alternative choice for routing but doesn't cover cases where subnets can
be attached to another tenant's network (and thus routing by project_id
would leave unpredictable results).

Patch runs a search request to get the parent (and routing) id for
subnet and port deletes. Upstream patch
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/289050 will make this unnecessary if it
ever merges; at that point we can get the network_id from the payload.

Additionally fixes some issues in the index helper code related to
accessing metafields (_routing, _parent) in searches that changed
between ES 1.x and 2.x.

Use freezer-manage instead of freezer-db-init to create/update/delete
elasticsearch mappings. freezer-manage will add couple of more
functionalities. freezer-manage reads from the same configuration
file like freezer-api and uses the same db info.

How to use:

To create the mappings::

freezer-manage db sync

To update the mappings::

freezer-manage db update

To remove the mappings::

freezer-manage db remove

To print the mappings::

freezer-manage db show

To update settings:

The lxc_container_create role has been updated to build containers to
the same distribution and release as the host machine. The
container_release property defined in environment files used to
generate inventory is no longer required.

And nearly all failed builds require an engineer to investigate the logs and code to answer what type of component or API was responsible for the issue. ---------------- Proposed changes ---------------- Add custom Exception classes for each type of possible error that can be identified by fuel-qa code. Examples: * FuelMasterSetupFailed * NodeProvisioningFailed * OSTFTestFailed * etc also use full path to the Exception in the code: fuel_qa.errors.FuelMasterSetupFailed These changes helps to separate product error from framework errors because all errors that are not defined in fuel_qa are errors of the framework code.

Partitions schema and disk metadata at nodes must be updated only
if they are scheduled for reprovisioning, and the provisioning
method has changed to incompatible (i.e. from 'cobbler' to 'image')
due to the shift of release version.

Move logic that manages partitions from upgrade handlers to function
that actually initiates the re-provisioning of node. This ensures
that for every node this is applied only once and only if necessary.

Currently, when a parameter is formatted wrong sphinx dies with a
cryptic error message:

    AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'items'

This happens because the parameter is not recognized as dict.

This patch adds a check that ensures parameters are formatted correctly
by verifying that they're dicts.

Added a script to clean up the rabbitmq definitions file which is
being generated during the post-deployment phase of a deployment.
Previosly the definitions file contained all RPC queues presented in
RabbitMQ after the successful deployment. These queues are one-off, and
their restoration via OCF-script leads to growth of unconsumed messages,
which, in turn, lead to RabbitMQ slowness and malfunctions.

This is a rework of the previously reverted change
Ie3f3194b3eaaa8dc28d1cd3442090b586e177306 which caused deployment
failures in some scenarios involving partial update. This happened
because the script was delivered in a separate package which has not
been updated during the partial update. Now the script is
delivered in the puppet's directory instead. Also introduced
additional regexp-matching logic to instantly remove all the RPC queues,
which were left in the previous version of the fix.

Patch enables passing Product and Vendor ID to Inspector. These parameter
could be exposed using the Port's ""extra"" field.
Product id, enables to identify the capabilities of the device(ex, does the
device has SR-IOV capabilities or not), which would help in creating heat
template or building images using diskimage builder.

Patch generalizes the _get_device_vendor function, enabling it to be used with
both block and net devices and add new function _get_device_vendor to get
product id.
Adds two attributes vendor_id, product_id to NetworkInterface class.

This brings the Images API Reference to the glance tree as part of
the effort described here:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation/Migrate#API_Reference_Plan

This patch introduces (a) the tox environment to generate the api-ref,
and (b) the content of the Images v1 API reference converted to RST.
The content has been corrected where I noticed divergences with reality.

Note to reviewers: The conversion project is ongoing, that is, the doc
team is continuing to develop tools (for example, to display the response
codes in a table) and converging on a style for these docs.  So this isn't
a final product, there will be more patches later.  While this patch is
not perfect, it is pareto-optimal with respect to content (it's at least
as good as the current guide, and better in at least one place).  Thus
my advice, should you choose to take it, is that we should merge this
patch to get these docs in-tree, and make improvements as additional
patches that can focus on particular API calls rather than try to get
everything perfect on this patch.

The working directory can be either a relative path or absolute path

the working directory is absolute, but if `tempest init [dir]` is

This patch deprecates ListOpt and mark it for removal. ListOpt is mostly used
for multi valued options. Unfortunately, it separate options using "","" in their
definition string, which is less reliable than using MultiOpt which on the
opposite:

1. is more reliable by using a line for each value rather than spliting a

2. is easier to use as a CLI option (native  argparse support)

This should improve the overall configuration user experience.

Currently autoheal functionality is a subset of OCF script

also handles all sort of cases where rabbitmq becomes stuck). But as
both of this functions cause stopping and starting of rabbits, it
results in unwanted interference - as we've observed in 1585128, where

If we're explicitly told to not allocate networks, then
don't, skip network allocation.

This also skips network deallocation if we can tell that
we wouldn't have allocated networks because 'none' was

an optimization when requested_networks is available - which
is not the case with a local delete from the compute API.

The original commit adding support for process limits only wired
up address space, max files and resident set size limits. This
is not sufficient to enable nova to protect qemu-img commands
against malicious images.

This commit adds support for the remaining limits supported
by python: core file size, cpu time, data size, file size,
locked memory size, max processes and stack size.

Rather than having a fake_notifier which stores notifications,
just mock notify calls and ensure that the expected calls

The previous method of doing this was fundamentally flawed
and racy -- this should fix up the reoccuring issues with
notifications tests failures.

The Packaging-Deb team was added August 13, 2015. Since that date
we added a requirement for minimum activity (following the rejection
of the Kosmos team), so it seems fair (after a decent grace period)
to revisit previously-approved official project teams based on that
new requirement.

The Packaging-Deb team specifies 25 repositories, of which only
one was created. That repository has two boilerplate commits[1].
Progress is not being discussed on the ML or in regular IRC
meetings. As far as OpenStack is concerned, this team basically
hasn't started yet.

When the issue was raised at the last PTL elections, Thomas Goirand
(the original team creator and main contributor) justified the
team existence in a ML thread[2]. In particular, the team is
actually active, but on alioth.debian.org git repositories.

While the team may be active, it is not an OpenStack project team,
it is a Debian project team, and all the visible work currently
happens there (on Debian git repositories and IRC channels). So I
don't think that should count toward ""activity"" for the OpenStack
official project team we are considering.

Thomas also said that progress is being stalled on getting a Debian
image supported in OpenStack Infrastructure, an objective that has
been lacking the necessary manpower or priority to be completed
until now. Being punted back to unofficial status would undo the
last 10 months efforts.

While this might have been true one year ago, we now no longer
undo anything when a project team is made unofficial, the git
repositories can stay up under the same name, and infrastructure
bits can be configured the same. So making the unborn project
""unofficial"" does not undo any work that's been done, it only
reflects the actual status of the project team.

When the team starts working on the OpenStack side and the
repositories see some activity, I'll be more than happy to
reconsider adding this team. But for the time being we need
to remove it, if only to be fair with other nascent new teams
that we reject based on lack of past activity.

The proper sequence to upgrade controllers is:

- upgrade primary controller in isolation
- cut over to the new control plane
- upgrade remaining controllers at once

To exclude the possibility to upgrade single controller after
the cutover, add validation of roles of nodes to upgrade and
stop if the only node passed to the script is a CIC.

Recently, oslo.messaging does a refactor [1] which causes
get_batch_notification_listener returns a new type
BatchNotificationServer instead of previous MessageHandlingServer,
they have different attributes, so our test code which relies on
MessageHandlingServer fails in CI gate.

This patch makes test code not rely on oslo.messaging details.

Correct concurrency of gabbi tests for gabbi 1.22.0

When running gabbi under testr, concurrency grouping is controlled
by a regex in .testr.conf. A module name change in gabbi 1.22.0
inadvertently broke the grouping. This change should work for
old and new versions.

Barbican currently supports a plugin architecture for secret stores.
One such secret store implementation is the KMIP secret store. There
are no checks in place at the moment to test the functionality of
Barbican with this plugin.

This patch creates a new Jenkins job to test Barbican with the KMIP
secret store plugin. The end effect will be running all of Barbican's
functional tests using a KMIP secret store plugin. This change enables
the PyKMIP server to run as part of the devstack setup.

The tests can only be run on the latest code. The older stable
branches for kilo, liberty, and mitaka are not supported because the
necessary devstack plugin code is not backported to those branches.
The KMIP secret store job is experimental for now until tests verify
the correct operation.

When using list_limit configuration option in Default section of
keystone.conf, the /services?name=<service_name> API fails to find
the service if list_limit value is smaller than the total number
of services and the searched service is not among the first
'list_limit' services. The API should first filter by name and

Also, this patch fixes setting the 'truncated' attribute of the
driver's hint.limit object when truncating the list outside of

problem described in the first paragraph.

And finally, add the security group options to the neutron-ovn-db-sync-util
command.

Problem description =================== Consider that user may have different environment setting under different scope. Current design didn't give administrator to scope spicific environment. We should create resources for environment, give user ability to dynamically set (or registry) environment parameters, resource_registry, or other section in environment file. Proposed change =============== * Create resources for environment, give user ability to dynamically set (or registry) environment parameters, resource_registry, or other section in environment file. 1. Environment Resource registry Namespace: OS::Heat::EnvironmentResourceRegistry Required Properties: -------------------- name: Name for environemnt resource registry. String value. Update allowed. resource_type: Namespace for resource to registry. String value. Update allowed. resource_template: Template file. Map value. Update allowed. Optional Properties: -------------------- description: Description for environment resource registry. String value. Update allowed. 2. Environment Parameter Namespace: OS::Heat::EnvironmentParameters Required Properties: -------------------- name: Name for environemnt parameter. String value. Update allowed. parameter_key: Key for parameter. String value. Update allowed. parameter_value: Value for parameter. String value. Update allowed. Optional Properties: -------------------- description: Description for environment parameter. String value. Update allowed. 3. Environment Namespace: OS::Heat::Environment Required Properties: -------------------- name: Name for environemnt. String value. Update allowed. parameters: A set of parameter for this environment. List value. Update allowed. resource_registry: A set of resource_registry for this environment. List value. Update allowed. Optional Properties: -------------------- description: Description for environment. String value. Update allowed. scope: Define Scope for environment. Map value. Update allowed. force: Force to overwrite. Boolean value. Update allowed. * Create Database schema for Environment Environment topology for Environment resources. 1. environment table_name: environment Colume: ------- id: Environement object ID. Integer value. Primary key. name: Environment name. Name for environment. String value. description: Environemnt description. String value. scope: Environemnt scope.

This change proposes a new timeutils.isoformat() to replace the earlier
one which was deprecated.

Several issues with the old isotime() function became apparent in
reviewing the steps required to handle the deprecation of
isotime(). These are detailed in the bug 1592181.

I strongly urge all reviewers to read the bug (referenced) and the
comments as part of the review.

WARNING: This code as proposed could introduce inconsistencies in the
way in which the earlier isotime() returns results. Specifically,
these two situations are known.

1. If you provide a timestamp that includes timezone information, the
old isotime() would wilfully ignore it, the new isoformat() function
will produce offset information in the resulting string. If the
timezone is UTC, you will get the 'Z' suffix, if it is non-UTC, you
will get the full 6 character offset +/-hh:mm.

2. If you provided isotime() with the subsecond parameter it returned
the (im)PERFECT_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT which included subsecond information
but NO timezone information. The new isoformat() returns timezone
information. If the timezone is UTC, you will get the 'Z' suffix, if
it is non-UTC, you will get the full 6 character offset +/-hh:mm.

In addition, a behavior which makes this implementation of isoformat()
differ from the original is that if you provide isoformat() with a
timestamp that includes invalid timezone information (such as an
offset greater than one day) then isoformat() will throw a
ValueError. The old isotime() was wilfully unaware and you wouldn't
get such an exception.

Tests have been proposed which exercise the new isoformat() function.

The term ""wilfully unaware"" that I use in the description above is
non-standard. It is not the same as 'naive'. Rather, 'wilfully
unaware' indicates code that knowingly treats timestamps as naive
without checking or making any consideration for whether they are
aware or naive.

I believe that this code, warts and all is better than having multiple
buggy copies of isotime() in each project; each just slightly
different from the other to make your skin crawl. It is generally
advisable when you have bad apples, to put them all together and away
from the good ones. This change attempts to do that.

Creating specific partitions will cause a udev event to trigger,
causing systemd to attempt to mount the new partition at /usr/share/oem.

This mount will not succeed, but will unmount /usr/share/oem,
causing ironic-python-agent to die.

Masking this unit disables this behavior.

The previous MAC duplicate detection code relied on catching a
DBDuplicateError the correct time which resulted in two problems.
First, the duplicate could have been caused by something else being
flushed to the database at the same time.
Second, the DBDuplicate may not occur at flush time if the conflict
happens due to two concurrent port creations and it will instead
happen at commit time.

This patch just dumps the DBDuplicate catch to allow the API layer
to retry the operation since MAC collisions on a network should be
extremely rare.

This patch changes how brick determines how to execute commands
in the system either using privsep or processutils.

When the cinder.conf and nova.conf aren't setup with the helper_command,
os-brick will fallback to using the putils.execute() with the root_helper
and run_as_root kwargs.   This effectively will fall back to running all
commands via rootwrap.  We have to do this for systems that run
Continuous Deployment and don't upgrade their conf files with the

There's little point in having a unit test that mirrors the logic of the
function it is testing, so refactor to assert the behaviour we want
explicitly. Also, add a test for a missing case.

In addition, the test_update_rollback_on_cancel_event test should have
changed the message from 'cancel' to 'cancel_with_rollback' in the patch
b76f6ec0e97a9c3aaf5b5140e7a449c9636b8f95, but this was inadvertently
omitted.

This reverts commit ac86702172ddf01f5bdc3f3cd99d2e32ad9b7024.

The switch to checking for is_admin_project on the auth token for
context_is_admin, makes heat unusable in a TripleO deployed
overcloud. I discussed with Adam Young from the Keystone team, and
he advised a revert until the issue is resolved in oslo.context[0].

From an upstream perspective, I see us as being in the business
of providing open collaboration playing fields in order to build
projects to reach the OpenStack Mission. We collectively provide
resources (infra, horizontal teams, events...) in order to enable
that open collaboration.

An important characteristic of these open collaboration grounds
is that they need to be a level playing field, where no specific
organization is being given an unfair advantage. I expect the teams
that we bless as ""official"" project teams to operate in that fair
manner. Otherwise we end up blessing what is essentially a trojan
horse for a given organization, open-washing their project in the
process. Such a project can totally exist as an unofficial project
(and even be developed on OpenStack infrastructure) but I don't
think it should be given free space in our Design Summits or
benefit from ""OpenStack community"" branding.

So if, in a given project team, developers from one specific
organization benefit from access to specific knowledge or hardware
(think exclusive access to proprietary hardware or software that
the open source code primarily interfaces with), then this project
team should be rejected under the ""open community"" rule.

This requirement (like all requirements in this document) is meant
to be interpreted by humans on a case-by-case basis. In particular,
there is a grey area around drivers for proprietary solutions that
requires human judgment here. As a rule of thumb, if the open
implementation was unusable open core bait to lure people into
using the one and only proprietary driver, it would be a problem.
If the open implementation was fully functional and nothing
prevented adding additional proprietary drivers to the code base,
there would be no problem.

In order to provide vlan-aware VM functionality within the Neutron OVS
agent (in a way that would also be compatible with OVS-DPDK), an
instance's tap device needs to be attached to an OVS ""trunk"" bridge that
is then connected into the OVS integration bridge using a patch port
pair.

This is very similar to the current way that ovs_hybrid plugging works
today, except:
1) Nova creates an OVS bridge instead of a linux bridge (i.e. qbr) to
   attach the tap interface to.
2) Nova connects that bridge to the OVS integration bridge using a patch
   port pair instead of a veth pair.

By using an OVS bridge instead of a linux bridge as the tap interface
attach point, Neutron will be able to create additional patch port pairs
between the trunk bridge and the integration bridge with specific vlan
tags used to mux/demux vlan-tagged traffic to/from the VM and thereby
implement vlan-aware VMs functionality.

The responsibility of creating the OVS ""trunk"" bridge and connecting it
to the integration bridge via patch ports is left to Nova rather than
Neutron because it simplifies the overall work flow between
Nova/Neutron, similar to the reason why Nova is responsible for creating
the Linux bridge and veth pair in the ovs_hybrid strategy.

NOTE: as Nova is currently working towards integration with the os-vif
library (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/269672/), this patch (and
follow-ups) will most likely be merged to os-vif rather than Nova,
but feel free to add feedback to this patch (and follow-ups) until it's
ported to os-vif.

This patch only provides the initial plugging-related methods for VIFs
of the type ovs_trunk. Further dependent patches will drive the logic of
how these methods are actually called, based upon details in the VIF
object.

This patch builds upon the OVS trunk bridge plugging provided in an
earlier patch for VIF_TYPE_OVS to provide similar functionality for
VIF_TYPE_VHOSTUSER (for OVS-DPDK).

The vhost-user vif will be attached to the OVS trunk bridge that
is connected to the OVS integration bridge via a patch port pair.

This patch only provides the initial plugging-related method
implementations; a follow-on patch will provide the logic around how a
VIF is determined to be a vhost-user trunk in order to call the
appropriate plug methods.

NOTE: as mentioned in the parent patch, Nova is currently working
towards integration of the os-vif library, so this patch would likely
merge in os-vif rather than in Nova. Feel free to leave feedback on this
patch anyways.

Application to current projects =============================== .. tagged-projects:: type:horizon-plugin Rationale ========= On the releases publication website there are a number of deliverables that do not qualify to be a service or a library. Some of those are really corner cases, but a lot of them happen to be Horizon plugins, using a combination of 'ui' or 'dashboard' or 'horizon' prefixes or suffixes. Using this tag will help users quickly identify which deliverables provide this companion functionality, and to display them in their own category on the releases publication website. Requirements ============ * The repository contains code meant to be dynamically loaded by OpenStack Horizon to provide UI to specific projects. Tag application process ======================= Anyone may propose adding or removing this tag to a set of projects by proposing a change to the openstack/governance repository. The change is reviewed by the Release Team and Technical Committee and approved using standard resolution approval rules, including discussion at at least one Technical Committee public IRC meeting. Deprecation =========== There is no deprecation process for tags in the ``type`` namespace. If we need to change the type of a project, we can just do that. ",,75,1

Without an overlay network enabled, the Neutron play will fail to set
_local_ip due to _overlay_network being an empty dict.

Example:
TASK: [set local_ip fact (is_metal)] ******************************************
fatal: [aio1] => One or more undefined variables: 'dict object' has no attribute 'bridge'

An undefined overlay network is appropriate for deployments where an
overlay network is not used or supported by the selected Neutron plugin.

The Neutron playbook will now accommodate this deployment scenario
without a hard failure due to the undefined variable.

Problem description =================== It is not possible to combine both volume force delete and cascade delete. It is also difficult to add more parameters to volume delete, since they have to interact in a reasonable way with things like os-force-delete, which is part of volume delete from a user's point of view, but not the same API action. Use Cases ========= This makes it easier to delete a volume which may be in an odd state. It also simplifies our API by passing optional parameters to delete rather than separate action calls. This allows us to combine the parameters in meaningful ways (force + cascade), as well as extend the same combinations to snapshot-delete, cg-delete, etc., without having to make X delete API actions for each parameter. (eg. os-force-delete, os-force-delete-snapshot, os-force-delete-cg, etc.) Also consider if we wish to add the option later to delete an attached volume with a ""force-detach"" parameter, etc. This also should reduce the number of cases where an admin/user needs to use reset-state operations. Proposed change =============== Deprecate use of os-force-delete and make ""force"" a parameter passed to volume delete like ""cascade"" is. The ability to default ""force"" to be an admin-only operation via config will be maintained. Alternatives ------------ Change nothing. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- * New boolean ""force"" parameter for volume delete, which defaults to False. This will behave the same as os-force-delete if not combined with other arguments. If combined with cascade, a cascade delete which ignores the volume and snapshot states will be performed. Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- $ cinder delete --force --cascade <volume> will be accepted. This gives a ""delete this volume regardless of the state of things"" operation which does not exist today. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: eharney Work Items ---------- * Add ""force"" as a parameter to volume delete API * Add logic to handle combination of force and cascade * (eventually) remove os-force-delete with a new API microversion * Look at what to do, if anything, in this same regard for ""unmanage"", e.g., ""unmanage --cascade"". Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= New tempest test for volume delete which uses the parameterized version rather than os-force-delete. Tempest test for cascade + force volume delete. Documentation Impact ==================== New arguments for cinderclient volume delete. References ========== * Cascade delete https://review.openstack.org/#/c/201748/ ",,154,0

This document lists those ""house rules"" for reference. Typo fixes ---------- When the change fixes content that is obviously wrong (updates a PTL email address, fixes a typo...) then the chair is allowed to directly approve them. Code changes ------------ The `openstack/governance` repository also contains code to build and publish pages on the governance.openstack.org website. For those we apply the normal code review rules (with RollCall votes being considered +-2): change will be approved once 2 `RollCall+1` (other than the change owner) are posted (and no `RollCall-1`). Delegated tags -------------- Some tags are delegated to a specific team, like :ref:`tag-stable:follows-policy`, :ref:`tag-release:cycle-with-intermediary` or :ref:`tag-vulnerability:managed`. Those need to get approved by the corresponding team PTL, and can be directly approved by the chair once this approval is given. Other project team updates -------------------------- For other changes within an existing project team, like addition of a new git repository or self-assertion of a tag, we use lazy consensus. If there is no objection posted one week after the change is proposed (or a significant new revision of the change is posted), then the change can be approved by the chair. One exception to this would be significant team mission statement changes, which should be approved by a formal vote after an in-meeting discussion. In corner cases where the change is time-sensitive (like a deliverable reorganization which blocks a release request), the chair may fast-track the change, but should report on that exception at the next TC meeting. Rolling back fast-tracked changes --------------------------------- As a safety net, if any member disagrees with any change that was fast-tracked under one of those house rules, that member can propose a revert of the change. Such revert should be directly approved by the chair and the change be put on the agenda of the next TC meeting for further discussion. ",,57,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ======================================================= Add attributes about volume connection into nodes table ======================================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ironic/+spec/template This blueprint adds two new attributes 'volume_initiator_info' and 'volume_target_info' to node table. With this feature, Nova can get initiator information of a bare metal node and ask Cinder to connect a volume to the node. Problem description =================== When user starts bare metal instance with cinder volume, nova orchestrates the communication with Cinder and Ironic. The work flow in boot process is like following: * User asks Nova to boot a node with a cinder volume * Nova calls ironic to collect iSCSI/FC initiator information -(a) * Ironic collect initiator information and return it to Nova * Nova calls Cinder to attach the volume to the node * Cinder attaches the volume to the node and returns connection information which includes target information * Nova calls Ironic to set target information -(b) * Nova calls Ironic to spawn a instance * If the node boots from volume, Ironic asks BIOS to boot from SAN * Ironic turns on the node In the work flow above, Nova calls Ironic to get/set initiator/target information ((a) and (b)) but currently Ironic has neither those information nor APIs for them. Proposed change =============== * Add a new attribute `volume_initiator_info` in nodes table. This attribute contains iSCSI/FC initiator information like following: * wwnn (list of world wide node names for the initiator) * wwpn (list of world wide port names for the initiator) * iqn * ip (for iSCSI initiator port) * Add a new attribute `volume_target_info` in nodes table. This attribute contains iSCSI/FC target information like following: * target_iqn * target_lun * target_portal * ip * port * auth_method * auth_username * auth_password * target_wwn Alternatives ------------ Saving these informations in a new table named volume_connection_info and adding new API to set/get those informations. Data model impact ----------------- Add two new attributes `volume_initiator_info` and `volume_target_info` in `node` table. Those field are json dict. State Machine Impact -------------------- None. REST API impact --------------- Two new attributes `volume_initiator_info` and `volume_target_info` will be added to the Node resource. Client (CLI) impact ------------------- None. RPC API impact -------------- None. Driver API impact ----------------- None. Nova driver impact ------------------ When preparing the node with cinder volume, the Nova driver gets initiator information from node resources. In addition to that, the Nova driver updates volume target information which Cinder returns when it spawns an instance. Security impact --------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Scalability impact ------------------ None. Performance Impact ------------------ This may extend the time required for nova boot/delete, but it's not a big impact and it's important for enterprise users. Other deployer impact --------------------- The following initiator fields are required while enrolling node into ironic: * iSCSI: * ip * iqn * FC: * wwnn * wwpn Developer impact ---------------- jroll proposed ""Ironic: block storage support""[1]_ for nova ironic driver and that is meant for in-band use. The solution this spec proposes can be used for both in-band and out-of-band control basically, but need some updates for in-band use, e.g. where/how to create iqn etc. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: satoru-moriya-br Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Create `volume_initiator_info` and `volume_target_info` field in the nodes table in the database. * Create new attributes `volume_initiator_info` and `volume_target_info` in the Node object. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= * unit tests will be added/updated to cover the changes. * Tempest tests will be added to Ironic to ensure that the new /nodes/<uuid>/initiator and /nodes/<uuid>/target is working properly. Upgrades and Backwards Compatibility ==================================== Add a migration script for DB. Documentation Impact ==================== Developer documentation should be updated to explain new interface. References ========== .. [1] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/184652/ ..

We have started hitting the deploy timeout pretty regularly in the

While adding new 'Security Group Rule' viz. 'Custom ICMP rule' when
wrong ICMP 'type' or 'code' was given the errors it would show were
'Not a valid port number'; which is misleading. The errors should
rather be 'Not a valid ICMP type' or 'Not a valid ICMP code'.

Also for validating ICMP 'type' and 'code' there wasn't any dedicated
functionality in 'oslo.utils/netutils' so the code for validating 'TCP
ports' was used. TCP ports are in range 0 to 65535 while ICMP 'type'
and 'code' are in range 0 to 255, so using 'TCP port validation' code
is incorrect.

When -1 is used in 'ICMP code' or 'ICMP type' that means any number
0 to 255 is valid.

Here newer dedicated functionality of 'oslo.utils/netutils' is used
for validating ICMP 'type' and ICMP 'code'.
