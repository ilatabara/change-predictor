This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================================= Implement RESERVED_HOST recovery action for host failure workflow ================================================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/masakari/+spec/implement-recovery-methods This spec talks about adding RESERVED_HOST recovery action for host failure workflow. In masakari each failover segment has recovery_method defined for it, so that if any of the host within that failover segment goes down then recovery action will be executed to evacuate all instances from that host based on recovery_method. What is RESERVED_HOST? In each failover segment operators will keep some hosts as reserved by disabling the compute service on those hosts and setting ""reserved"" property of that host as ""True"". As a result, these hosts are not selected by the nova scheduler while provisioning new instances or for performing any other instance actions such as resize, migration etc. These hosts can be used by masakari engine for evacuating the instances from the failed host. Once the reserved host is used for evacuating the instances it is no longer treated as reserved and nova scheduler can use that host for scheduling the instances. Problem description =================== Masakari provides a driver interface for implementing the workflows synchronously or asynchronously. Whoever wants to implement the workflow can inherit the masakari driver and implement the workflows. For implementing the RESERVED_HOST recovery action masakari engine should provide list of reserved hosts associated with its failover segment to the driver. Its then job of the driver to execute the workflow and use this list for evacuating the instances from failed host. Once workflow execution is finished masakari engine needs to set the ""reserved"" property of the hosts from the reserved hosts list which are used for evacuating the instances to indicate that this host is no longer treated as reserved host. As of now current supported driver (taskflow) runs synchronously on the local machine where engine is running. So we can convert the reserved host objects from reserved hosts list into dictionary and pass it to taskflow driver as a input. In taskflow execution, when the reserved host is taken for evacuation, it will set the ""reserved"" property of that host as ""False"". As the dictionary is mutable, masakari-engine will get the updated dictionary after the execution of workflow. Once taskflow execution finished, we can iterate over the updated dictionary and update the host in the database whose ""reserved"" property is marked as ""False"" in the dictionary. But in future any one can contribute new driver and it's not guaranteed that it will execute synchronously or asynchronously i.e. it will return a result or not. If this new driver executes the workflow asynchronously then masakari engine will fail to set the reserved host as False which are used for evacuation, as well as will fail to update the actual notification status. Use Cases --------- Operator may want to execute host_failure workflow using 'RESERVED_HOST' recovery method. Proposed change =============== Masakari engine should execute the workflows synchronously only. Masakari engine will load all the drivers. Whoever is going to implement the new driver, it should be the responsibility of that driver to get the result of workflow and send it back to the masakari engine. If someone wants to add a driver which will execute the workflow on a different host and not on the same host where masakari engine is running then they will need to design that driver in such a way that workflow will execute on any host in asynchronous way and send back the result to the masakari engine, so that masakari engine will set the notification status to ""ERROR"" or ""FINISHED"" and set the reserved hosts to False based on those results. Pros: ----- 1. No need to change current masakari engine implementation. 2. It's easy to implement other recovery actions such as ""AUTO_PRIORITY"" and ""RH_PRIORITY"" with this design. Alternatives ------------ Execute the workflows asynchronously i.e. either workflow can be executed on same host where masakari engine is running or on a different host altogether. In this case masakari engine might not get the results from the workflow execution and will not able to update notification status and set reserved hosts to False. To achieve this we need to add a new database table which will store 'x-openstack-request-id' and 'notification_uuid'. When a notification is received by masakari engine, it will create a request_id, stores it against that notification_uuid in the new table. Then masakari engine will generate a callback URL based on that request_id and pass it to the driver. Sample callback URL will be like, http://<host>:<port>/v1/notification_request_mapping/<request_id> Driver will further pass this URL and the required information such as reserved host list, host name etc. to the workflow. Workflow will be responsible to call the masakari using callback URL with notification status and reserved hosts used by workflow as a body of the request. Once this request is received by masakari, then based on the request_id it will map it to the notification from the new database table and update the status of the notification accordingly. Also masakari will get the list of used reserved hosts in request body, so it will loop through it and set those host's ""reserved"" property as False. New lookup table:: CREATE TABLE notification_request_mapping ( id INT NOT NULL, request_id varchar(36) NOT NULL, notification_uuid varchar(36) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id), ); Rest API can be:: method: PUT URL: URL that is passed to the workflow(contains request_id) Body: result { notification_status: status of the notification, either 'error' or 'finished', used_reserved_hosts: list of actually used reserved_hosts by workflow } Cons: ----- 1. The other service which is going to request masakari using REST api should have required admin credentials to call the API. 2. Need to change current driver (taskflow) implementation to adopt this design. 3. Additional REST call and new database api's along with new table needs to be added. 4. Need to add new resource ""notification_request_mapping"" for handling PUT call.

We should allow the case where the keys collide, but the
replacement is the same as the current key (e.g a noop).

This is useful when you want to do a map_replace based on a
user parameter, then the default can be to do a noop replace
but the user parameter may also be any other (non colliding)

1. What is the problem
(1) Currently we only add bridge mapping for br-extern in RegionTwo by
default in plugin.sh, so if we only have one node for the tempest
test, we can not test the cases that network is created in physical
network of ""extern"".
(2) Keystone url is not configured explicitly in tricircle local
Neutron plugin configuration so local Neutron plugin may fail to connect
to central Neutron.
(3) In multi-pod installation, Nova services in node2 fail to talk to
placement API due to placement API configuration problem, which leads
to instance booting error.

2. What is the solution to the problem
(1) Add bridge mapping for br-extern both in RegionOne and RegionTwo
by default.
(2) Configure two options client.identity_url and client.auth_url in
plugin.sh to make sure local Neutron server can correctly connect to
central Neutron server.
(3) Update multi-pod installation guide to add a workaround for the
placement API problem.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle
No new features.

In auditing our proxy method names heading into the 1.0 release,
where we'll need to be more careful about backwards compatibility,
some names in the cluster proxy use structures that are different than
we're using both around the other services and also within cluster
itself. We've converged on several naming formats for add/remove,
attach/detach, and several other grammar styles when naming operations
that are done on a certain resource.

This change introduces a deprecation decorator using the `deprecation`
library, which was recently added to global-requirements. This is also
the first change of several in the auditing process, just going
alphabetical order through the services.

The plan with these is that they're marked for deprecation in the
next release (0.9.14), both here in the code and in the documentation
via the deprecation library's ability to modify the docstring, which
then shows up in our built documentation. In the meantime, we should
help any users we know of—in this case we have cluster developers on
this project—in updating calling code to use the newer format before
1.0 happens.

The following deprecations were made:
* cluster_add_nodes -> add_nodes_to_cluster
* cluster_del_nodes -> remove_nodes_from_cluster
* cluster_replace_nodes -> replace_nodes_in_cluster
* cluster_scale_out -> scale_out_cluster
* cluster_scale_in -> scale_in_cluster
* cluster_attach_policy -> attach_policy_to_cluster
* cluster_detach_policy -> detach_policy_from_cluster
* cluster_update_policy -> update_cluster_policy
* cluster_operation -> perform_operation_on_cluster
* node_operation -> perform_operation_on_node

Don't create a resource record for backup stack if the
resource record exists, just to migrate it to backup
stack, to avoid redundant data remaining for existing
stack.

This patch also adds resource.store() which covers
_store() and _store_or_update() implemention. And then
we can delete the two methods.

A new nova driver will be implemented. Additional OpenStack functionality beyond initial Nova support is not part of this blueprint; we will have specific additional blueprints for that, as needed. A 3rd party Continuous Integration environment for OpenStack for DPM on System z will be established and maintained by IBM. Problem description =================== On IBM z Systems, certain workloads run better in a logical partition than in a virtual machine of a software hypervisor such as KVM or z/VM. The IBM z13 system (and IBM LinuxONE) introduced a new administrative mode named ""Dynamic Partition Manager"" (DPM) that allows for managing the firmware-based logical partition hypervisor (PR/SM) with the dynamic capabilities known from software-based hypervisors. These new dynamic capabilities provided by the DPM mode enables PR/SM to act as a hypervisor managed by OpenStack using Nova. This blueprint proposes to support the PR/SM hypervisor in DPM mode as a Nova hypervisor platform, by implementing a new Nova driver. The other hypervisors on z Systems such as z/VM and KVM are already supported by OpenStack via Nova drivers. These drivers will continue to be supported. Adding support for PR/SM DPM allows addressing customers that need or want to run their workloads in logical partitions, and provides the advantage for them of using OpenStack as a uniform, standard, cloud management platform on z Systems. Use Cases --------- End user or cloud tooling platforms will be able to use OpenStack nova driver to create partitions, start partitions with a supported s390x image, modify partitions, stop partitions, and delete partitions on top of IBM System z PR/SM hypervisor in DPM mode. Proposed change =============== We will be implementing a new nova driver, and more details are being worked upon. The nova driver will be implementd using the zhmcclient python library for interactions with the System z Hardware Management Console. Posting to get preliminary feedback on the scope of this spec. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- The config options specific to the IBM DPM nova driver will be provided in nova/conf/dpm.py. Detailed documentation will be provided about the new config options. Developer impact ---------------- None (Changes will not affect other nova hypervisor platforms) Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: sreeram-vancheeswaran Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- Details are being worked out and will be added regularly Posting to get preliminary feedback on the scope of this spec. Testing ======= Unit test - Existing Nova unit tests should suffice for the generic bits of Nova. Additional Nova unit tests for DPM specific behaviours will be written. 3rd party CI - 3rd party CI environment for DPM on Systemz will be set up and run by by IBM, to run full tempest tests. Documentation Impact ==================== As per prelimineray investigation, there will be changes to nova config options for supporting specific parameters for DPM hypervisor. Doc changes for the platform will be made as needed (details are to be determined). A quick start guide will also be provided which will explain how a OpenStack cloud need to be configured to use the PR/SM hypervisor in DPM mode.

Instead of running tests with nosetests,
this commit migrates tox.ini to use ostestr
similar to other openstack projects.

Using ostestr, as well testrepository, results
in another useful feature where test results can be
seen in convenient graphical representation.

Additionally:
* added oslo_debug_helper
* extracted unit-like dependencies into external testenv,
that way they are not installed for target where
they are actually not required (like pep8)
* removed testenv:docs because monasca does not come
with sphinx documentation
* removed testenv:genconfig because monasca is not
compatible with supplying its entire configuration
they way oslo-config-generator expects

If user has enabled “monkey_patch” config option and kept the default
“monkey_patch_modules” config option as is, then service gives
ValueError at the time of starting itself. The default value given to
the “monkey_patch_modules” config option is not according to the format

This patch fixes this issue by making monkey_patch_modules's correct
default value and if user wants to apply monkey patching then syntax
must be correct so handled that value error.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =================== Debugger for Murano =================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/murano/+spec/muranopl-debugger Currently Murano ecosystem has lack of debugging tool. Debugger allows newcomers to figure out how things works inside Murano service and makes easier for experienced developers to find hidden bugs in complex applications. Problem description =================== Now it is not possible to get access to context of application in deploying state. So, application developer should understand well how MuranoPL code works in order to write complex Murano app. Only one way is how to find that something went wrong it is to look through the logs from deployed application. To increase development speed it is necessary to have a tool which can join to running deployment and execute MuranoPL code inside of deployment context. List of usecases should be covered by Murano debugger: * User should be able to connect to murano-engine reached breakpoint statement * User should be able to explore execution context in the breakpoint * User should be able to control following execution process * User should be able to execute YAQL statements in current execution context Proposed change =============== Debugger will be implemented as a script in the murano code base. So, user can get access to Murano node and run debugger there. Debugger should have interactive shell to communicate with user. While debugger is running it will automatically join to any murano engine reached special breakpoint statement. As breakpoint statement MuranoPL will use special function `set_trace`. Also it should be possible to trigger deployment in debug mode, it this case execution will stuck on breakpoint before execution the very first MuranoPL statement. As soon as execution process reached breakpoint it should try to establish connection with Murano debugger using RPC. It it fails on timeout, it be logged and execution continues. If executor joins to debugger, it should block current green thread, switch context and wait for following instructions. Debugger should be able to connect to multiple debug sessions and switch between them. It allows to debug MuranoPL statements launched in parallel mode. It this case one breakpoint inside `Parallel` block will generate several debug sessions, one per green thread. Outside debug session user sloud be able to list all active sessions and join to the specified one. Inside debug session debugger provide to user 'pdb' like interface. List of suggested commands: * help * exit * continue * next * where * list * print * step * context * up * down * exec * break * clear Alternatives ------------ Instead of implementing debugger, current procedure of debugging Murano applications can be described in the official Murano documentation.

Murano Core library should be able to operate with Neutron ports directly. If will enable to deploy more complicated network topologies and chains of network appliances. Problem description =================== Right now only NeutronNetwork presents network stack in Murano Core library. This approach works for lots of applications, but it has some limitations. The main of then is that Murano can not create a server with a few connections to the same network. This limitation makes difficult to develop NFV oriented applications. Also now in Murano we don't have ability to operate with Neutron ports directly. It makes difficult to deploy complicated network topologies and also it creates an obstacles to create NFV applications in Murano. Proposed change =============== - Introduce NeutronPort resource in Murano Core library. It it will reflect functionality of Heat's resource OS::Neutron::Port. It should be able to create NeutronPort in given network and attach Instance to it. Also, it should be able to get list of Ports from Networks and list of Ports attached to given Instance. - Refactor Murano Core library to include NeutronPort class into current networking flows, like join Instance to NeutronNetwork. It affects such classes, like NeutronNetwork, Instance, SharedIp, etc. Backward compatibility of existed classes API should be keep.

The initial implementation was measuring the bandwidth stability
over segments of time. But recent failures on high gate pressure
has shown that such stability can't be expected on the edge.

The test now checks the average bandwidth during the whole transmission.

Instead of running tests with nosetests,
this commit migrates tox.ini to use ostestr
similar to other openstack projects.

Using ostestr, as well testrepository, results
in another useful feature where test results can be
seen in convenient graphical representation.

Additionally:
* added oslo_debug_helper
* extracted unit-like dependencies into external testenv,
that way they are not installed for target where
they are actually not required (like pep8)
* removed testenv:docs because monasca does not come
with sphinx documentation
* removed testenv:genconfig because monasca is not
compatible with supplying its entire configuration

The handoffs_first mode in the replicator has the useful behavior of
processing all handoff parts across all disks until there aren't any
handoffs anymore on the node [1] and then it seemingly tries to drop
back into normal operation.  In practice I've only ever heard of
handoffs_first used while rebalancing and turned off as soon as the
rebalance finishes - it's not recommended to run with handoffs_first
mode turned on and it emits a warning on startup if option is enabled.

The handoffs_first mode on the reconstructor doesn't work - it was
prioritizing handoffs *per-part* [2] - which is really unfortunate
because in the reconstructor during a rebalance it's often *much* more
attractive from an efficiency disk/network perspective to revert a
partition from a handoff than it is to rebuild an entire partition from
another primary using the other EC fragments in the cluster.

This change deprecates handoffs_first in favor of handoffs_only in the
reconstructor which is far more useful - and just like handoffs_first
mode in the replicator - it gives the operator the option of forcing the
consistency engine to focus on rebalance.  The handoffs_only behavior is
somewhat consistent with the replicator's handoffs_first option (any
error on any handoff in the replicactor will make it essentially handoff
only forever) but the option does what you want and is named correctly
in the reconstructor.

For consistency with the replicator the reconstructor will mostly honor
the handoffs_first option, but if you set handoffs_only in the config it
always takes precedence.  Having handoffs_first in your config always
results in a warning, but if handoff_only is not set and handoffs_first
is true the reconstructor will assume you need handoffs_only and behaves
as such.

When running in handoffs_only mode the reconstructor will start to log a
warning every cycle if you leave it running in handoffs_only after it
finishes reverting handoffs.  However you should be monitoring on-disk
partitions and disable the option as soon as the cluster finishes the
full rebalance cycle.

2. Unlike replication each partition in a EC policy can have a different
kind of job per frag_index, but the cardinality of jobs is typically

different fragments.

1. What is the problem
The current implementation of ""get_pod_by_top_id"" method uses a
hard-coded ""RT_VOLUME"" value to pass to ""get_bottom_mappings_by_top_id""
method as the ""resource_type"" parameter, however ""RT_VOLUME"" no longer

Considering that resource ID will not be reused, this patch rewrites the
logic to only query resource routing entries by resource ID. Also this

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle

Problem 1: The tenant docker image name is built from the its project id
in Keystone. While the Swift side was looking for the id prefix, the
ansible scripts built an image name containing the whole id.

Problem 2: The ansible scripts deduced the image name from doing

This commit adds flake8-import-order to global-requirements.txt. With
this library, we can check whether imports order is along with the
hacking import order template[1] automatically.

Of course, we can check import orders by manual. However it is not fun
and we sometimes mistake. And we have H306 rule for checking import
orders but it only checks alphabetic order not for stdlibs or not.

live_migration_progress_timeout aims to timeout a live-migration well
before the live_migration_completion_timeout limit, by looking for when
it appears that no progress has been made copying the memory between the
hosts. However, it turns out there are several problems with the way we
monitor progress. In production, and stress testing, having
live_migration_progress_timeout > 0 has caused random timeout failures
for live-migrations that take longer than live_migration_progress_timeout

One problem is that block_migrations appear to show no progress, as it
seems we only look for progress in copying memory. Also the way we query
QEMU via libvirt breaks when there are multiple iterations of memory
copying.

We need to revisit this bug and either fix the progress mechanism or
remove the all the code that checks for the progress (including the
automatic trigger for post-copy). But in the mean time, lets default to
having no timeout, and warn users that have overridden this
configuration by deprecating the live_migration_progress_timeout
configuration option.

For users concerned about live-migration timeout errors, I have
cleaned up the configuration option descriptions, so they have a better
chance of stopping the live-migration timeout errors they may come
across.

The initial value of 5 concurrent testenv creations was based on an

A single paragraph of prose that operators can understand. Some notes about using this template: * Your spec should be in ReSTructured text, like this template. * Please wrap text at 80 columns. * The filename in the git repository should match the launchpad URL, for example a URL of: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tacker/+spec/awesome-thing should be named awesome-thing.rst * Please do not delete any of the sections in this template. If you have nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None * For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html * To test out your formatting, build the docs using tox, or see: http://rst.ninjs.org * If you would like to provide a diagram with your spec, text representations are preferred. http://asciiflow.com/ is a very nice tool to assist with making ascii diagrams. blockdiag is another tool. These are described below. If you require an image (screenshot) for your BP, attaching that to the BP and checking it in is also accepted. However, text representations are prefered. * Diagram examples asciiflow:: +----------+ +-----------+ +----------+ | A | | B | | C | | +-----+ +--------+ | +----------+ +-----------+ +----------+ blockdiag .. blockdiag:: blockdiag sample { a -> b -> c; } actdiag .. actdiag:: actdiag { write -> convert -> image lane user { label = ""User"" write [label = ""Writing reST""]; image [label = ""Get diagram IMAGE""]; } lane actdiag { convert [label = ""Convert reST to Image""]; } } nwdiag .. nwdiag:: nwdiag { network dmz { address = ""210.x.x.x/24"" web01 [address = ""210.x.x.1""]; web02 [address = ""210.x.x.2""]; } network internal { address = ""172.x.x.x/24""; web01 [address = ""172.x.x.1""]; web02 [address = ""172.x.x.2""]; db01; db02; } } seqdiag .. seqdiag:: seqdiag { browser -> webserver [label = ""GET /index.html""]; browser <-- webserver; browser -> webserver [label = ""POST /blog/comment""]; webserver -> database [label = ""INSERT comment""]; webserver <-- database; browser <-- webserver; } Problem description =================== A detailed description of the problem: * For a new feature this might be use cases. Ensure you are clear about the actors in each use case: End User vs Deployer * For a major reworking of something existing it would describe the problems in that feature that are being addressed. Proposed change =============== Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How do you propose to solve this problem? If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In other words, what's the scope of this effort? Alternatives ------------ What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one. Data model impact ----------------- Changes which require modifications to the data model often have a wider impact on the system. The community often has strong opinions on how the data model should be evolved, from both a functional and performance perspective. It is therefore important to capture and gain agreement as early as possible on any proposed changes to the data model. Questions which need to be addressed by this section include: * What new data objects and/or database schema changes is this going to require? * What database migrations will accompany this change. * How will the initial set of new data objects be generated, for example if you need to take into account existing instances, or modify other existing data describe how that will work. REST API impact --------------- For each API resource to be implemented using Tacker's attribute map facility (see the tacker.api.v2.attributes), describe the resource collection and specify the name, type, and other essential details of each new or modified attribute. A table similar to the following may be used: +----------+-------+---------+---------+------------+--------------+ |Attribute |Type |Access |Default |Validation/ |Description | |Name | | |Value |Conversion | | +==========+=======+=========+=========+============+==============+ |id |string |RO, all |generated|N/A |identity | | |(UUID) | | | | | +----------+-------+---------+---------+------------+--------------+ |name |string |RW, all |'' |string |human-readable| | | | | | |name | +----------+-------+---------+---------+------------+--------------+ |color |string |RW, admin|'red' |'red', |color | | | | | |'yellow', or|indicating | | | | | |'green' |state | +----------+-------+---------+---------+------------+--------------+ Here is the other example of the table using csv-table .. csv-table:: CSVTable :header: Attribute Name,Type,Access,Default Value,Validation Conversion,Description id,string (UUID),""RO, all"",generated,N/A,identity name,string,""RW, all"",""''"",string,human-readable name color,string,""RW, admin"",red,""'red', 'yellow' or 'green'"",color indicating state Each API method which is either added or changed that does not use Tacker's attribute map facility should have the following: * Specification for the method * A description of what the method does suitable for use in user documentation * Method type (POST/PUT/GET/DELETE) * Normal http response code(s) * Expected error http response code(s) * A description for each possible error code should be included describing semantic errors which can cause it such as inconsistent parameters supplied to the method, or when an instance is not in an appropriate state for the request to succeed. Errors caused by syntactic problems covered by the JSON schema defintion do not need to be included. * URL for the resource * Parameters which can be passed via the url * JSON schema definition for the body data if allowed * JSON schema definition for the response data if any * Example use case including typical API samples for both data supplied by the caller and the response * Discuss any API policy changes, and discuss what things a deployer needs to think about when defining their API policy. This is in reference to the policy.json file. Note that the schema should be defined as restrictively as possible. Parameters which are required should be marked as such and only under exceptional circumstances should additional parameters which are not defined in the schema be permitted (eg additionaProperties should be False). Reuse of existing predefined parameter types such as regexps for passwords and user defined names is highly encouraged. Security impact --------------- Describe any potential security impact on the system. Some of the items to consider include: * Does this change touch sensitive data such as tokens, keys, or user data? * Does this change alter the API in a way that may impact security, such as a new way to access sensitive information or a new way to login? * Does this change involve cryptography or hashing? * Does this change require the use of sudo or any elevated privileges? * Does this change involve using or parsing user-provided data? This could be directly at the API level or indirectly such as changes to a cache layer. * Can this change enable a resource exhaustion attack, such as allowing a single API interaction to consume significant server resources? Some examples of this include launching subprocesses for each connection, or entity expansion attacks in XML. For more detailed guidance, please see the OpenStack Security Guidelines as a reference (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/Guidelines). These guidelines are a work in progress and are designed to help you identify security best practices. For further information, feel free to reach out to the OpenStack Security Group at openstack-security@lists.openstack.org. Notifications impact -------------------- Please specify any changes to notifications. Be that an extra notification, changes to an existing notification, or removing a notification. Other end user impact --------------------- Aside from the API, are there other ways a user will interact with this feature? * Does this change have an impact on python-tackerclient? What does the user interface there look like? Performance Impact ------------------ Describe any potential performance impact on the system, for example how often will new code be called, and is there a major change to the calling pattern of existing code. Examples of things to consider here include: * A periodic task might look like a small addition but if it calls conductor or another service the load is multiplied by the number of nodes in the system. * A small change in a utility function or a commonly used decorator can have a large impacts on performance. * Calls which result in a database queries (whether direct or via conductor) can have a profound impact on performance when called in critical sections of the code. * Will the change include any locking, and if so what considerations are there on holding the lock? Other deployer impact --------------------- Discuss things that will affect how you deploy and configure OpenStack that have not already been mentioned, such as: * What config options are being added? Should they be more generic than proposed (for example a flag that other hypervisor drivers might want to implement as well)? Are the default values ones which will work well in real deployments? * Is this a change that takes immediate effect after its merged, or is it something that has to be explicitly enabled? * If this change is a new binary, how would it be deployed? * Please state anything that those doing continuous deployment, or those upgrading from the previous release, need to be aware of. Also describe any plans to deprecate configuration values or features. For example, if we change the directory name that instances are stored in, how do we handle instance directories created before the change landed? Do we move them? Do we have a special case in the code? Do we assume that the operator will recreate all the instances in their cloud? Developer impact ---------------- Discuss things that will affect other developers working on OpenStack, such as: * If the blueprint proposes a change to the API, discussion of how other plugins would implement the feature is required. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: <launchpad-id or None> Other contributors: <launchpad-id or None> Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Apart from the main functionality, the developer needs to deliver the following work items as part of any major blueprint: * Unit Tests * Functional Tests * Feature documentation in doc/source/devref/feature NOTE: This feature documentation should be treated like code. Preferably this should be included in the primary patchset itself and not as an afterthought. This is also mandatory for a blueprint to be marked complete. Dependencies ============ * Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in tacker, or in other projects, that this one either depends on or is related to. * If this requires functionality of another project that is not currently used by Tacker (such as the glance v2 API when we previously only required v1), document that fact. * Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not included in OpenStack? Or does it depend on a specific version of library? Testing ======= Please discuss how the change will be tested. We especially want to know what tempest tests will be added. It is assumed that unit test coverage will be added so that doesn't need to be mentioned explicitly, but discussion of why you think unit tests are sufficient and we don't need to add more tempest tests would need to be included. Is this untestable in gate given current limitations (specific hardware / software configurations available)? If so, are there mitigation plans (3rd party testing, gate enhancements, etc). Documentation Impact ==================== What is the impact on the docs team of this change? Some changes might require donating resources to the docs team to have the documentation updated. Don't repeat details discussed above, but please reference them here. References ========== Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any reference. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are: * Links to mailing list or IRC discussions * Links to notes from a summit session * Links to relevant research, if appropriate * Related specifications as appropriate (e.g. link any vendor documentation) * Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to ",,437,0

Community there is a concerted effort to organize an official python

that is a member of the agent object to get IPs that need to be
preserved in the gateway port. Without this change, signatures of the
methods external_gateway_added() and external_gateway_updated() have
to be modified to pass in the agent object. And any subclass of
RouterInfo that overwrites or uses the methods must be changed as
well. It doesn't seem to make sense considering the subclass such as
HaRouter has the agent object as one of its members already.

The changeset fixes the bugs by preserving the LLAs for prefix
delegation when the gateway port is being updated.

Sync charmhelpers and add configuration option to allow access
to ceph pools to be limited based on grouping.

The radosgw will only require access to pools in the 'objects'
group - which probably won't be shared with other services,
but does ensure that compromise on a radosgw unit does not
allow access to volumes and instances on the same underlying
ceph backend.

Added creation of .rgw.root pool to broker requests to ensure
that all pools are added to the 'objects' group, avoiding the
need for rw permissionson the radosgw.gateway key.

OpenStack components *may* therefore leverage advanced features exposed by those base services without fear of increasing the overall operational complexity for OpenStack deployers. Current list of base services ============================= **An oslo.db-compatible database** OpenStack components store data in a database, using oslo.db as an indirection layer. While most OpenStack deployments use MySQL, other databases are supported. **An oslo.messaging-compatible message queue** Some inter-process and inter-service communication in OpenStack components is accomplished using message queues, through oslo.messaging as an indirection layer. While most OpenStack deployments use RabbitMQ, other message queues are supported. **Keystone** OpenStack Keystone handles AuthN/AuthZ for OpenStack components. Deployments can assume that Keystone will be present to perform that role. Process for addition or removal =============================== Leveraging features from a base service (rather than working around limitations or badly reinventing the wheel) is key to reaching acceptable levels of stability, performance and scaling. However, since they will likely have to be deployed in most OpenStack deployments, base services increase the operational complexity of running OpenStack. It is therefore very important to balance those two sides and conservatively consider proposed additions to the base services list, especially when those additions introduce a whole new class of operational challenges. Once services start to make use of advanced features in a base service, it is difficult to remove it from the list and make it a specific dependency instead. Removals from the base service list should therefore be a rare and carefully considered event. Proposed modifications to this document require a formal vote from the Technical Committee membership.

Percona cluster takes some time to fully cluster. The charm was
previously running shared-db-relation-changed hooks whenever they
were queued even if the cluster was not yet complete. This may lead
to split brain scenarios or unexpected behavior.

This change confirms the entire cluster is ready before running
client shared-db-relation-changed hooks.

min-cluster-size can now be used to attempt to guarantee the cluster
is ready with the expected number of nodes. If min-cluster-size is
not set the charm will still determine based on the information
available if all the cluster nodes are ready. Single node
deployments are still possible.

Many of our resources' update methods read the resource from the DB,
joining other tables in some cases, and then do the update using
SQLAlchemy ORM engine before returning updated ORM object.

There are some resources -volume_attachment, snapshot, backup, CG,
CGSnapshot, qos_specs, volume_type, and group_type- that don't care
about the updated ORM object, so we are actually doing unnecessary DB
operations.

This patch removes the unnecessary DB read operations when updating
those resources.

In the case of volume_type and group_type we are also retrieving a DB
entry instead of doing an exists check to check if a name chage is
valid.  This patch also changes that check to the faster exists method.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================================== Add project validation via Keystone to quota and flavor management ================================================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/validate-project-with-keystone When an administrator performs functions on other tenants, they have to specify a project id to identify the tenant. Nova does not currently check the validity of this administrator-provided project id. The scope of this blueprint is to add project id validation to quota management (i.e. quota-defaults, quota-detail, quota-show, quota-update) and to flavor access management (i.e. flavor-access-add). Adding project id validation to any functionality outside of quota and flavor management is beyond the scope of this blueprint. Problem description =================== Nova quota sets management and flavor access management through the CLI require the administrator to specify a project id. Nothing actually checks if this project id actually exists, so a administrator can easily specify an invalid project. If an invalid project id is provided to the quota-update command when updating the quota for a particular quota class, Nova reports unexpected quota information. The project id specified by the user ends up in the project_id field in the entry created in Nova's project_user_quotas table. When the project id does not match what is in the project_user_quotas table, invalid quotas are set. Any function performed on a project that has a quota check will not be affected the way the administrator expects. For instance, if the administrator wants to increase the number of floating ip address for a given project id because that project has used all of its quota, and the wrong project id was provided to quota-update, any attempt to add additional floating ip addresses will unexpectedly fail. Historically, administrators debugging this issue have filed invalid bugs against Nova quota management. Use Cases ---------- As an administrator, when I attempt to modify quota or flavor access information on one of my projects, and I accidentally provide an invalid project id: * I want to know the project id I provided is invalid. * I don't want my existing quota or flavor access data updated when I provide an invalid project id. Proposed change =============== Nova will use the requestor's user token to query Keystone. The Keystone response will determine access to the project and indicate if the project exists. If the requestor passes the authorization check: * if the project exists, they will recieve a 200 response * if the project does not exist, they will receive a 404 response from Keystone, which becomes a 400 response in Nova. If the requestor does not pass the authorization check, they will receive a 403 response indicating they are not authorized to know whether or not the project exists. Because this change is dependent on policy information being set correctly between Keystone and Nova, we need to provide guidance for operators setting this policy. This update will require a release note and a documentation update. API changes will only be made to v2.1; API v2.0 is currently frozen. Alternatives ------------ Status Quo: don't validate the project id and leave it up to the user to figure out the appropriate project id via ""keystone tenant-list"". This will continue to be a poor user experience for end users and the Nova team will continue to field bug reports on inaccurate quotas and flavor access values. Another alternative is to have the python-novaclient validate the project id and expect other clients (e.g. third party) to do the same. This doesn't solve for the problem in Nova itself where invalid project id's end up in the database. It does make sense to have the CLI handle project name verification as this change would only apply to project id verification. An alternative discussed during the cross-project session at the Newton summit was to use the Nova service user token to access the data from Keystone. This was dismissed because it obfuscates what users have access to what resources and could present a potential security risk. Finally, another option explored in the past was simply doing UUID verification. This approach was rejected because we don't require project id's to be UUID's, so valid project id's would be rejected. Data model impact ----------------- None. If any entries exist with the project_id set to an invalid id, they can be deleted using the relevant delete commands. Deletes should not trigger project id validation. REST API impact --------------- Project id validation would create a new error condition for certain API methods. If a Keystone service account exists to validate the project id, and the project id is invalid, the API will return an HTTPBadRequest from the POST and GET requests with error text. The following API methods would be impacted: * quota-defaults * quota-detail * quota-show * quota-update * flavor-access-add Security impact --------------- None. This is using existing authorization mechanisms and doesn't present any new logic. Notifications impact -------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ There will be minor impact to performance. While a request to Keystone is required to validate the project id, it would be a low-frequency operation because quotas/flavor access are not often changed. Other end user impact --------------------- Users will need documentation on how to configure their Keystone and Nova policy to take advantage of this update. An attempt to show existing entries for an invalid project id will result in a 400 error. Future work should provide users with a mechanism for cleaning up bad entries. Other deployer impact --------------------- The quota and flavor operations should not be blocked if either Keystone does not exist or if the Keystone policy is not set up correctly for project id validation. In this case, a warning message should be logged indicating that project id validation is unavailable. This warning should be logged each time for improved visibility to the operator, so they can fix their policy. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: sdague Work Items ---------- * Access the user token via the current context * Implement methods to get the project by a given id. * Modify QuotaSetsController class in nova/api/openstack/compute/quotas.py to validate the project id, if provided. * Modify FlavorActionController class in nova/api/openstack/compute/flavor_access.py to validate the project id, if provided. * Create tempest test cases and Nova unit and functional test cases to verify functionality. * Update the Keystone DocImpact bug with policy examples so the documentation can be updated. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Tempest test cases, as well as Nova unit and functional test cases, will be created to verify project id verification. Tempest test coverage: * Keystone validation * A feature toggle in Tempest to tell it if Keystone is configured properly (in devstack) for the policy to work Commands to be tested with validation: * quota-defaults * quota-detail * quota-show * quota-update * flavor-access-add Test cases for each command: * valid project id - 200 * invalid project id - 400 * user has access to valid project - 200 * user does not have access to valid project - 403 * Keystone is unavailable - log warning Commands to be tested with no validation: * quota-delete * flavor-access-delete Test cases for each command: * pre-existing invalid project id - 200 * new invalid project id - 200 (current behavior) ** a new entry should not be created and then deleted Documentation Impact ==================== None References ========== * Previous proposed code change: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/91866/ * Reported bugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1313935 https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1317515 https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1118066 * Customizing authorization: http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-ops/content/projects_users.html ",,285,281

This patch corrects the project_id handling for POST calls to the
Octavia v1 API.  For load balancer create calls we use the specified
project_id if the user is an admin or noauth is specified.  If no
project_id is specified in the request we use the project_id from
the context.  If no project_id can be found we raise an exception.
For the other object POST methods we use the project_id
from the parent load balancer.

While implementing QoS, we figured out dependency of operation
on network and port can't be completed with existing api, because
QoS policy data does not have networks and ports id which are
attached to it. This patch will add a method which will fetch
all operations on resources in pending or processing state.

So Idea to solve dependency validation for QoS is to fetch all
rows on network and port operations which are in pending or
processing state using method added in this patch and verify
for each row if network data or port data have specific QoS policy
hooked to it.

For dynamic connections it is crucial to close connection
and not to have hanging sockets either we have sent message
successfully or not.

eventlet.green.zmq by default blocks the calling thread on sending message
when connection was not established yet (which is correct DEALER
socket behavior though), but socket cannot be closed when we hang on
sending forever (if we never get the valid host to connect).

eventlet also shields EAGAIN exception in default (blocking) sending mode
so we need to use async zmq.NOBLOCK flag to receive this exception
and hanlde it in our own way to not block forever.

If a deployer has a mirror of uca/rdo, it probably wants to use it.
Defining the URL currently works, but that process wouldn't work if
the mirror is using a different key.

We were reading overcloudrc for the openstack-endpoints validation.
However, the name of tha file may differ if the deployment plan is
called something else than ""overcloud"" and more importantly, the GUI
deployments don't create the file on the undercloud at all.

This updates the Ansible inventory to read the admin password and
keystone url for the specified plan if available and the validation to
use those values instead of relying on overcloudrc.

That means that all services connect directly to each other and all connections are static so we open them at the beginning of service's lifecycle and close them only when service quits. This configuration is the simplest one since it doesn't require any helper services (proxies) other than matchmaker to be running. Matchmaking (mandatory) -----------------------The Matchmaker is pluggable and it provides two different Matchmaker classes.which is 300 (seconds) by default. The option is related not specifically toThe other option is 'zmq_target_update' (180 seconds by default) which specifies how often each RPC-Server should update the matchmaker. This option's optimal value generally is zmq_target_expire / 2 (or 1.5). It is recommended to calculate it based on 'zmq_target_expire' so services records wouldn't expire earlier than being updated from alive services. Generally matchmaker can be considered as an alternate approach to services heartbeating. Matchmaker Data Source (mandatory)Matchmaker data source is stored in files or Redis server discussed in the transport_url = ""zmq+sentinel://host1:26379,host2:26379,host3:26379"" Listening Address (optional) ---------------------------- All services bind to an IP address or Ethernet adapter. By default, all services bind to '*', effectively binding to 0.0.0.0. This may be changed with the option 'rpc_zmq_bind_address' which accepts a wildcard, IP address, or Ethernet adapter. This configuration can be set in [oslo_messaging_zmq] section. For example:: rpc_zmq_bind_address = * Currently zmq driver uses dynamic port binding mechanism, which means that each listener will allocate port of a random number (static, i.e. fixed, ports may only be used for sockets inside proxies now). Ports range is controlled by two options 'rpc_zmq_min_port' and 'rpc_zmq_max_port'. Change them to restrict current service's port binding range. 'rpc_zmq_bind_port_retries' controls number of retries before 'ports range exceeded' failure. For example:: rpc_zmq_min_port = 49153 rpc_zmq_max_port = 65536 rpc_zmq_bind_port_retries = 100 ======================= Existing Configurations ======================= Static Direct Connections ------------------------- The example of service config file:: [DEFAULT] transport_url = ""zmq+redis://host-1:6379"" [oslo_messaging_zmq] use_pub_sub = false use_router_proxy = false use_dynamic_connections = false zmq_target_expire = 60 zmq_target_update = 30 rpc_zmq_min_port = 49153 rpc_zmq_max_port = 65536 In both static and dynamic direct connections configuration it is necessary to configure firewall to open binding port range on each node:: iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --match multiport --dports 49152:65535 -j ACCEPT The sequrity recommendation here (it is general for any RPC backend) is to setup private network for message bus and another open network for public APIs. ZeroMQ driver doesn't support authentication and encryption on its level. As stated above this configuration is the simplest one since it requires only a Matchmaker service to be running. That is why driver's options configured by default in a way to use this type of topology. The biggest advantage of static direct connections (other than simplicity) is it's huge performance. On small deployments (20 - 50 nodes) it can outperform brokered solutions (or solutions with proxies) 3x - 5x times. It becomes possible because this configuration doesn't have a central node bottleneck so it's throughput is limited by only a TCP and network bandwidth. Unfortunately this approach can not be applied as is on a big scale (over 500 nodes). The main problem is the number of connections between services and particularly the number of connections on each controller node grows (in a worst case) as a square function of number of the whole running services. That's not appropriate. However this approach can be successfully used and is recommended to be used when services on controllers doesn't talk to agent services on resource nodes using oslo.messaging RPC, but RPC is used only to communicate controller services between each other. Examples here may be Cinder+Ceph backend and Ironic how it utilises oslo.messaging. For all the other cases like Nova and Neutron on a big scale using proxy-based configurations or dynamic connections configuration is more appropriate. The exception here may be the case when using OpenStack services inside Docker containers with Kubernetes. Since Kubernetes already solves similar problems by using KubeProxy and virtual IP addresses for each container. So it manages all the traffic using iptables which is more than appropriate to solve the problem described above. Summing up it is recommended to use this type of zmq configuration for 1. Small clouds (up to 100 nodes) 2. Cinder+Ceph deployment 3. Ironic deployment 4. OpenStack + Kubernetes (OpenStack in containers) deployment Dynamic Direct Connections -------------------------- The example of service config file:: [DEFAULT] transport_url = ""zmq+redis://host-1:6379"" [oslo_messaging_zmq] use_pub_sub = false use_router_proxy = false use_dynamic_connections = true zmq_failover_connections = 2 zmq_linger = 60 zmq_target_expire = 60 zmq_target_update = 30 rpc_zmq_min_port = 49153 rpc_zmq_max_port = 65536 The 'use_dynamic_connections = true' obviously states that connections are dynamic. 'zmq_linger' become crucial with dynamic connections in order to avoid socket leaks. If socket being connected to a wrong (dead) host which somehow still present in the Matchmaker and message was sent, then the socket can not be closed until message stays in the queue (the default linger is infinite waiting). So need to specify linger explicitly. Services often run more than one worker on the same topic. Workers are equal, so any can handle the message. In order to connect to more than one available worker need to setup 'zmq_failover_connections' option to some value (2 by default which means 2 additional connections). Take care because it may also result in slow-down. All recommendations regarding port ranges described in previous section are also valid here. Most things are similar to what we had with static connections the only difference is that each message causes connection setup and disconnect afterwards immediately after message was sent. The advantage of this deployment is that average number of connections on controller node at any moment is not high even for quite large deployments. The disadvantage is overhead caused by need to connect/disconnect per message. So this configuration can with no doubt be considered as the slowest one. The good news is the RPC of OpenStack doesn't require ""thousands message per second"" bandwidth per each particular service (do not confuse with central broker/proxy bandwidth which is needed as high as possible for a big scale and can be a serious bottleneck). One more bad thing about this particular configuration is fanout. Here it is completely linear complexity operation and it suffers the most from connect/disconnect overhead per message. So for fanout it is fair to say that services can have significant slow-down with dynamic connections. The recommended way to solve this problem is to use combined solution with proxied PUB/SUB infrastructure for fanout and dynamic direct connections for direct message types (plain CAST and CALL messages). This combined approach will be described later in the text. Router Proxy ------------ RPC may consume too many TCP sockets on controller node in directly connected configuration. To solve the issue ROUTER proxy may be used. --debugZeroMQ PUB/SUB Infrastructure ----------------------------- What If Mix Different Configurations? ------------------------------------- ================================","Other than AMQP-based drivers, like RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ doesn't have============= Configuration =============in the section [DEFAULT] of the conf file, the 'rpc_zmq_host' flag Match Making (mandatory) ------------------------The MatchMaker is pluggable and it provides two different MatchMaker classes.which is 120 (seconds) by default.

If a deployer has a mirror of uca/rdo, it probably wants to use it.
Defining the URL currently works, but that process wouldn't work if
the mirror is using a different key.

This commit keeps the current behavior of using UCA with signing
packages from upstream everywhere, but with this change, you can also
define your own mirror (CentOS/Ubuntu) with your own key.

1. ubuntu: enable placement API in Nova

Until now, we were only deploying Placement API on Ubuntu because

This was once needed because we were deploying actual neutron services
with devstack during environment setup [1]; but we don't do it anymore.

There is no conceptual difference between how we model and execute unit
and functional tests (both use testtools/unittest, both run from venv,
both don't rely on devstack deploying services) so it's better to keep
venv deployment logic identical too.

Currently, any tests which use security groups are excluded from
the gate-tempest-dsvm-cells job since cells does not support
security groups.  The exclusion is done using a blacklist
in:
http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/devstack/tempest-dsvm-cells-rc

This is part of a series of change to exclude the tests based on a new
tempest config option:
compute-feature-enabled.security_groups.

Also, some of the tempest scenario tests attempt to create a server with a
security group.  These will not work with cells, so use the new config option
to skip those tests.

Finally, the test_server_basic_ops scenario test was changed to allow
ssh validation when nova-network (fixed ip) is used.  This will allow the
gate-tempest-dvsm-cells job to run the test with ssh validation.
(For cells v1, neutron is not supported)

Other change sets are dependent on this change:
1) Devstack change to set the new option as False into tempest.conf
if cells are enabled.
I4f74b80024a9bcc374d374d86052dceb40598d32
2) Nova change to remove the security group related tests
from the blacklist.

At the moment, magnum handles only creation, deletion and scale up or down. Docker and kubernetes release new versions in a very high pace and magnum's cluster drivers try to keep up. A magnum cluster contains various components that can be upgraded. The container engine, currently docker only, network drivers like flannel, storage drivers like Rex-Ray or other components. In the current state, most of the components are embedded in the OS image, so upgrades can be handled by using a new image with a newer versions of one or more components. Proposed change =============== Implement a new API endpoint to receive upgrade requests and implement a specific logic for each driver. The upgrades are going to be tracked by the cluster templates. A cluster that can be upgraded must have been created by a cluster template with a specific version. Workflow to upgrade a cluster: 1. Create a cluster template with a specific set of attributes. This cluster template will have version 1. 2. Create a cluster using the above cluster template. 3. Modify the cluster template resulting to a new cluster template with version 2. 4. Request a cluster to upgrade from version 1 to 2. Assumptions made: * A cluster can be upgraded only from a cluster with version N to N + 1. * Not all attributes can be upgraded. Examples of upgradable fields: image, flavor, cluster driver (swarm_atomic_v1 to swarm_atomic_v2) * Operators will be responsible to guarantee that an upgrade is possible for public cluster templates. * Operators may allow end users to perform upgrades on clusters built by private cluster templates on their own risk. Modes of Operation ------------------ Each driver will implement at least one mode of operation. * Rolling upgrades: Upgrade all cluster nodes one by one without downtime. Meaning drain a compute instance and apply the upgrade. Masters must be upgraded first. TODO: Investigate upgrades of clusters with only one master * In-place upgrades: Upgrade all cluster nodes one by one or in parallel.

Previously the 'flake8' command was running but didn't seem to check

- And this patch fixes some 'flake8' issues.

It's possible to catch socket timeout error that can not
be handled by devops's wait() method because it stucks at
method execution instead of analyzing ret code.
Usage of more strict RunLimit with signal mechanism inside
allow us to reconnect much faster in case of closed socket.
Also decreasing timeout for connection check - all logs shows that
response time for good connection is less than 1 second.

If user has enabled “monkey_patch” config option and kept the default
“monkey_patch_modules” config option as is, then service gives
ValueError at the time of starting itself. The default value given to
the “monkey_patch_modules” config option is not according to the format

This patch fixes this issue by making monkey_patch_modules's correct
default value and if user wants to apply monkey patching then syntax
must be correct so handled that value error.

The red underline should only appear for error/warning status.

At the moment, the instances will be automatically saved whenever
the host is shut off. This adds a disk overhead which may not be
desired.

For this reason, this patch makes it configurable. By turning on
'instance_automatic_shutdown', instances will be turned off instead
of being saved when the host is turned off.

Note that existing VMs will not be affected by this config option.
For this reason, whenever an admin will change it, he has to make
sure that the existing VMs are updated.

Instance disk overhead will be calculated based on the assumption
that all the instances are configured the same way.

define new methods for each new model). Once we're done porting all
models from the old code to new, DbStore2 will supercede DbStore and can

Zeroing first 1Mb of a block device will almost always
lead to serios system error, if there is a filesystem
on this block device and this filesystem is mounted.

This code had 2 points: to prevent system from booting
from hard drive after reboot and to prevent anaconda
(or other OS installer) to automatically recognize
disk structure. But since we only use image-based provision
this is not the case anymore.

It's enough to clear first 446 bytes of MBR where the first
stage of a bootloader resides. So we will also be able to
check nodes disks and filesystems after deleting it from
cluster for troubleshooting for example, because partition
scheme will not be touched.

Apparently, release metadata contained referring to wrong cobbler
profile. That cobbler profile was used a while ago for native
installer purposes and became invalid since only IBP method of
provisioning remained.

The problem is that every node will be added to cobbler with
wrong profile and enabled netbooting. If provisioning failed for
some reasons, then the node won't boot because of stale broken links
to initrd and kernel.

`generator_arg` should reffer to valid name of cobbler profile for
 bootstrap image.

For 8.0 and newer, it should be 'ubuntu_bootstrap'
For 7.0 it should be 'bootstrap' (which stands for centos bootstrap)
