This commit adds a schema management tool for the Monasca
configuration database. Apart from the usual OpenStack schema
management tool subcommands (stamp, upgrade, version) it has
two extra subcommands:

* fingerprint: for computing a SHA1 fingerprint of the
               currently currently active database schema.
* detect-revision: for identifiying the Alembic revision
                   (if any) corresponding to a database
                   schema that was created with one of the
                   legacy SQL scripts.

The data provided by the detect-revision subcommand can be
used for stamping the database with Alembic version metadata
when transitioning an existing Monasca configuration database
to Alembic based database migrations.

want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

This patch implements a non-voting rolling upgrade test
using openstack-ansible tooling. The job and pipeline
is defined in-repo to ensure that the glance team has
complete control over the voting status, pipelines it is
in, etc.

The test uses the 'upgrade' tox environment in the
openstack/openstack-ansible-os_glance repository which
executes a build of two glance containers using the
the head of the stable branch of glance, then upgrades
to the proposed review. The upgrade is a complete rolling
upgrade using MariaDB as a database and using the file

This patch implements the multi-vif of VIF-Handler And Vif
Drivers Design.

This patch creates a new driver type MultiVIFDriver. It will
be the base class of real drivers like sriov,
additional_subnet and npwg_multiple_interfaces. Each of the
derived driver should implement the parsing of the additional
interfaces definition in K8S pods, and call VIF driver to
either create or acquire the Neutron port and its VIF object.

A list of enabled drivers can be returned by its class method.
So that the VIFHandler can invoke each driver one by one to
get the whole list of interfaces for one pod.

Partially Implements: blueprint multi-vif-pods

resource is added to the stack). This in turn results in the

Neutron-lib 1.18.0 is our Rocky RC and is already being used by neutron
[1]. This patch updates the neutron-lib required version to match
neutron [1] in prep for the Rocky release.

lower bounds of individual python modules are declared to
(test-)requirements.txt as requirements-check requires.

To work with neutron-lib 1.18.0, we need Rocky version of neutron,
so the minimum version of neutron is bumped to 13.0.0.0b2 (Rocky-2).

We also need to bump the minimum version of SQLAlchemy. Rocky neutron
depends on pending_to_persistent ORM event in SQLAlchemy which was added
in SQLAlchemy 1.1. Rocky neutron now requires SqlAlchemy>=1.2.0,
so the min version of SQLAlchemy is bumped to 1.2.0.

To fix tempest tests, we also disable port security. As current tests
already run with a wildcard security group to allow all traffic,
switching to port security disabled does not change much

There is no record for why we implement the MQ vhost/user creation
outside of the role in the playbook, when we could do it inside the
role.

Implementing it inside the role allows us to reduce the quantity of
group_vars duplicated from the role, and allows us to better document
the required variables in the role. The delegation can still be done
as it is done in the playbook too.

In this patch we remove the test vars and tasks which were duplicated
as they are no longer required.

When the RPC and Notify service are the same, the credentials
must match - otherwise the tasks to create the user/password
will overwrite with each other.

If the two clusters are different, then the matching credentials
and vhost will not be a problem. However, if the deployer really
wishes to make sure they're different, then the vars can be
overridden.

Also, to ensure that the SSL value is consistently set in the
conf file, we apply the bool filter. We also use the 'notify'
SSL setting as the messaging system for Notifications is more
likely to remain rabbitmq in our default deployment with qrouterd
becoming the default for RPC messaging.

It will fail when non-admin tenants try to get share networks
and security services with option '{all_tenants: 1}'.
The reason is that the policy of 'get_all_share_networks' and
'get_all_security_services' are admin api, they do not allow
the non-admin tenants list the share networks and security
services with all_tenants=1. This patch removes the policy check

This patch fixes the race condition with update/delete neutron

floatingip and port forwarding conflict with port.

Also this approach need the revision function, so need to fix in port
forwarding model to aware relationship revision update.

As the port forwarding resource associated with 2 resources,
one is floatingip, the other is neutron internal port.
So floatingip update/delete maybe in a conflict situation with
port forwarding creation. But for port, we just lack the logic to
process port forwarding during update port's fixed_ip and delete
port.

So the approach here is adding logic to let l3 plugin and port
forwarding plugin know each other when both sides may process the same
floatingip resource. Based on the existing revision_number feature,
if one side fail as db staleError, the api layer will retry the whole
operation for this resource, so there must be a failure on one side in
this case. This patch just adds the association logic for l3 plugin and
port forwarding plugin, also adds a event receiver for port update/delete.

Then the behavior about the port forwarding associated resources would
be:
* For fip resource, I introduce one function in that patch.
  _check_floatingip_request
So during floatingip update/delete, the function will process
fip and check by rpc callback from l3_plugin, if port forwarding plugin
also creates a port forwarding with the same fip at this moment. The
success side would be the one who update the fip_db first, the other side
would be failure after db retry.

* For port resource, during update port fixed_ip or delete port, we will
delete the associated port forwarding resources for free the
fip:external_port socket.

When disk size is none and base_device_size is larger than default_disk,
the disk size is assigned to base_device_size.
Because base_device_size is float type, when converting to interger ,
the disk size is smaller than base_device_size.
We need to assign the ceil of  base_device_size to the disk size.

For example there are 3 instances in a server group (quota is 5).
When doing multi-creating of 3 more instances in this group
(would have 6 members), current quota checking scheme will fail to
prevent this happening, which is not expected.

This is due to the server_group_members quota check previously
only counting group members that existed as instance records in
cell databases and not accounting for build requests which are
the temporary representation of the instance in the API database
before the instance is scheduled to a cell.

The recently updated minimum required libvirt version (1.3.1; in commit
403320b -- libvirt: Bump MIN_{LIBVIRT,QEMU}_VERSION for ""Rocky"") brings
in the newer libvirt migration API, migrateToURI3().  The newer API was
explicitly designed[*] to be backward compatible with the older variant.

So remove the usage of the older variants:

    migrateToURI()
    migrateToURI2()

And just stick to the newer API -- migrateToURI3().

Clean up the following:

 - Add the 'migrate_disks' and 'destination_xml' paramters, and remove
   the no longer needed 'domain_xml' from the Nova migrate() method.

 - Remove or fix various unit tests to use migrateToURI3().

 - Stub nova.virt.libvirt.guest.Guest.migrate() correctly in
   nova/tests/unit/virt/test_virt_drivers.py.

In case where Neutron logical port is placed directly to hypervisor,
hypervisor does a conntrack lookup before packets reach OVS integration
bridge. This patch introduces a rule with high priority that is placed
at the beginning of the egress pipeline. This rule removes conntrack
information from all packets if conntrack information is present. Then
packets continue in the egress pipeline.

That means all packets in egress pipeline are not tracked and ovs
firewall can do a lookup in correct zone. As for ingress pipeline, it
distinguishes between tracked - which are packets coming from egress
pipeline, and not tracked, which are inbound packets coming not from a
local port.

Over the past year the Zun project has achieved a lot of the important features includes: * Diskspace Management: Docker images and containers use the same space, it's better to choose a compute node to load images by DiskFilter and limit the diskspace of a container. * Quota support: This function achieves quota management for openstack Zun resource. * Zun available zone: Availability zone is within the scope of region. For example, the machines in a room are divided into a AZ in order to improve the isolation of disaster. For avoiding all the containers hang up together, we can choose the different AZs to create containers. * zun rebuild: Provide reconstruction function, if the container A is damaged, users can use this function to recreate a container B. The container B and A use the same resources, such as network, CPU, etc. Users can also replace image to achieve the purpose of upgrading container. My goals for the Stein cycle are to continue the progress made during the Rocky cycle in the following areas: * Support volume multi-attach: Make zun supports mount the same volume to different containers * Zun-monitor: Monitor the status of containers, the zun-compute services, the memory/cpu/diskspace of the zun-compute, then report the error/warning/notice to end-users. * Heal and evacuate: A periodic task monitors the status of container. If a error happends, the container should be healed or evacuated. * Placement API: Nova team is working to split its scheduler out and Zun would like to leverage this new service if appropriate. * Kubernetes: Kubernetes is probably the most popluar containers orchestration tool, but there are still some gaps that prevent Kubernetes to work well with OpenStack. I think Zun might be able to help to reduce the gaps. We could explore integration options for Kubernetes to make OpenStack more appealing for cloud-native users. Thank you for taking the time to consider me for Stein PTL. Best regards, Wei Ji ",,43,0

This job is to trigger readthedocs via their new API

The old API was quite simple in that anyone could hit the end-point
and trigger a new build.  The v2 API now requires authentication and a
unique id for each project we wish to update.

If projects wish, they can directly use the new ""trigger-readthedocs""
role (from the dependent change) and create their own jobs, providing
their username/password or webhook authentication token directly from
a secret in their project playbook.

This job, however, uses the infra secret for the ""openstackci"" user to
update the docs.  Projects that wish to take this route require some
minor setup, but don't have to worry about managing new jobs or their
secrets and gain some benefits in having the openstackci user as a
backup admin.

To use the trigger-readthedocs-webhook job, projects will need to do
the following:

1) add openstackci user as an admin of their RTD project

2) generate an webhook via the ""Integrations"" dashboard page on the
   RTD project

3) provide the id from that webhook URL in job or project variables.
   This webhook id is not private; it is useless without
   authentication (it appears to be a global monotonically increasing
   integer for each webhook generated).

4) include the job. gerrit-dash-creator is populated with the new job
   for initial testing.  Other projects are currently using the
   ""docs-on-readthedocs"" template.  Change
   I3b65813671961d07c0a743685c537ad1df4bf68 proposes switching the
   template to use this new job.

For Stein, we should continue working on some of the outstanding work items identified at previous PTGs and Summits.

In Rocky cycle, we finished many features, testing and bug fixing works. For example: * Kubernetes: Added dependency relationship between the master cluster and the worker cluster created for Kubernetes. * Docker driver: Supported update name operation for docker profile. * Nova server: Added operation support to migrate a nova server node. * Health check improve: Added a new detection type that actively pools the node health using a URL specified in the health policy. * Dashboard:adds ""Resize"" action for cluster panel. * Testing: API/Function/Integration test were moved to senlin-tempest-plugin. At the same time, we added chenyb4 and Duc Truong to the Senlin team, both of them given a great work for the team. As a PTL in Stein cycle, I'd like to continue to focus on the tasks as follows: * Grow the Senlin team of contributors and core reviewers. * Continue to improve k8s on Senlin feature implementation. * Collaborate with other OpenStack projects with joint blueprints. * Actively monitor incoming bug reports and assigned to fix them. * Acknowledgment of OpenStack-wide Goals. Thanks for taking the time to read through this roadmap and to consider my candidacy. Best Regards, XueFeng ",,32,0

Manila has a similar service architecture to Cinder and the
latter has received several fixes for update, upgrade, and FFU
tasks that are missing in Manila.

Align these tasks in the Manila services with Cinder versions
of the same.

In a multiarch environment if we have an image that doesn't have an
hw_architecture it can be scheduled on any node registered with ironic.
So this means that nova could schedule an x86_64 image on a ppc64le node
(clearly a bad thing).

Avoid that by always setting a hw_architecture image property matching
the kernel of the running system.  This is safe as in a single arch
environment, by definition all nodes are the same ;P and in a multiarch

I've been active in the OpenStack community since late 2014 early 2015 and have had a lot of focus on the Puppet OpenStack project since about 2016. I've been a core reviewer for about five months now and it's been really cool to be able to give something back to the community. We have had a lot of progress this cycle. * Remove a lot of deprecate parameters * Improved testing of Puppet 5 * Added Debian 9 support (Python 3 only) * Added Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic support * Fixed some bugs * Moved to more usage of the shared openstacklib resources * Added neutron-dynamic-routing support * Added horizon dashboard installation support * Changed keystone to use port 5000 and deprecated usage of port 35357 (still deploys both) I could ramble up a lot more in that list but I really think we've done a good job but we still have some major things moving forward that we'll have to work on. Here is some major things I think we'll need to work on or discuss. * Python 3 will be a big one, I know people are working on Fedora for testing here, but we also have Debian9 here which is python3-only so thanks to Thomas (zigo) we have somebody that has paved the way here. * Puppet 5 data types for parameters and removing validate_* functions is a big one which we also have an open blueprint and PoC for but will require a lot of interaction with the TripleO team. [0] [1] * CI stability and maintenance will be a reoccurring thing we'll need to focus on. * Puppet providers are usually slow due to CLI utilies, we need to work together to improve the performance of the CLI tooling or consider the move to API calls, this has been up before but there hasn't been anybody there that has sponsored such work. I want to really thank all of you for your huge amounts of work, all across the OpenStack board and the Puppet OpenStack team. Thank you for considering me.

I was strongly involved in the revival of the Blazar project, which started at the Barcelona Summit in 2016, and have been active in the community since. Our small team of contributors has done a lot of amazing work improving Blazar since then, including becoming an official project in the Queens release. I think our goals for the Stein cycle should be to continue our effort of leveraging the Placement API, start supporting reservations of non-compute resources, and evaluate what role Blazar can play in providing preemptible instances. Having operated Blazar in production for three years, I would also like to focus some of our effort on improving stability and usability. I am hoping I can lead the project team successfully and keep making Blazar more visible in the OpenStack community. Sincerely, Pierre Riteau ",,20,0

This patch removes the ResourceTracker.nodename attribute, switches the
compute manager to only create a single ResourceTracker object instance
which itself now has an in-memory dict of ComputeNode objects that are
managed by the nova-compute daemon.

This isolates the code that manages ComputeNode objects and resources in
just the resource tracker, which will make it possible for the scheduler
report client to manage Ironic nodes and custom resource classes
properly. The scheduler report client contains a cache of
ResourceProvider, Inventory, and Allocation records. We definitely did
not want to have multiple ResourceTracker object instances, each with
their own cache of ResourceProvider objects. Having a single
ResourceTracker and single scheduler report client is both more
efficient and a cleaner interface into the compute manager.

The validation checks that the hostname (fully qualified or not) is
present in the /etc/hosts file and adds it to /etc/hosts otherwise.

Previously the _check_hostname() function would raise an exception if
it had to write the hostname to /etc/hosts and it was not fully
qualified.

This patch make it accept non fully qualified hostnames to match the
actual check.

Add upgrade tasks for manila-share when it's controlled by pacemaker:

o Stop the service before the entire pacemaker cluster is stopped.
  This ensures the service is stopped before infrastructure services
  (e.g. rabbitmq) go away.
o Migrate the manila DB prior to restarting the service. This covers
  the situation when puppet-manila (who otherwise would handle the db
  sync) isn't managing the service.

If the call to compute_rpcapi.quisece_instance() raises an exception,
any uncaught exception will break out of the function
snapshot_volume_backed(). This can leave the instance in frozen state.

This patch adds a blanket Exception catch to the try block and calls
compute_rpcapi.unquiesce_instance() before reraising.

This has been seen in the wild with RPC timeouts, but this is not the
only possible genesis for an unknown error from quiesce_instance.

If the compute service we're deleting has never been
discovered (mapped to a cell using discover_hosts) or the
host mapping was already deleted, we need to handle the
HostMappingNotFound error when deleting a compute service
so that we (1) don't 500 out of the API and (2) continue to
delete the compute service.

The CachingScheduler doesn't create allocations in
placement so when prep_resize fails and it tries
to revert allocations, the _revert_allocation() method
returns False and then prep_resize calls
delete_allocation_for_failed_resize() which since change
I7891b98f225f97ad47f189afb9110ef31c810717 has taken a
context argument, but that's not being passed so it
results in a TypeError.

This fixes the TypeError and adds a functional test case
which runs a resize reschedule scenario with the
CachingScheduler.

The /etc/mtab file may have mount information such as 'nfsd'
that if copied to /etc/fstab will cause the share server to
hang when rebooted.

Update /etc/fstab with exactly the newly mounted or unmounted
shares rather than simply overwriting /etc/fstab with /etc/mtab.

Remove tempest conf dependencies from run time test resource
details. Introduce resource.yml to define test resources as
a dedicated configuration file. Allow for tests to run against
matrixes of test resources.

This has several drawbacks: - it is not possible for a deployer to configure tempest until test resources are created, which requires a running cloud - using different resources in different tests requires a proliferation of configuration options: for instance we have a guest image for API tests, a guest image for scenario tests and a guest image for third-party tests. Each of them comes with it's own name or ID and ssh user and possibly other metadata - we have very little flexibility on how we use test resources for tests. If a test requires a special guest image or a different flavor, it must either define a new configuration option or impose its own image / flavour to all other tests - the configuration file is huge and difficult to handle Proposed change =============== We shall move all test resources to a dedicated YAML file, structured as follows: - resources: - images: - name: small-footprint size: 100MB boot: quick ssh: user: cirros keypair: yes password: yes tools: ip: /bin/ip - name: fedora size: 1GB boot: slow cfn-agent: true - flavors: - name: tiny Alternatives ------------ TBD Projects ======== TBD Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact.

dnsmasq wont give out an static IP address to a device if it
has already given out that IP to the same MAC address with a
different dhcp6 ClientID or IAID[1]

when provisioning over IPv6 this is a problem because these ID's change
between the dhcp client in PXE, iPXE and in the deployed OS.

In order to work around this we need to use statless addressing, but we
still need dnsmasq as PXE doesn't appear to support statless addressing
and dhcp is still needed in order to provide the bootfile-url for both
tftp and http

So on the provisioning network the boot process looks like this
PXE -
   IP and bootfile-url from dnsmasq over dhcp6
iPXE -
   IP using the statless IP being advertised by radvd
   bootfile-url from dnsmasq over dhcp6
deployed OS
   IP using the statless IP being advertised by radvd

In containerized deployment gating, a simple change can lead to a
cascade of packages and containers to be rebuilt. Letting all the
containers to update packages from remote repositories may take too long
to meet gate timeout requirements.
This is one of the approach possible, create a local repo synced from
the remote, from which all the containers can take their packages
The role
- identifies enabled delorean repos
- syncs them locally
- create repos out of the local dir
- installs and execute a lighttpd to serve the repos
- create repo files to use those repos, using default ipv4 address

On current ovb test environment, the complete repos sync may take up to
7 minutes.

a regression which crept in during the switch to containers I think,

With this change devmode will deploy containerized services in the
overcloud by default when devmode for releases Pike and later.

Since the option to update containers has been added, gate jobs will
also run with a containerized overcloud by default for relevant
releases. Updating containers is enabled by default in devmode and
the ci-scripts when deploying with a containerized overcloud.

Two options are added:
--non-containerized-overcloud to change the default for non-gate mode
--containerized-overcloud to force containerized overcloud even in gate mode

The network environment validation currently only checks the
network settings in the environments/network-environment-yaml file.
However, some operators use the environments/ips-from-pool*.yaml files
to define static IPs. These files are not validated, so errors like IP
collisions and duplications might go unnoticed if these files are used
in a deployment.

This patch extends the network environment validation to check these
files as well. But because we don't know if those files are being
used for a deployment at the of the validation, any errors found in
these files are shown as warnings, while the validation will only fail
if there are errors in the main network-environment.yaml file.

This patch updates the docker services so that we maintain
the service_name (a required interface) within the docker/services
themselves rather than ""extend"" this value from the puppet service.

The primary benefit is that we can add unit tests on this interface.
It also simplifies the templates a bit.

stack effectively undeletable. (Since the updated_at time is not modified
on delete in the legacy path, we never checked it when deleting a nested
stack.)

To prevent this, change the order of operations so that the stack is first
put into the DELETE_IN_PROGRESS state before the delete_stack call returns.
Only after the state is stored, spawn a thread to complete the operation.

Since there is no stack lock in convergence, this gives us the flexibility
to cancel other in-progress workers after we've already written to the
Stack itself to start a new traversal.

The previous patch in the series means that snapshots are now also deleted
after the stack is marked as DELETE_IN_PROGRESS. This is consistent with
the legacy path.

There is no record for why we implement the MQ vhost/user creation
outside of the role in the playbook, when we could do it inside the
role.

Implementing it inside the role allows us to reduce the quantity of
group_vars duplicated from the role, and allows us to better document
the required variables in the role. The delegation can still be done
as it is done in the playbook too.

In this patch we implement two new variables:
- cloudkitty_oslomsg_rpc_setup_host
- cloudkitty_oslomsg_notify_setup_host

These are used in the role to allow delegation of the MQ vhost/user
setup for each type to any host, but they default to using the first
member of the applicable oslomsg host group.

We also adjust some of the defaults to automatically inherit existing
vars set in group_vars form the integrated build so that we do not
need to do the wiring in the integrated build's group vars. We still
default them in the role too for independent role usage.

Finally, we remove the test mq setup tasks and clean up any unused

If the two clusters are different, then the matching credentials

Implementing listing or showing resource in every client leads to
a lot of duplicated code. This change adds a base client class
which implements common helpers.

Removes ""Database"" prefix from class names and ""db"" infix
from method signatures for alignment with standards from the rest
of the community.

Also, adds doseq option by URL encoding to handle sequence field
values.

There is no record for why we implement the MQ vhost/user creation
outside of the role in the playbook, when we could do it inside the
role.

Implementing it inside the role allows us to reduce the quantity of
group_vars duplicated from the role, and allows us to better document
the required variables in the role. The delegation can still be done
as it is done in the playbook too.

In this patch we implement two new variables:
- zun_oslomsg_rpc_setup_host
- zun_oslomsg_notify_setup_host

These are used in the role to allow delegation of the MQ vhost/user
setup for each type to any host, but they default to using the first
member of the applicable oslomsg host group.

We also adjust some of the defaults to automatically inherit existing
vars set in group_vars form the integrated build so that we do not
need to do the wiring in the integrated build's group vars. We still
default them in the role too for independent role usage.

Finally, we remove the test mq setup tasks and clean up any unused
or unnecessary variables configured in tests.

There is no record for why we implement the MQ vhost/user creation
outside of the role in the playbook, when we could do it inside the
role.

Implementing it inside the role allows us to reduce the quantity of
group_vars duplicated from the role, and allows us to better document
the required variables in the role. The delegation can still be done
as it is done in the playbook too.

In this patch we implement two new variables:
- tacker_oslomsg_rpc_setup_host
- tacker_oslomsg_notify_setup_host

These are used in the role to allow delegation of the MQ vhost/user
setup for each type to any host, but they default to using the first
member of the applicable oslomsg host group.

We also adjust some of the defaults to automatically inherit existing
vars set in group_vars form the integrated build so that we do not
need to do the wiring in the integrated build's group vars. We still
default them in the role too for independent role usage.

Finally, we remove the test mq setup tasks and clean up any unused
or unnecessary variables configured in tests.

There is no record for why we implement the MQ vhost/user creation
outside of the role in the playbook, when we could do it inside the
role.

Implementing it inside the role allows us to reduce the quantity of
group_vars duplicated from the role, and allows us to better document
the required variables in the role. The delegation can still be done
as it is done in the playbook too.

In this patch we implement two new variables:
- congress_oslomsg_rpc_setup_host
- congress_oslomsg_notify_setup_host

These are used in the role to allow delegation of the MQ vhost/user
setup for each type to any host, but they default to using the first
member of the applicable oslomsg host group.

We also adjust some of the defaults to automatically inherit existing

need to do the wiring in the integrated build's group vars. We still
default them in the role too for independent role usage.

Finally, we remove the test mq setup tasks and clean up any unused

Rally does not adhere to the global requirements process, so its
requirements extend beyond those managed by upper-constraints, and
sometimes are incompatible with upper constraints.

We have no need to track their development from git commit to git
commit, and can rather rely on stable releases which we verify are
working with the upper constraints whenever we do a pinning bump.

This keeps things simpler for us, and also allows the repo build
process in the integrated build to do a constrained venv build
instead of doing it unconstrained and breaking stable branch builds
down the line.

When OpenStack actions are called, they can sometimes raise exceptions.
Sometimes, those 'exceptions' are actually expected. For instance, if
one wants to probe whether a Swift container exists, one may want the
error, but don't want to log the exception, as it could lead to false
positives in the logs. The 'log_exceptions' parameter to the action
will suppress that log. It defaults to True, as this is the existing
behavior.

I have been working on OpenStack for several years now. I started out mostly involved with keystone but I have contributed to a wide range of projects over the years. More recently I pushed for formal recognition of the *-powervm projects and PowerVMStackers was born. I served as the PowerVMStackers PTL for the Rocky release cycle, its first as an official project, and I would be honored to continue in that role for another term. During the Rocky cycle we have made good progress porting PowerVM driver functionality from nova-powervm into nova proper. I intend to continue to make that a priority going forward. I would also like to see our documentation moved from readthedocs.io to docs.openstack.org and generally improved. We have made a few improvements in Rocky but there is a lot more that can be done there. I am looking forward to diving in with the team and determining what our development priorities will be for Stein. I expect one of these to be a continuation of the device passthrough work that is beginning in Rocky. And of course as always, we need to maintain nova-powervm, networking-powervm, and ceilometer-powervm as changes happen in their parent projects (nova, neutron, and ceilometer), bugs are opened, etc. I've very much enjoyed being part of this team. I'm encouraged to see some new folks showing interest in our work, and I hope to see that continue. I will do whatever is within my power to see that it does. If anyone is looking for help or has any questions, find me on irc as edmondsw. - Matthew Edmonds ",,35,0

Today, I'd like to continue serving Zaqar better as a PTL, if you let me. We did a great job in Rocky. Supported the different format of client id to be more suitable for more use cases. We also introduced the function to query queues filtered by name and metadata in mongodb backend. For Stein release, I want to finish the list of job below. 1. Refactoring We want to remove useless pool group totally in Stein and make the model of pool and flavor more clear. 2. Scalability We will continue our work to improve Zaqar's performance under the different cases of load increasing: 1) number of publishers 2) number of subscribers 3) rate of messages published or consumed 4) number of messages 5) number of queues 6) size of messages 3. Usability We still have some works that inherit from Rocky.

I am Dharmendra Kushwaha known as dkushwaha on IRC. I member of Tacker community since Mitaka release. During my journey, I was involved in multiple features development activities(like Network Service, alarm based monitoring, VNFFG-NS etc.), bug triages, fixes and code improvement activities, verifying and testing for team. It is a great experience for me to working in OpenStack/Tacker project with very supportive contributors team. Other than community, I was involved in couple of NFV related PoCs and to identify the production gaps in Tacker. As of now Sridhar and Gong sheng Yang have done a great job with a great team support, I have learnt many things from them and would like to serve the community on those footprints. During the journey, Tacker comes with multiple rich features and still growing in the same direction. Still we have to do lot more and my main goals of Stein are as follow: * Tacker CI/CD Improvement: - Currently in Tacker more scenarios and proper integration testing is lacking on gate, needs to introduce more coverage. - Focus to introduce more functional and scenario tests for max code coverage. - We have to setup a process where every code should go with proper integration test on gate. * Tacker stability & production ready: - Identify industries requirements and prioritize their requirements. - Focus to have more error-handling and significant logging. - Cross community contribution for feature integration. - Parallel/large node deployment stability. - More towards NFV-MANO rich features. * Growing the community with more active core contributors. * More physical gathering of Tacker team in OpenStack conferences. You can find my complete contributions here: http://stackalytics.com/?release=all&project_type=all&metric=commits&user_id=dharmendra-kushwaha Thanks for reading and consideration my candidacy.

As the main developer and project lead until now, I'm the best suited to continue leading the project at this time and finish the current work that is needed to bring it to a place where the wider community can embrace what Adjutant offers and better tweak it to their own needs. My focus for Stein will be continuing the refactor work that was started during Queens, and finishing the sub-project management APIs as well as project termination APIs. As such the planned work is: - bringing the codebase to a much nicer state while decoupling certain elements of our internals, and adding support for async task processing. - rework the config system or potentially adopt oslo.config if appropriate - introduce partial policy support rather than relying on hardcoded decorators. - rework notifications to be pluggable and how/when they are sent - finish the long planned support for sub-project management, and the project (and resource) termination logic I hope for it to be a productive cycle, with some of that work broken into smaller pieces that new contributors could potentially help with. :) Cheers, Adrian Turjak ",,19,0

This is still an exciting time for Barbican. We're seeing more deployers using Barbican, and that trend should continue as deployers focus more on meeting security and compliance requirements. A castellan compatible backend has finally been prescribed as a base service, meaning that we should start seeing more integrations as Openstack developers start to store their secrets more securely. In particular, for the Stein cycle, I'd like to continue the progress made in Rocky to: 1) Grow the Barbican team of contributors and core reviewers. 2) Help drive further collaboration with other Openstack projects. 3) Help ensure that deployments are successful by keeping up on bugs fixes and backports. 4) Help develop new secret store plugins, in particular : -- making sure the vault plugin works robustly. -- using the PKCS#11 plugin to communicate with ATOS, Luna, Thales and SoftHSM. -- SGX and Fortanix 5) Continue the stability, maturity and usability enhancements.

For Stein, I would like to continue to focus on: - Ironic Bare Metal instance HA support - Masakari integration with Mistral - Complete OpenStack Ansible support for Masakari - Complete Masakari Dashboard (Horizon plugin for Masakari) - Continue to work with OpenStack HA team to develop OpenStack resource agents as an alternative for masakari-monitors. While working on above development, I think it is equally important to focus on raising awareness and adoption of Masakari, improve diversity of the team, and improve cross project/community communication and support. I will make my best effort to find more users, more reviewers and more developers for Masakari. Finally, I would like to thank you all Masakari contributors for your hard work over past cycles, and all OpenStack community members for your valuable comments, opportunities, and all the help you gave.

I have been truly amazed by our accomplishments of the last six months and I wish to continue this momentum. As such I am announcing my candidacy and self nomination for the position of Ironic PTL. I promise to continue the application of irony. This past cycle has been very eye opening for me and has taught me a lot about the community at large and the challenges they face. My passion has not wavered and I wish to continue enhancing ironic's capabilities. Operators are central to our community, and we need to continue enhancements that help operators but at the same time we need to revisit our old ideas and plans. In a sense we have already started to do this and we need to continue it. Efforts such as splitting iPXE out of PXE make lots of sense and better enables mixed hardware and even architecture fleets to co-exist. My vision for this next cycle is to setup ironic to become the the defacto API driven hardware provisioning toolkit. This will naturally mean some more work and we will need to continue with our momentum and focus on ennoblement and performance enhancements to improve the user experience. Thank you for your consideration. Julia Kreger (TheJulia) ",,27,0

I have been personally involved in the deployment of OpenStack for many years now, using all sorts of different deployment tools. Ansible seems like a great choice for deployment OpenStack and I've been using OpenStack Ansible for quite a while now. As PTL, I hope that I can work with the team to focus on the following: # CI - Improve stability of CI for both roles and integrated repo. by using more mirrors. - Start leveraging the integrated repo playbooks inside the role test jobs in order to avoid the duplication and test the OpenStack Ansible path - Once jobs are stable, add integrated jobs to all roles in order to be sure that we don't break the integrated repo with role changes. # Deployment - Continue to work and finalize the addition of distro installation for all distributions. - Aim to start integrating the `systemd` roles and look into seeing the possibility of enabling nspawn and avoiding lxc on CentOS. There's much more to be done, but those are some of the aspects that would help in the stability of this project which is what I feel we need to focus a bit more on. As a deployment project with a limited scope of the operating systems needing to exist, there doesn't seem to be much we can come up with and taking a cycle just to catch up on all the debt, improve stability and make the maintenance of the project easier is extremely useful. I hope to work with the team for the upcoming cycle. Regards, Mohammed ",,37,0

I'd like to nominate myself for the TripleO PTL role for the Stein cycle. Alex has done a great job as a PTL: The project is progressing nicely with many new, exciting features and uses for TripleO coming to fruition recently. It's a great time for the project. But, there's more work to be done. I have served the TripleO community as a core-reviewer for some years now and, more recently, by driving the Security Squad. This project has been a great learning experience for me, both technically (I got to learn even more of OpenStack) and community-wise. Now I wish to better serve the community further by bringing my experiences into PTL role. While I have not yet served as PTL for a project before,I'm eager to learn the ropes and help improve the community that has been so influential on me. For Stein, I would like to focus on: * Increasing TripleO's usage in the testing of other projects Now that TripleO can deploy a standalone OpenStack installation, I hope it can be leveraged to add value to other projects' testing efforts. I hope this would subsequentially help increase TripleO's testing coverage, and reduce the footprint required for full-deployment testing. * Technical Debt & simplification We've been working on simplifying the deployment story and battle technical depth -- let’s keep this momentum going. We've been running (mostly) fully containerized environments for a couple of releases now; I hope we can reduce the number of stacks we create, which would in turn simplify the project structure (at least on the t-h-t side). We should also aim for the most convergence we can achieve (e.g. CLI and UI workflows). * CI and testing The project has made great progress regarding CI and testing; lets keep this moving forward and get developers easier ways to bring up testing environments for them to work on and to be able to reproduce CI jobs. Thanks! Juan Antonio Osorio Robles IRC: jaosorior ",,41,0

This would be my third release as PTL and am happy to continue leading this great project. As I look back at the last two releases we have gotten some good things done. The implementation of multi-attach has been a goal of Cinder for quite some time and I am glad to have been able to help make this happen. We have also seen a change from trying to get new features implemented in Cinder to fixing bugs and making Cinder more user friendly and stable. During the Rocky release we have continued to improve our documentation, have worked on improving HA support and removed a lot of old code that did not need to remain in tree. I think this is an important evolution in the Cinder project: to focus on stability, usability and maintainability of our code. With that said I think the Stein release is going to be a challening release for Cinder. We have the following issues that are going to need to be addressed: * Migration to Storyboard * Dwindling review support * Making decisions around the Placement Service and Cinder * Continuing discussion around Cinder as a Stand-alone service I am hoping that I will be able to use my experience over the last two releases to move the above issues forward.

We also took an active part in the self-healing SIG discussions, as we believe Vitrage should hold an important role in every self-healing scenario. Among the most important tasks we did in Rocky were: * Fast-failover of vitrage-graph * Alarm history * Significant performance improvements * Kubernetes and Prometheus datasources In Stein, I would like to continue the effort around Virage usability and stability. In addition, we should integrate Vitrage with more projects, to give the user maximum visibility of the state of the system.

These users range from academia, telco and enterprise, right through to home labs, and we as a core review team have made some great new friends along the way. That said there is still a huge amount we need to do within OpenStack-Helm, to build on these foundations and capitalize on the work we have done to date, as PTL my priorities would be as follows: *) Uphold the 4 Opens *) Improve documentation for both onboarding developers, and operations *) Build up a more diverse group of reviewers *) Finally cut the fabled 1.0 release *) Build more links between OSH and other related projects Regardless of the outcome, I'm excited to continue contributing to OpenStack-Helm.

Thank you all for bearing with me for the past cycle as I have learned the ropes of being a PTL. We accomplished a lot in Rocky, with some highlights including: * Experimented with a new review process, ""review runways"" * Began using the new Neutron port binding API to minimize network downtime * during live migrations * Completed the placement side of nested resource providers (Nova integration work still remains) * Volume-backed instances will no longer claim root_gb for new instances and existing instances will heal during move operations * Made progress on removing nova-network-specific REST APIs * Added a nova-manage command to purge archived shadow table data * Doing more pre-filtering in placement before we iterate over compute host candidates with FilterScheduler filters * Added the ability to boot instances with trusted virtual functions * Added the ability to disable a cell in cells v2 Added a way to mitigate Meltdown/Spectre performance degradation via cpu flags Looking toward Stein, we have more work to do with integrating placement nested resource providers into Nova, implementing migration of flat resource providers => nested tree-based resource providers in placement, adding more resiliency in cells v2 for handling ""down"" or poorer performing cells, removing nova-network, and more to be discussed and prioritized at the PTG [1].

I think I've learned the mechanics now and can focus more energy on priorities. Today manila itself is pretty solid. It doesn't need lots of new features. Back end vendors always want to expose new bells and whistles, and that's fine if they help with the review load and contribute to the community. Reciprocity makes the world go around. But I see the adoption curve for manila just now ramping up and my own focus will be to enable that by working harden manila, and make it easier to use, both within and outside of openstack itself. Manila offers self-service file-shares -- RWX, random access storage -- and abstracts over a variety of file-systems and sharing protocols. Manila doesn't care whether the consumers of the file systems live within openstack, it's just a matter of network reachability and the access rights that manila manages. Besides being able to run as one part of a full openstack deployment, manila can run on its own, with keystone to enable multi-tenancy, or completely standalone. So I see manila as a true Open Infrastructure project. It can turn a rack of unconfigured equipment into self-service shared file systems without limiting itself to the (very important) Virtual Private Server use case [1]. I will, accordingly, work to position manila as *the* open source solution for deploying RWX random access storage across data centers and across clouds. To that end we need to: * get manila into generalized cloud providers like CSI [2] * get manila into the openstack sdk and openstack client * get more of the almost thirty manila back ends exposed in production-quality deployment tools like tripleo, kolla-*, and juju. * continue to fix bugs, improve our CI, run more stuff in gate with python 3 These are the things that will drive me if you choose me as manila PTL.

There is no record for why we implement the MQ vhost/user creation
outside of the role in the playbook, when we could do it inside the
role.

Implementing it inside the role allows us to reduce the quantity of
group_vars duplicated from the role, and allows us to better document
the required variables in the role. The delegation can still be done
as it is done in the playbook too.

In this patch we implement two new variables:
- barbican_oslomsg_rpc_setup_host
- barbican_oslomsg_notify_setup_host

These are used in the role to allow delegation of the MQ vhost/user
setup for each type to any host, but they default to using the first
member of the applicable oslomsg host group.

We also adjust some of the defaults to automatically inherit existing
vars set in group_vars form the integrated build so that we do not
need to do the wiring in the integrated build's group vars. We still
default them in the role too for independent role usage.

Finally, we remove the test mq setup tasks and clean up any unused
or unnecessary variables configured in tests.

Fix the Redis service configuration by force-disabling the TLS

configuration (gnocchi_api and HAProxy). The hiera keys are
defined in service_config_settings to be compatible with composable HA.

As part of the migration to zuul v3 the legacy-tempest-dsvm-neutron-src
was created with the end goal of replacing the legacy job with a v3
based job. This patch adds a new in-repo zuul v3 job that runs the
tempest full suite with neutron/master that will replace the legacy

See https://review.openstack.org/#/c/587112/ for details on removing
the legacy job from neutron-lib in the project-config.

Our role tests execute as non-root users, and the roles
need to access the environment variables for that non-root
user. Ansible, when targeting localhost, changes to
'connection: local' and thus breaks everything we need
to do against localhost as root unless we use 'become: true',
but we if generally use that against remote hosts we lose
the environment variables for the non-root user.

As such, we switch the inventory to target 'swift-host1'
instead, which has the address '127.0.0.1', so that we do not
have to deal with the implict connection type changes implemented
by Ansible.

We also add the rabbitmq/oslomsg groups to the inventory as they
are now required by the keystone role.

cmp() builtin is not available in Python 3. This commit removes its

assertNotEqual() in Services tests, so that was always passing.

Also tests were interfering with each other as labels added for pods in

The allowed task states for a hard reboot include 'pausing'
but the instance.save(expected_task_states) doesn't include
'pausing', so if you try to hard reboot a pausing instance
it will fail with UnexpectedTaskStateError.

This makes the expected_task_states passed to Instance.save
use the same list of allowed task states that we use in the
check_instance_state decorator, and re-writes the unit test
to use an actual database to verify the Instance.save()
behavior and task state check in the DB API.

While we're at it, the API reference is updated to indicate
the allowed states for each type of reboot.

Since the addition of NVE support in the NetApp ONTAP driver,
the driver fails to start when a VE license is not present on
a 9.1 (or later) ONTAP box.

This patch fixes the problem by improving error handling.

The thinking here was that no time passes between reading the cluster
status and ID, and reading a new snapshot, and therefore that if we've
just successfully read cluster ID and status, the etcd server must be
available and so it should be exceedingly unlikely for the etcd server
to be unavailable for the snapshot read.

However, a customer has reported just such a problem, with these
timings:

13:56:00 A subnet was created or updated.
13:56:00 Start watching for further changes after that.
13:56:12 Start of loop again, successfully read cluster ID and current revision.
13:56:19 ConnectionFailedError while trying to read new snapshot.

So let's allow for etcd connectivity loss while reading the snapshot,
and handle the same as earlier in the loop, i.e. by waiting 5s and then
retrying.
