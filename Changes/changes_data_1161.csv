This reverts commit 0562e2ae27c1d6b2e027e63c5af4e1153f44224b, reversing
changes made to 5fd379f0cd8106808ab9fc098ca1094c7d91041a.

The issue is that by design, the start action will start beam process
and stop the rabbit app, unless master promoted or slave joined cluster.
We have to revert aforementioned commit as it introduced a regression
to the action monitor, which is to report ""Not running"", when rabbit app
is stopped.

The thing is we reboot nodes one by one
sleeping couple seconds between subsequent reboot RPC calls.
Sometimes we spend quite long time doing this, time
which is enough for one or more nodes to reboot.
We then call sync method (which is absolutely unnecessary)
and cobbler removes all tftp configs and creates them
again. And sometimes a node can not get the config that
makes it stick on boot asking a user to press any key.

As reported in bug #1430042 when using evacuate + neutron virtual
machines fail to evacuate because of a failure to update port
bindings.  A similar issue applies to FloatingIP setup for
nova-network.

A related fix was proposed in
https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nova/+question/257358
and seemed to be fixing users.

This handles things a bit differently in order to more cleanly
use existing code.

This patch adds FuelEnvironment resource manager for context cleanup.
This manager removes all Fuel environments for admin user,
since Fuel resources are only managed for admin user.

There are no managers for another Fuel resources (node, task) added,
because only environments can be explicitly deleted by fuelclient.

Allow puppet implementation to optionally select a different transport
for signalling heat - the default CFN_SIGNAL is maintained, but can
now be easily modified - long term we probably want to switch to
signalling via swift and disabling heat-api-cfn in the seed.

Currently if a failure happens on a controller as part of an HA
deployment, the failure is ignored and the deployment continues on the
rest of the nodes. This can lead to errors in the post deployment
phase. One particular instance is when Ceph is being utilized and
we attempt to restart the rados processes on all of the controllers.

In order to prevent errors that may occur in the post deployment
phase, we need to ensure that all actions were successful on all of
the regular controller nodes as well as the primary-controller role.

Some compute manager tests that exercise the exception behavior of
methods combined with using a somewhat real instance parameter when
doing so take very long time to complete(>60s). This happens if the
method being tested has the @revert_task_state decorator because it
will try to update the instance using a conductor call when there is
no conductor service listening.

By setting the use_local flag, these tests no longer experience such
timeouts and total test time is reduced by minutes.

Added an Ubuntu nodeset stolen from the puppetlabs apache module.
The box_url is necessary even though the box is namespaced, vagrant
seems to have changed recently and just having the vagrant cloud
namespace in the box name is not enough to import the box.

We're making this nodeset the default so that a developer can have
it ""just work"" on their laptop. CI will be configured to use a
nodepool nodeset. Following the example of the puppetlabs modules,
the default nodeset is a copy of the new ubuntu nodeset so that
setting BEAKER_set=ubuntu-server-1404-x64 still works.

Fixed an error in the README (correct environment variable is
BEAKER_set not BEAKER_setfile) and added more details.

Currently the libvirt secret key is demanded to the ceph cluster
via the $(ceph auth get-key ...) command which requires the ceph
cluste to be already up and also assumes the computes are provisioned
with the client.admin keyring.

With this change we add a libvirt_rbd_secret_key parameter which,
if passed, is used instead so that computes can be configured
without the distribution of additional keys.

Currently the libvirt secret key is demanded to the ceph cluster
via the $(ceph auth get-key ...) command which requires the ceph
cluste to be already up and also assumes the computes are provisioned
with the client.admin keyring.

With this change we add a libvirt_rbd_secret_key parameter which,
if passed, is used instead so that computes can be configured
without the distribution of additional keys.

Aims at fixing two issues: we had an unless clause which was only

for the authentication endpoint.  By default it is ""v2.0"".  Providers
that support the v3 api should override this method to return ""v3"".

b) self.get_api_version_for_cmd - this is the api version provided
to the openstack command as --os-identity-api-version.  By default
this function returns [] the empty array which tells openstack to
use the version 2 default.  Providers that support the v3 api should
override this method to return [""--os-identity-api-version"", ""3""].

Except for aggregation related tests, duplicate /v1/archive_policy
related tests from test_rest into gabbi tests to remove redundancy.

The initial plan was to just remove tests from test_rest that had
duplicates under gabbi, but it was easier to reconcile into one
source of authority.

on python3 but not python2. The issue is in pecan as described in

W/o this fix:
* get_monitor() does not handle the case then rabbit
app is running and reports $OCF_RUNNING. This makes
the resource to stuck in semi-started state for ever.
* get_monitor() does not always record in logs when
sets master score 0 to ensure the slave does not get
promoted. This makes logging patterns not consistent.
* get_monitor() has two exit point for generic error case
instead of one. This makes logging patterns not consistent.
* some variables are missing the local
declaration and might be reused in another places
leading to unpredictable results. For example,
there is the nodelist var should be local as it is
used both action_notify(), get_monitor().

The solution is:
* fix missing local declarations for variables and
remove unused ones as well.
* add missing log record for ""ensuring this slave does
not get promoted.""
* handle the get_monitor() case when rabbit app is not
running as appropriate and report $OCF_NOT_RUNNING.
* make the single get_monitor() return point for the
$OCF_ERR_GENERIC case.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================ Allow admins to query keypairs owned by any user ================================================ https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/admin-query-any-keypair This change simply allows admin users to query keypairs owned by users other than themselves. Problem description =================== Currently, keypairs are only available to their owners. Admins should be able to see the keypairs of other users, when needed. Use Cases ---------- As the admin of an openstack cluster I need to see what keypairs a user has. Project Priority ----------------- (yet to be defined) Proposed change =============== This change doesn't affect the API format or schema in any way, but merely adds a query key to select a specific user for the keypair query. The following is a request currently allowed: GET /os-keypairs/ After this change, admins would be able to do this: GET /os-keypairs/?user_id=foobar Alternatives ------------ We could add a new admin API method to facilitate this, but doing so would be a lot more work for little (if any) benefit. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- * Specification for the method * The existing index operation for keypairs will be extended to honor an optional ""user_id"" parameter. * Method type: GET * Normal http response code(s): 200 * Expected error http response code(s) * 403: If the user is not an admin * ``/v2.1/ {tenant_id} /os-keypairs?user_id= {user_id} `` * Parameters which can be passed via the url: The alternate user id * JSON schema definition for the body data is unchanged * JSON schema definition for the response data is unchanged * Example use case: Request: GET http://127.0.0.1:8774/v2.1/e0c1f4c0b9444fa086fa13881798144f/os-keypairs?user_id=foo * There should not be any impacts to policy.json files for this change Security impact --------------- Admin users will be able to see the public keys of other users. However, these are generally regarded as material suitable for public viewing anyway. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- * This change will imply changes to the python-novaclient to allow specifying the user for which keypairs should be listed. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: danms Other contributors: Dan Radez Work Items ---------- * Add a new microversion and make os-keypairs honor the user_id query parameter Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Unit tests are sufficient for this extremely simple change. Documentation Impact ==================== The nova/api/openstack/rest_api_version_history.rst document will be updated.

Added support for updated_migrated_volume to common driver.
Added rename_volume to dell_storagecenter_api to support it.
Added tests to test_dellsc.py and test_dellapi.py.

The only thing we do in this rename the newly migrated volume
destination volume on the Dell Storage center to be the same
as the original volume ID.  Since we identify the volumes
by volume ID this prevents them from being lost.

Added command that will perform setup and teardown of
required networking configuration.

Network configuration will perform next things:

- set interface up if required
- create vlan tagged interface and set it up
- add required ipv4 settings for interface
- add default route

After verification teardown will be performed.
Teardown is best effort based - e.g we should not fail whole command
if we cant fully execute teardown.

The VirtCPUModel class currently uses anonymous enums for a
number of fields. Since some of the same enums will be required
in other objects, convert them to named enums instead.

The import of nova.compute.arch and nova.compute.cpumodel is
a temporary state. The intention is that the constants in those
two modules actually get moved into the enum classes themselves
allowing the modules to be removed. This is to be done in a
later commit.

The hash of VirtCPUModel changes because the field classname
has changed. The version is not incremented though, because

Added ability to use placeholders in datasource URLs. Currently
supported placeholders:
* %RANDSTR(len)% - will be replaced with random string of
  lowercase letters of length `len`.
* %JOB_EXEC_ID% - will be replaced with the job execution ID.

Resulting URLs will be stored in a new field at job_execution

is reserved for oozie status.

Next steps:
* write documentation
* update horizon

Provision fault tolerance makes it possible
to continue deployment even if some of nodes
failed while being provisioned. But if
reboot such failed node with chain loader
it likely can stick on this stage and we won't
be able to reboot it any way except turning it off
and on.

This change prevents failed nodes from being rebooted
with chain loader. Besides this patch sets
profile for IBP nodes into 'bootstrap', so as to
avoid them being booted with anaconda or debian-installer.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =========================== Porting Neutron to Python 3 =========================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/neutron-python3 Problem Description =================== Neutron currently only works with Python 2.x. As some OpenStack projects now work with Python 3 (most of the Python clients, some of the oslo libraries...), and since OpenStack must move to Python 3 [1], Neutron shall be ported to Python 3.4. Proposed Change =============== This specification details the steps needed to port Neutron to Python 3. By ""Neutron"", we only mean the code that can be found at https://github.com/openstack/neutron. The goal here is only to be able to run all the tests with Python 3.4. This may not be enough to make sure that Neutron is fully compatible with Python 3.4: we will also need to run Neutron in a devstack that uses Python 3.x, but this is another issue. Data Model Impact ----------------- None REST API Impact --------------- None Security Impact --------------- None Notifications Impact -------------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None IPv6 Impact ----------- None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- None Developer Impact ---------------- Once Neutron has been ported to Python 3, developers will not able to write code that only works with Python 2. Community Impact ---------------- None Alternatives ------------ None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: cyril-roelandt Work Items ---------- * Fix issues with the dependencies that are not Python 3 compatible: jsonrpclib (that might be removed, see https://review.openstack.org/172912), oslo.context, oslo.db, oslo.messaging, paste. * Make sure ""tox -epy34"" only runs tests that are specifically listed in tox.ini; it does not matter if this list is empty. * Enable the py34 gate in Neutron and make it voting. We should now be able to avoid regressions while working. * Fix the most obvious issues (print statements, failing imports, ...) that can probably be caught by 2to3. * Fix all the tests, one by one. * Once they all work, remove the explicit list of tests to run when using Python 3 from tox.ini.

And finish of this group is required to consider that deploy_end is done. In parameters section for groups strategy can be specified, in 6.1 we are supporting next strategies: 1. parallel - all node in this group will be executed in parallel, if there is other groups that doesnt depend on each other - they will be executed in parallel too, example is cinder and compute groups. 2. parallel by amount - run in parallel by specified number, like in controller example that number is 6. 3. one_by_one - deploy nodes in this group strictly one after another # TODO(dshulyak) add graph with groups for 6.1 VOID ----- Making task a void - will guarantee that this task will not be executed, but all edges (dependnecies) of this task will be preserved. Example: :: - id: netconfig type: void groups: [primary-controller, controller, cinder, compute, ceph-osd, zabbix-server, primary-mongo, mongo] required_for: [deploy_end] requires: [logging] parameters: puppet_manifest: /etc/puppet/modules/osnailyfacter/other_path/netconfig.pp puppet_modules: /etc/puppet/modules timeout: 3600 PUPPET ------ Task of type puppet is preferable way to execute deployment code on nodes, it is in fact the only mco agent that are capable of executing code in background And in 6.1 it is the only task that is allowed to be used in main deployment stages, between (deploy_start and deploy_end). Example: :: - id: netconfig type: puppet groups: [primary-controller, controller, cinder, compute, ceph-osd, zabbix-server, primary-mongo, mongo] required_for: [deploy_end] requires: [logging] parameters: puppet_manifest: /etc/puppet/modules/osnailyfacter/other_path/netconfig.pp puppet_modules: /etc/puppet/modules timeout: 3600 SHELL ----- Shell tasks should be used outside of main deployment procedure. Basically it will just execute the blocking command on specified roles. Example: :: - id: enable_quorum type: shell role: [primary-controller] requires: [post_deployment_start] required_for: [post_deployment_end] parameters: cmd: ruby /etc/puppet/modules/osnailyfacter/modular/astute/enable_quorum.rb timeout: 180 UPLOAD_FILE ------------ TODO SYNC ------------ TODO COPY_FILES ----------- TODO REBOOT --------- TODO ================== API ================== If you want to change/add some tasks right on master node, just add tasks.yaml and appropriate manifests in folder for release that you are interested in. Then apply this command: >> fuel rel --sync-deployment-tasks --dir /etc/puppet Also you may want to overwrite deployment tasks for any specific release/cluster by next commands: >> fuel rel --rel <id> --deployment-tasks --download >> fuel rel --rel <id> --deployment-tasks --upload >> fuel env --env <id> --deployment-tasks --download >> fuel env --env <id> --deployment-tasks --upload After this is done - you will be able to run customized graph of tasks: The most basic command: >> fuel node --node 1,2,3 --tasks upload_repos netconfig Developer will need to specify nodes that should be used in deployment and tasks ids. Order in which they are provided doesn't matter, it will be computed from dependencies specified in database. Also very important to understand that if task is mapped to role controller, but node where you want to apply that task doesn't have this role - it wont be executed. Skipping of tasks >> fuel node --node 1,2,3 --skip netconfig hiera List of task that are provided with this parameter will be skipped during graph traversal in nailgun. The main question is - should we skip other task that have provided tasks as dependencies? In my opinion we can leave this flag as simple as it is, and use following commands for ""smarter"" traversal. Specify start and end nodes in graph: >> fuel node --node 1,2,3 --end netconfig Will deploy everything up to netconfig task, including netconfig. This is: all tasks that we are considering as pre_deployment (keys generation, rsync manifests, sync time, upload repos), and such tasks as hiera setup, globals computation and maybe some other basic preparatory tasks. >> fuel node --node 1,2,3 --start netconfig Start from netconfig, including netconfig, deploy all other tasks, tasks that we are considering as post_deployment. For example if one want to execute only netconfig successors: >> fuel node --node 1,2,3 --start netconfig --skip netconfig And user will be able to use start and end at the same time: >> fuel node --node 1,2,3 --start netconfig --end upload_cirros Nailgun will build path that includes only necessary tasks to join this two points. ============= LIMITATIONS ============= Only puppet in main deployment for 6.1 --------------------------------------- All agents except puppet are working in blocking way, and our deployment model can not execute some tasks that are blocking and non blocking. This is part of technical debt that can be easily resolved with mistral. In pre/post deployment stages any of the supported task drivers can be used. No cross dependencies between groups ------------------------------------------------------------------ We can not provide a model right now that will allow to run some tasks on primary-controller, than run on controller, and then get back to primary-controller. In 6.1 cross-dependencies will be solved by post deployment stage. Cross dependency will be available when we will have orchestrator with convenient graph based api, like mistral. ============= EXAMPLES ============= Additional task for existing role --------------------------------- Add task description in :: /etc/puppet/2014.2-6.1/modules/my_tasks.yaml - id: my_task type: puppet groups: [compute] required_for: [deploy_end] requires: [netconfig] parameters: puppet_manifest: /etc/puppet/modules/my_task.pp puppet_modules: /etc/puppet/modules timeout: 3600 And run :: fuel rel --sync-deployment-tasks --dir /etc/puppet/2014.2-6.1 After syncing task to nailgun database - you will be able to deploy it on selected groups. In this example it will be deployed after netconfig. Swapping a task with custom task ---------------------------------------- It is just a matter of changing path to executable file. :: - id: netconfig type: puppet groups: [primary-controller, controller, cinder, compute, ceph-osd, zabbix-server, primary-mongo, mongo] required_for: [deploy_end] requires: [logging] parameters: # puppet_manifest: /etc/puppet/modules/osnailyfacter/netconfig.pp /etc/puppet/modules/osnailyfacter/custom_netwrok_configuration.pp puppet_modules: /etc/puppet/modules timeout: 3600 Creating separate role and attach task for it ----------------------------------------------- # NOTE(dshulyak) role creation is not in master yet, but will be soon :: Create a file with redis.yaml with content meta: description: Simple redis server name: Controller name: redis volumes_roles_mapping: - allocate_size: min id: os Create a role with fuel role --rel 1 --create --file redis.yaml After this is done you can go on Fuel UI and see that we created a role redis, and now can attach tasks for it. Install redis puppet module puppet module install thomasvandoren-redis Write simple manifest at /etc/puppet/modules/redis/example/simple_redis.pp include redis Create configuration for fuel in /etc/puppet/modules/redis/example/redis_tasks.yaml :: # redis group - id: redis type: group role: [redis] required_for: [deploy_end] tasks: [globals, hiera, netconfig, install_redis] parameters: strategy: type: parallel # Install simple redis server - id: install_redis type: puppet requires: [netconfig] required_for: [deploy_end] parameters: puppet_manifest: /etc/puppet/modules/redis/example/simple_redis.pp puppet_modules: /etc/puppet/modules timeout: 180 fuel rel --sync-deployment-tasks --dir /etc/puppet/2014.2-6.1/ Create enviroment - properly configure public network (because redis packages fetched from upstream) - enable public network on all interfaces Provision redis node: fuel node --node 1 --env 1 --provision Finish installation on install_redis (no need to execute all different tasks from post_deployment) fuel node --node 1 --end install_redis Moving existing services to separate node -------------------------------------------- The main problem with moving services around is that there is a lot of cross-dependencies between those services. Lets take a look at separation of rabbitmq process (also we will need disable creation of rabbitmq resources in pacemaker) :: Create a file with rabbitmq.yaml with content meta: description: Rabbitmq cluster name: Rabbitmq name: rabbitmq volumes_roles_mapping: - allocate_size: min id: os fuel role --rel 1 --create --file rabbitmq.yaml :: # provide information when this role should be deployed - id: rabbitmq type: group role: [rabbitmq] required_for: [primary-controller] parameters: strategy: type: parallel # task that will install rabbitmq server - id: rabbitmq_installation type: puppet requires: [netconfig] required_for: [controller_services] groups: [rabbitmq] # groups: [controller, primary-controller] parameters: puppet_manifest: /etc/puppet/modules/rabbitmq.pp pupput_modules: /etc/puppet/modules timeout: 1200 # change endpoints of rabbitmq hosts on other nodes - id: change_rabbitmq_endpoints type: puppet requires: [globals, hiera] # all tasks that depends on galera endpoints required_for: [compute_services, cinder_services, contoroller_services, haproxy] groups: [compute, cinder, controller] parameters: puppet_manifest: /etc/puppet/modules/change_galera_endpoints.pp puppet_modules: /etc/puppet/modules timeout: 180 Perform sync and assign rabbitmq role as standalone or as part of controller. Extending deployment with ansible ---------------------------------- TODO ",,463,0

She builds an SVN repository and uploads the baseline configuration files there for service teams to modify and deploy through tool automation. User and group accounts for each service are created with the principle of least privilege in mind. Service teams also have their roles defined, and are given or denied access as well. For example, the development team is not given production access, however an escalation path is outlined through Alice's Security Operations Center where privileges can be added and audited during issues. Additionally, an update and patching policy is created, with tiered criticalities for normal updates compared to security or other critical fixes that may be more time sensitive. </para> <para> For out-of-band management Alice has included a BMC/IPMI version specification for the 'Request for Pricing' (RFP) which she submits to approved hardware vendors for quotes and system specifications. This includes ensuring communication with the out-of-band management interface can be encrypted with TLS for both textual and GUI access. She ensures that a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) will be monitoring the management security domain that the IPMI traffic will be using.

Before deploying her private cloud, Alice has completed her system documentation. Specifically she has identified which OpenStack services will exist in each security domain.

It will also enable Alice to report periodically on the state of her cloud and perform remediation to a known state should anything be out of the ordinary.

Alice configures nova-network in with the VLAN Network Manager so that each tenant will have its own virtual network, keeping in mind the VLAN trunking will stress the environment and the scaling limit of 4096 tenants. She is aware that all traffic will pass through the virtual networking appliance, however she is comfortable with this given the hardware positioned to support the VLAN trunking across the entire environment. Additionally, as the nova-network hypervisor enforces the security group rules via iptables, invalid traffic will not be an issue. To ensure this, she designates a quarterly review of the security group rules for each VLAN. She understands there is no overlapping IP space and has ensured the deployment systems have separate IP ranges with room for growth until the migration to Neutron occurs. </para>"," <para>A key objective of Alice's cloud is to integrate with the existing auth services and security resources. The key design parameters for this private cloud are a limited scope of tenants, networks and workload type. This environment can be designed to limit what available network resources are available to the tenant and what are the various default quotas and security policies are available. The network policy engine can be modified to restrict creation and changes to network resources. In this environment, Alice might want to leverage nova-network in the application of security group polices on a per instance basis vs. neutron's application of security group polices on a per port basis. L2 isolation in this environment would leverage VLAN tagging. The use of VLAN tags will allow great visibility of tenant traffic by leveraging existing features and tools of the physical infrastructure.</para>",22,15

This allows hacking checks to be added as optional which means
that they are assumed to be excluded and have to be explicitly
added as part of a 'select' entry in the [flake8]
stanza of tox.ini.

The goal is to allow checks to be staged into the projects instead
of requiring all of the projects to change to adhere to the
check prior to the check being added (which creates a window where
failing code could be added).  Instead checks can be staged in with
enforcement and once all (or the majority) of projects have enabled
it, the check can be changed to a required check.

One optional check is added as an example:
  H106: Don't put vim configuration in source files

Users can define policies in congress by pure Datalog. But Datalog, working with data-tables, is a very difficult and complex description for policies. Users may have some problems to understand and deploy policies by Datalog. So this specification provides an abstraction for policies, and show it in an abstraction form in Horizon, which will facilitate users to express their policies.Datalog is not intuitive to use, even difficult for users to express users’ policy who are not familiar with it. And it may cause some misinterpretation when translate real intent to Datalog because of the complex logic.Congress makes the whole cloud compliant by defining violation state and action for violation. Policies in Congress can be expressed by BNF as below. Congress Policy ::= violation condition, “do” action for violation So, policy abstraction is to abstract violation state and corresponding action to make the policy more intuitive and easy to use. By analyzing typical scenarios, violation mainly can be divided into two parts. One is the constraint of objects’ attributes, and another is the constraint of relationship between several objects’ attributes. All the objects and constraints are not just a simple set of data source tables, but they can be divided into some categories according to their functions and relations. So users just need to choose objects they care about without worrying about which tables they are in. The violation condition can be expressed by BNF as below. violation condition ::= {condition} condition::=object attribute constraint (value | object attribute) object attribute::=object “.” attribute For any violation state, congress will take some actions, such as monitoring, proactive and reactive. Though congress just takes monitoring for violation, changing cloud state to make the cloud compliant is also an important function for congress. So, policy abstraction will provide some optional reactive actions for different objects to resolve violation. The action for violation state can be expressed by BNF as below. action ::= (“monitor”| “proactive”| “reactive”) data So policies in Congress can be abstracted into ""name"", ""objects"", ""violation condition"", ""action"" and ""data"". Among these, element “name” defines a marker of a policy, which is used to be a unique identification for a policy; element “objects” defines all objects which are concerned by this policy. They are not just simple display of data source tables, but a organized set which contains the relationship between different objects, such as, ""servers"", ""networks"", ""hosts"", ""subnets"", etc. For example, table ""statistics"" will not appear as a object, but it will be a attribute of other objects, such as, ""servers"", ""networks"". Another example is users could choose server and networks without caring about what put them together (""ports"", actually); element “violation condition” defines the state of objects' attributes which can produce violation, and the constraint will include comparison, arithmetic and some predefined relationship/functions, such as, ""same_group""; element “action” defines the action needs to take for this policy, and actions will include ""proactive"", ""monitoring"" and some specific actions, such as, ""remove"", ""delete""; element “data” defines the information gotten or needed when execute the action, for example, when monitor a servers violation, users can define ""data"" is servers' name to be a return parameters. Based on the policy expressed by Datalog, admin will decide which parameters or actions can be exposed. Users can write their policy just through several drop-down lists or some simple inputs. Then UI translates the information in UI to Datalog. That is, admin will determine which policies can be expressed in UI, users choose which one can match their needs. All parameters appear in UI will be extensible and will cover most of application scenarios.There is one example to express typical policy by abstraction form in Horizon. Example: every network connected to a VM must either be public or owned by someone in the same group as the VM. For this example, users care about ""servers"" and ""networks"", so users will choose these two objects from a drop-down list. After users decide the objects, corresponding optional violation state will be decided, which will include these two objects’ attributes and some predefined relationship, so users can choose ""not same_group"" and choose who are not in the same group. All the choices will be show as drop-down lists, too. And users need to choose the action and data for this violation. For example, users choose ""monitoring"", attributes of servers and networks will appear in ""data"". In this policy, users can create a policy as below. +------ ---+----------+-----------------------------------------------+------------+--------------+ | name | objects | violation state | action | data | +------ ---+----------+-----------------------------------------------+------------+--------------+ | policy_1 | servers |not equal(networks.share, public) | monitoring | servers.name | | | networks |not same_group(servers.tenant, networks.tenant)| | | +------ ---+----------+-----------------------------------------------+------------+--------------+ The action can be monitoring, proactive or some execute actions which can make the cloud compliant.All parameters inputted by users need satisfy the standard.End users can be able to write policies in Horizon and use some drop-down lists and some simple inputs to create a policy. Then Horizon will translate the information in UI into Datalog, which will be processed in Congress.Other contributors:- Build mapping relationship between abstraction form and Datalog, and users can write a policy in UI other than Datalog.Need to be tested by a variety of scenarios.Document will add instructions for policy abstraction in UI."," License.Congress aims to provide an extensible open-source framework for governance and regulatory compliance across any cloud services. Users can define policies in congress by pure Datalog. But Datalog, working with data-tables, is a very abstract and complex description for policies. Users may have some problems to understand and deploy policies by Datalog. So this specification describes an abstraction for policies, and mappings it to Datalog. And the Ultimate goal is to introduce a more simple and intuitive DSL (Domain Specific Language) to express policies in Congress.Datalog is a not institutional, even difficult for users to express users’ policy who are not familiar with it. And it may cause some misinterpretation when translate the real intent to Datalog because of the complex logic. Congress makes the whole cloud compliance by defining violation state and action for violation. Congress Policy ::= violation condition “do” action for violation So, policy abstraction is to abstract violation state and corresponding action to make the policy more intuitional and easy to use. This specification will provide an abstraction for all policies in congress, and show it in an abstraction form in Horizon. By analyzing typical scenarios, violation state mainly can be divided into two parts. One part is the constraint of objects’ attributes, and another is the constraint of relationship between several objects’ attributions. All the objects and constraints are not just a simple set of data source tables, but they can be divided into some categories according to their functions and connected by some relations. So users just need to choose objects they care about without warring about which tables they are in. violation condition ::= {condition} condition::=object attribute constraint (value | object attribute ) object attribute::=object “.” attribute For any violation state, congress will take some actions, such as monitoring, proactive and reactive. Though congress just takes monitoring for violation, changing cloud state to make the cloud compliance is also an important function for congress. So, policy abstraction will provide some optional reactive actions for different objects to resolve violation. action for violation ::= (“monitor”| “proactive”| “reactive”) data So in the abstraction policy UI, user will input policy name, select objects, define violation condition, action and related data. Among these, element “name” defines the sign of a policy; element “objects” defines all objects which are concerned by this policy; element “violation condition” defines the expression of object’s attributes which can produce violation; element “action” defines the action needs to take for this policy; element “data” defines the information gotten or needed when execute the action. Based on the policy expressed by Datalog, admin will decide which parameters or actions can be exposed. Users can write their policy just through several drop-down lists or some simple inputs, and these parameters will express users’ policy. For the purpose of express users’ intent easily and intuitionally, our ultimate goal is to introduce a DSL in congress, which has a unified model has the ability to improve users’ communication in a specific domain. Users can express their intent policy by congress DSL easily and clearly.There is one example to express typical policy by abstraction form in Horizon. Example: every network connected to a VM must either be public or owned by someone in the same group as the VM. In this case, the state of violation is “the network connected VM is not public, and its owner is not same_group with VM’s”. When the violation happens, system will inform admin the vm’s id. So this policy can be expressed by abstraction form as bellow. *name:policy_1;* *objects: vm, network;* *violation conditions: network.share==no, not same_group( vm.tenant,network.tenant);* *actions: monitoring;* *data: vm.id;* Users can set action for a policy in field “action”. The action can be monitoring, proactive or some execute actions which can make the cloud compliance.Parameters inputted by users must in consistent with Datalog.End users can be able to write policies in Horizon and use some drop-down lists and some simple inputs to create a policy in Congress.Other contributors: - Build mapping relationship between abstraction form and Datalog, and users can write a policy in UI other than Datalog.

There is a long-standing issue with netfilter enablement on bridges

Neutron requires this enabled as documented in [2].  This change
allows centos7+neutron to pass the security group tests in tempest.

I will investigate why neutron can't do this itself.  Ubuntu don't
notice because their defaults are on.  Other than the documentation
change in [2], it seems we also work around this in other deployment

    The create_service action only checks to see if a service
    with the same uuid exists, and if it does, it skips.  This
    addition checks to see whether a service matches the fields

    It looks like the create_endpoint action already does this.
    Used the same process for checking the service.

The 'name' field for some resources is called something different,
for example 'display_name' for volumes, 'name' for  volumes type.
So class 'resource' has attribute 'NAME_ATTR' wich contains
attribute name for different resources.

This change removes reduntant call find in resource manager, instead
of it checks NAME_ATTR value.

When an instance is destroyed, it is stopped first. The manager
will get the event and consider it an unexpected power off, so
it will try to call the stop API as well.

Meanwhile, the instance might be deleted, in which case the above
operation will fail with an ""NotFound"" error.

This can be avoided by catching this in the power off method.

The named pipe handler stop method checks if the 'stopped' event
was set before attempting to perform cleanup. The issue is if one
worker fails, it will set this event, preventing the stop method
from performing the cleanup.

In this case, the VM console log files will remain open, unable to
be deleted when the VM is destroyed.

This check can be safely removed.

The serial console handler is now stopped in case some workers
fail to start, avoiding the above mentioned situation.

The named pipe handler stop method checks if the 'stopped' event
was set before attempting to perform cleanup. The issue is if one
worker fails, it will set this event, preventing the stop method
from performing the cleanup.

In this case, the VM console log files will remain open, unable to
be deleted when the VM is destroyed.

This check can be safely removed.

The serial console handler is now stopped in case some workers
fail to start, avoiding the above mentioned situation.

When an instance is destroyed, it is stopped first. The manager
will get the event and consider it an unexpected power off, so
it will try to call the stop API as well.

Meanwhile, the instance might be deleted, in which case the above
operation will fail with an ""NotFound"" error.

This can be avoided by catching this in the power off method.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ======================= Adopt Oslo Guru reports ======================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/guru-meditation-report This spec proposes adoption for Oslo Guru reports in Neutron. The new feature will enhance debugging capabilities of all official Neutron services, by providing an easy way to gather runtime data about current threads and configuration, among other things, to developers, operators, and tech support. Problem Description =================== Currently Neutron does not have a way to gather runtime data from active service processes. The only information that is available to deployers, developers, and tech support to analyze is what was actually logged by the service in question. Additional data could be usefully used to debug and solve problems that occur during Neutron operation. Among other things, we could be interested in stack traces of all (both green and real) threads, pid/ppid info, package version, configuration as seen by the service, etc. Oslo Guru reports provide an easy way to add support for gathering this kind of information to any service. Report generation is triggered by sending a special (USR1) signal to a service. Reports are generated on stderr, that can be piped into system log, if needed. Guru reports are extensible, meaning that we will be able to add more information to those reports in case we see it needed. For example, we could add a new report section for L2 Open vSwitch agent to dump flows and other relevant networking data to the report. Note that this spec does not cover any of possible extensions and just lays the foundation for them. Guru reports are supported by Nova. Proposed Change =============== First, a new oslo-incubator module (reports.*) should be synchronized into neutron tree. Then, each service entry point should be extended to register reporting functionality before proceeding to its real main(). This may be achieved through utilizing neutron/cmd/__init__.py or a similar way that would automatically expose the functionality to all services. After neutron core repository adopts the feature, advanced services' repositories will be similarly updated to utilize the module. Data Model Impact ----------------- None. REST API Impact --------------- None. Security Impact --------------- In theory, the change could expose service internals to someone who is able to send the needed signal to a service. That said, we can probably assume that the user is already authorized to achieve a lot more than just having an access to stack traces and configuration used. Also, if deployers are afraid of the information leak for some reason, they could also make sure their stderr output is channeled into safe place. Notifications Impact -------------------- None. Other End User Impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ The feature does not require any additional resources until it's triggered by the user. Default report generation is not expected to take too long. Report extensions will need to be assessed on case by case basis. In any case, reports are not expected to be generated too often and are assumed to be debugging capability, not something to trigger once per minute just in case. IPv6 Impact ----------- None. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- Deployers may be interested in making sure those reports are collected somewhere (e.g. stderr should be captured by syslog). Developer Impact ---------------- None. Community Impact ---------------- None. Alternatives ------------ We could reimplement the wheel, but we hopefully won't. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- ihrachyshka Work Items ---------- * sync reports.* module from oslo-incubator * adopt it in all neutron services using a wrapper located under neutron/cmd/... Note: the feature was once proposed for inclusion but was later abandoned: https://review.openstack.org/#/q/project:openstack/neutron+topic:bp/guru-meditation-report,n,z Dependencies ============ reports.* module is currently going thru graduation consideration. In case it's graduated into oslo.reports library before neutron switches to it, we won't actually need to sync any code from oslo-incubator but instead add a new external oslo dependency. If Neutron switches to the module before graduation is complete, then we'll need to adopt oslo.reports later as part of usual oslo liaison effort. Testing ======= Ideally, the feature would be tested using full stack testing framework that was expected to enter the tree in Kilo but was postponed to Liberty. Note that the framework is not yet reproposed for Liberty. Tempest Tests ------------- None. Functional Tests ---------------- None. API Tests --------- None. Documentation Impact ==================== User Documentation ------------------ Documentation should be extended to describe the new feature. Developer Documentation ----------------------- Developer documentation should be updated to include information on how to add support for the reporting feature. Special attention should be made on those who implement Neutron extensions out of tree.

This is a simple approach\nthat will work when multiple jobs are running, as the same config is used.\n\nI did try to modify the vpnaas.filters file to pass an arg that points\nto the rootwrap.conf in the .tox area, but the script is not ""seeing""\nthat argument, and only sees the user args passed in for the script.\n\nAnother alternative I considered, was to create a test version of the\nnetns_wrapper.py file, but I don\'t know how to set the default value for\nthe rootwrap.conf to point to the .tox area with the specific job name.\nIt could be hard-coded for the dsvm-functional-sswan job, but if tests\nare added to the dsvm-functional job, then this would break (or multiple\nscripts that are nearly identical, would be needed).\n\nA third possible solution, which could be done in a follow-up commit (as\nwe need to get functional tests running w/o stacking ASAP), is to have\nthe VPN driver obtain the rootwrap.conf file from vpnagent.ini file, and\nexplicitly pass this into the neutron-vpn-netns-wrapper script, along\nwith the --cmd, and --mount-paths args. The tests could override the config.\nThis would give a realistic way to customize the rootwrap settings (right\nnow, I don\'t see how the file can be overridden).\n\nTo configure the environment for local run of the functional test, one\ncan do:\n    tools/configure_for_vpn_func_testing.sh \\\n        <func-job-name> <devstack-repo> [-i]\n\nwhere:\n   func-gate-name..

This commit does several things to allow functional tests to run, using a
DevStack configuration, but without stacking.

First, the gate_hook.sh is modified to specified environment variables
needed for processing, and will call configure_vpn_for_func_testing.sh.

The new configure_for_vpn_func_testing.sh script will first call the Neutron
configure_for_func_testing.sh script (as modified in [1]) to setup DevStack.
The script then installs the IPSec package, based on the functional job, and
will create the vpn_agent.ini file, in case it is needed for tests.

Minor changes are made to the post-test_hook.sh to indicate the location for
the Neutron and VPN repos.

Lastly, tox.ini is modified to place the rootwrap related files into the
virtual environment, copy in the VPN rootwrap filter, set up the rootwrap
commands, and copy the (customized) rootwrap.conf to /etc/neutron.

This last step is needed, because the neutron-vpn-netns-wrapper script that
is (currently) used for StrongSwan, uses /etc/neutron/rootwrap.conf and
doesn't allow overriding. This copying is a simple approach that will work
when multiple functional jobs are running, as the same config is used.

As a future follow-up commit, we could look into modifying the VPN device
drivers to pass the full path to the rootwrap.conf as a argument to the
neutron-vpn-netns-wrapper script (--rootwrap_config). The setting could
be added to the vpnagent.ini config file, available via config, to allow
this to be customized to something other than /etc/neutron (for production
use), and the functional tests could override it to point to the right
virtual environment.

To configure the environment for local run of the functional test, one
can do:
    tools/configure_for_vpn_func_testing.sh <devstack-repo> [-i]

The retype command does not do any checking with the
filter scheduler and blindly sends a driver.retype call
to the backend.  This is bad, because the drivers
expect to receive type specifications that have been
checked by the filter-scheduler before being sent to them.

Most drivers just ignore invalid keys/capabilites, and only
check those keys that are valid for them.  They assume things
like volume_backend_name are correct, otherwise they wouldn't
have received the call.

This patch is a partial fix to at least filter/check on
volume_backend_name, and also to allow the filter to pass
if there is only a single service with the cinder-volume topic.

The full fix is to implement a check via the scheduler to verify
that what's being attempted is valid regardless of migration or not.

This patch implements tunable configuration parameters for keystone.conf
as follows:
 - keystone_conf_settings: the default settings implemented by the
   keystone role
 - keystone_conf_tunables: the attribute available to use for overriding
   default settings and implementing additional settings

An example of how the tunables may be used is in:
 - etc/openstack_deploy/conf.d/tunables.yml.example

In order to achieve this the jinja2 do extension is enabled and a task is
added to the keystone role to merge the tunables into the settings. The
configuration file is then output using a generic template which iterates
through the settings to construct the file appropriately.

There are a number of drivers that inherit from the base
iscsi driver, using the base implementation of initialize_connection
and terminate_connection.  These drivers also don't have iscsi_helper
defined.

We've kept all iscsi_helper specific code in the tgt helpers
themselves, or in the various versions of the LVM driver
which is where they belong.

Over time however there have been some iscsi_helper specific
calls that have crept in to the base volume.driver:ISCSIDriver
class.  These were LIO specific calls and as a result when a
configuration is set with multi-backend to use lioadm as the
target helper, or even if it's not used but the default iscsi_helper
is set to lioadm the initialize_connection and terminate_connection
calls will try and access the LIO specific calls and raise because
the drivers inheriting from this class don't have target_helper
members.

This went unnoticed mostly because there's no significant LIO testing
in place and there were no distros setting LIO as the default iscsi_helper,
it appears that this has changed however.

This patch moves the LIO specific calls back where they belong
and keeps the base ISCSIDriver generic.  I've also added a test
case for this in the SolidFire driver because it's impacted by
this.

A path traversal attack is when an attacker supplies input that gets used with our path to access a file on the file system that we did not intend. The input usually attempts to break out of the application's working directory and access a file elsewhere on the file system. This category of attack can be mitigated by restricting the scope of file system access and reducing attack surface by using a restricted file permission profile. Incorrect ~~~~~~~~~ A typical remote vector for path traversal in web applications might involve serving or storing files on the file system. Consider the following example: .. code:: python import os from flask import Flask, redirect, request, send_file app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/') def cat_picture(): image_name = request.args.get('image_name') if not image_name: return 404 return send_file(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), image_name)) if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True) As the attacker controls the input that is used directly in constructing a path they are able to access any file on the system. For example consider what happens if an attacker makes a request like: :: curl http://example.com/?image_name=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd Path traversal flaws also can happen when unpacking a compressed archive of files. An example of where this has happened within OpenStack is `OSSA-2011-001 <http://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2011-001.html>`__. In this case a tar file from an untrusted source could be unpacked to overwrite files on the host operating system. .. code:: python import tarfile def untar_image(path, filename): tar_file = tarfile.open(filename, 'r|gz') tar_file.extract_all(path) image_file = tar_file.get_names()[0] tar_file.close() return os.path.join(path, image_file) Correct ~~~~~~~ The following example demonstrates how you can use python code to restrict access to files within a specific directory. This can be used as a mechanism to defeat path traversal. .. code:: python import os import sys def is_safe_path(basedir, path, follow_symlinks=True): # resolves symbolic links if follow_symlinks: return os.path.realpath(path).startswith(basedir) return os.path.abspath(path).startswith(basedir) def main(args): for arg in args: if is_safe_path(os.getcwd(), path): print(""safe: {}"".format(arg)) else: print(""unsafe: {}"".format(arg)) if __name__ == ""__main__"": main(sys.argv[1:]) Another approach to restricting file system access to maintain an indirect mapping between a unique identifier and a file path that exists on the operating system.

Explicitly deleting will prevent attempting to resize down an instance
that was used for other resize tests. Every resize test will get its own
server.

Because there is now no potential to be resizing back and forth between
flavor_ref and flavor_ref_alt we can do away with the code that tried to
figure out what the direction should be. Resizes will now always be from
flavor_ref to flavor_ref_alt, another protection against attempting to
resize down.

This does add extra work, deleting a server after each test and making a
new one, however as it does away with resize direction ambiguity and
happy accidental successes the performance hit is worth it.

Unfortunately, we have a puppet run inside containers on each start and
that's cause to the situation when old containers install new packages
on restart. We don't have this issue before because our containers won't
restarted during upgrade process and now they do (because of upgrading
Docker package).

As workaround, we have to:

* backup all data before starting upgrades
* stop supervisor before host system puppet run, so containers won't be
  restarted and hence won't install new packages

Still, it's hackish.. but I don't know better solution now :(

pinning

This fixes a race between the claimed CPUs of an instance being
persisted to the DB, and the resource audit scanning the DB for
instances and subtracting pinned CPUs from the list of available CPUs.

The problem only shows up when the following sequence happens:
1) instance A (with dedicated cpus) boots on a compute node
2) resource audit runs on that compute node
3) instance B (with dedicated cpus) boots on the same compute node

The bug is that the claimed numa topology isn't updated until
after we release COMPUTE_RESOURCES_SEMAPHORE, so when the resource
audit retrieves the list of instances the numa_topology hasn't
been updated yet for the most recent one.

The fix is to persist the claimed numa topology before releasing
COMPUTE_RESOURCES_SEMAPHORE.

The base driver initialize_connection method includes
a specific check for lioadm iscsi_helper.  This check
when True results in a call to lio initialize_connection.

The problem is not all backends need/use the iscsi_helper
conf settings, but if it's set, it will always evaluate
during the initialize_connection call and try to call the
drivers method, which in a number of cases won't exist.

This is particularly problematic as more customers are moving
to RHEL based Juno deployments which configure LIO as the default
iscsi_helper.

The fix for this is simple, just use self.configuration so that
the check is only for the instantiation of the driver being used.

There are a number of places in the base driver that maybe should
be switched from CONF to self.configuration, but changing all of
them is high risk for a backport to Juno.

NOTE:  There is no cherry pick to pull back for this change.  The
target code was rewritten in Kilo making this bug obsolete, but
also resulting in no change to backport.

There is a 15-character limit on virtual disk names, imposed by VIOS
(but not by the PowerVM REST API).  There is no such limit for SSP LUs.
The recently-changed disk name generation algorithm allowed vdisk names
to exceed 15 characters, causing errors like:

This change set adds an optional 'short' parameter to the private
_get_disk_name helper which causes it to limit the generated name to 15
characters.  The localdisk driver is changed to use this new parameter.
Unit tests are improved such that they no longer mock _get_disk_name,
and such that they verify both of its variants.

Cinder volumes are organized under vCenter inventory folder
with name given by config option vmware_volume_folder. During
volume creation, this folder is created only if it doesn't
exist. Concurrent volume create operations when there is no
such folder can result in a race condition-- some of the
create operations will fail due to already existing folder.
This patch fix this by ignoring the exception and returning a
reference to the existing folder.

libvirt added support for _RELATIVE flag in v1.2.7 and when available this
flag _must_ be used to ensure backing paths are maintained relative during
snapshot delete operations.

This patch uses _RELATIVE flag if available, for both blockCommit and
blockRebase cases for both file and network backed disks.

If _RELATIVE flag is unavailable, it raises excp for blockCommit case
(since we can't get relative paths and Cinder flow is broken), but only
puts out a warning message for blockRebase case (since relative paths
works even for older libvirt)

Currently migrate_volume() in lvm.py does not pass volume size in
MiB but passes volume size in GiB to copy_volume(). The size argument
of copy_volume() requires MiB value. As a result, if the volume size
is 1GiB, copy_volume() copies only 1MiB head of 1GiB volume to the
destination volume, and then the volume data is corrupted.
This patch fixes to pass volume size in MiB.
