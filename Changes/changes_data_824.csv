Change Ie5d47f55 removed the last direct caller of Image.cache().
However, we intentionally continued to test calls to cache() to
provide assurance that we had not unintentionally changed existing
behaviour.

This patch updates existing tests to instead test calls to
create_from_image and create_from_func because:

* We intend to remove Image.cache() during this series.

* RefactorShimTestCase tests calls below create_from_image and
  create_from_func more thoroughly than higher level tests which test
  cache() directly.

* Because they carry additional context, we can easily test all
  expected arguments to create_from_image and create_from_func, so
  existing tests become more thorough.

We delete test_create_image_not_exist_no_fallback and
test_create_image_not_exist_fallback because they are entirely covered
by RefactorShimTestCase, and no longer make sense at the higher level.

RefactorShimTestCase gets its own FakeImage class because it's the
only place in the tests we still want to expose Image.cache() as an
interface.

With the Design Summit functions being split between the OpenStack
Summit and the Project Teams Gathering, the current wording in the
TC charter around election (which uses ""Design Summit"" and ""Summit""
interchangeably) is no longer valid.

This change clarifies the situation by:
* keeping PTL elections near to development cycle boundaries
  (but defining the timeframe relative to release rather than
  relative to an event)
* keeping TC elections on a 6-month spring/fall cadence,
  organizing them relative to the OpenStack Summit dates

The change is compatible with the language around TC elections
present in the OpenStack Foundation bylaws (esp. Appendix 4),
which mentions 6-month and one-year periods but does not attach
TC elections to events or cycles. This change therefore should
not require any change on the bylaws side.

While it tries to minimize impact, the net result of the change
is that TC elections are now separate from PTL elections (rather
than run just the week after).

This change also adds some flexibility in vote organization, by:

* using ""on or before"" language to allow election officials to
  work around holidays
* removing language around nomination periods (potentially allowing
  for the addition of ""campaign days"" between nomination and vote)
* lowering the minimum required amount of voting days to 4 business
  days (potentially allowing the vote to be organized within a week
  rather than forcing it to overlap with a weekend)

Problem Description =================== MFA is increasingly becoming a security standard, with TOTP being a good choice for passcode generation. OpenStack via Keystone does not currently support MFA and the current TOTP auth module is not useful for MFA. A true MFA solution for OpenStack needs to be optionally enabled on a per user basis, while MFA either blocking the APIs or requiring the APIs to accept an MFA passcode in some way. Proposed Change =============== Replace the default password auth method with on that combines the logic of the current one, but will also do a TOTP check if the user has a TOTP credential. Handle MFA by using the commonly accepted standard of concatenating username+password. This allows MFA to work with the APIs and Horizon without any work needed outside of Keystone. This spec will only handle per user MFA. Per user MFA makes the most sense, and it is how most people expect MFA to work. Attempting to handle per project MFA would require work across all OpenStack services to be able to support it, has a range of possible problems, and would require major refactoring in almost all areas. As such per project MFA is not worth the effort until a very good use case is put forward and until all other services are on board with supporting it. Alternatives ------------ Unknown Security Impact --------------- Improved security by allowing users with TOTP credentials to use MFA on their accounts. Notifications Impact -------------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- No change to normal users, the change only causes different behavior once a user has a TOTP credential associate with them, and even then the only change is that to use Horizon or the APIs they need to append their TOTP passcode to their password. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- None Developer Impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: adriant (Adrian Turjak <adriant@catalyst.net.nz>) Work Items ---------- * Update the password auth plugin to support TOTP. * Ensure all the current username/password tests still pass. * Write tests to ensure new functionality works as expect. * Write documentation for activation and use of TOTP. Dependencies ============ Not entirely dependant on, but a useful related change is Credential Encryption.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================================ Support ECKD volumes on Linux on System z ================================================================ https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/linux-ficon-support FICON (Fibre Connection) is a Fibre-Channel FC-4 layer protocol. It is used on mainframes to attach ECKD volumes via Fibre-Channel. Several changes are needed in order to allow Cinder to manage FICON-based block storage on Linux on System z. Besides, support is to be added to the existing Cinder drivers for storage subsystems supporting ECKD (for example, IBM DS8000). Required support in Nova is described by a separate blueprint which is listed as a dependency below. Problem description =================== FICON and FCP are Fibre-Channel FC-4 layer protocols. FICON uses a different scheme to address volumes, compared to FCP. * ECKD volumes are addressed by a Control Unit and Unit Address, rather than WWPN and LUN. * System z uses a different format for device file paths (ccw-based, rather than pci-based), similar to the file paths used for FCP on System z * ECKD volumes need to be set online and formatted before they can be used Use Cases ========= Allow an end-user to create and manage Cinder block devices based upon FICON attached storage subsystems supporting the ECKD protocol. For example: create, delete, image deploy, snapshot, .. We will extend a Cinder driver for IBMs DS8000. Other vendors, such as EMC, Hitachi, or HP support ECKD, too. They are potential candidates. Proposed change =============== Change code in os-brick to address these issues, dependent on a new protocol type of 'fibre_channel_eckd', provided by the driver For details, see section `Work Items`. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- Platforms that support FICON/ECKD will need to implement this for their drivers. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: stefan-amann Other contributors: arecknag maiera Work Items ---------- In ``os-brick/initiator/connector.py``: * provide a new connector FibreChannelECKDConnector * connect_volume needs to enable interrupts for the volume and set the volume online.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =================================== PCI-DSS API to Query Disabled Users =================================== `bp pci-dss-disabled-users-api <https://www.example.com>`_ Problem Description =================== With the current PCI-DSS implementation, expirations of user passwords in the database do not emit any form of notifications as it's caused by a passage of time, rather than a user-triggered event. For the purpose of PCI auditing, we will need to expose an API to allow a query for users who's accounts are disabled or locked-out. Proposed Change =============== A new API endpoint will be added to allow an administrator to query a list of disabled or locked-out users. This allows operators to set up jobs to generate necessary audit notifications. **Get List of Disabled Users** Gets a list of users who are currently locked-out or disabled. .. code-block:: bash POST /v3/users/disabled **Response** .. code-block:: json { ""links"": { ""next"": null, ""previous"": null, ""self"": ""http://example.com/identity/v3/users/disabled"" }, ""disabled_users"": [ { ""domain_id"": ""default"", ""enabled"": false, ""id"": ""514a66612f53412796952414898a6b99"", ""name"": ""someuser1"", ""links"": { ""self"": ""http://example.com/identity/v3/users/514a66612f53412796952414898a6b99"" }, ""password_expires_at"": ""2016-07-07T15:32:17.000000"" }, { ""domain_id"": ""default"", ""enabled"": false, ""id"": ""ce8a21d43bc64ce6840346f0a14a7fa9"", ""name"": ""someuser2"", ""links"": { ""self"": ""http://example.com/identity/v3/users/ce8a21d43bc64ce6840346f0a14a7fa9"" }, ""password_expires_at"": ""2016-11-12T00:21:04.000000"" }, ] } Alternatives ------------ Operators can directly query the SQL backend for disabled or locked-out users. Security Impact --------------- None. The added API change has no additional security impact. Notifications Impact -------------------- New notification will be emitted for PCI auditing. Other End User Impact --------------------- None. There will be no additional end user impact. Performance Impact ------------------ There will be no significant performance impact as the added API is expected to be invoked ad-hoc. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- None. The added API change has no additional deployer impact. Developer Impact ---------------- None. The added API change has no additional developer impact. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: gagehugo <gagehugo@gmail.com> Other contributors: lamt <tinlam@gmail.com> Work Items ---------- * Implement new API endpoint. * Implement notification for API endpoint. * Implement unit tests. * Document API endpoint usage. Dependencies ============ This blueprint depends on the following: * `PCI-DSS blueprint <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/pci-dss>`_ Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation in `api-ref` will be updated to include the added endpoint and its usage.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================== PCI-DSS Notifications ===================== Blueprint: `pci-dss-notifications <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/pci-dss-notifications>`_ Add notifications for various events for PCI auditing. Problem Description =================== PCI-DSS currently does not emit any notifications for specific scenarios such as a user getting locked out of their account after a number of attempts, or their password expiring after a set amount of days. Having notifications for these events would be beneficial for technical support and auditing purposes. Proposed Change =============== Add notifications for the following user-triggered events: * **PCI-DSS 8.1.6**: Limit repeated access attempts by locking out the user ID after not more than six attempts. * **PCI-DSS 8.2.3**: Passwords/passphrases must meet the following: * Require a minimum length of at least seven characters. * Contain both numeric and alphabetic characters. Alternatively, the passwords/passphrases must have complexity and strength at least equivalent to the parameters specified above. * **PCI-DSS 8.2.4**: Change user passwords/passphrases at least once every 90 days. * **PCI-DSS 8.2.5**: Do not allow an individual to submit a new password/passphrase that is the same as any of the last four passwords/passphrases he or she has used. * **Additional**: User attempting to change a password before a minimum password age elapsed. This prevents users from erasing password history to re-use an old password. If the event is triggered by a simple passage of time, e.g., a password/passphrase expired without an user action, a new API endpoint will be added to allow an administrator to query a list of disabled or locked-out users. This allows operators to set up jobs to generate necessary audit notifications. **Get List of Disabled Users** Gets a list of users who are currently locked-out or disabled. .. code-block:: bash GET /v3/users/disabled **Response** .. code-block:: json { ""links"": { ""next"": null, ""previous"": null, ""self"": ""http://example.com/identity/v3/users/disabled"" }, ""disabled_users"": [ { ""domain_id"": ""default"", ""enabled"": false, ""id"": ""514a66612f53412796952414898a6b99"", ""name"": ""someuser1"", ""links"": { ""self"": ""http://example.com/identity/v3/users/514a66612f53412796952414898a6b99"" }, ""password_expires_at"": ""2016-07-07T15:32:17.000000"" }, { ""domain_id"": ""default"", ""enabled"": false, ""id"": ""ce8a21d43bc64ce6840346f0a14a7fa9"", ""name"": ""someuser2"", ""links"": { ""self"": ""http://example.com/identity/v3/users/ce8a21d43bc64ce6840346f0a14a7fa9"" }, ""password_expires_at"": ""2016-11-12T00:21:04.000000"" }, ] } Alternatives ------------ Events can be logged and then parsed through log files. Expired or locked-out users can be queried directly through the SQL backend. Security Impact --------------- None. Notifications Impact -------------------- Additional notifications will be emitted for PCI-DSS events. Other End User Impact --------------------- None. There will be no other end user impact. Performance Impact ------------------ None. There will be no additional performance impact. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- None. There will be no other deployer impact. Developer Impact ---------------- None. There will be no developer impact. Implementation ============== Primary assignee: * gagehugo <gagehugo@gmail.com> Other contributors * jaugustine <ja224e@att.com> * lamt <tinlam@gmail.com> Work Items ---------- * Add notification to audit PCI-DSS events. * Implement API endpoint to query disabled or locked-out users. * Add unit tests. * Add API documentation. Dependencies ============ This blueprint depends on the following: `PCI-DSS blueprint <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/pci-dss>`_ Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation in `api-ref` will be updated to include the added endpoint and its usage.

By default RHEL/Centos has an /etc/sysconfig/iptables file which
allows ssh and icmp only (INPUT table). During the install of
OSP9/Mitaka usually the live iptables rules are not the ones in
/etc/sysconfig/iptables but they are completely open (in ACCEPT
policy, when the user has deployed with ManageFirewall: false, which
is the default in mitaka)

Now when we run the convergence step while migrating to Newton we enable
the firewall by default and this will actually first load the rules from
/etc/sysconfig/iptables and only afterwards, it will start adding all
the rules permitting openstack traffic. This causes an outage of roughly
1 minute in our env, which disrupts the cluster and fails the
convergence step. Let's simply move the existing file out of the way, it
will be recreated by puppet in newton with the proper firewall rules
anyway.

First observed via https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1391671

With this applied we saw no network connectivity loss during the
convergence step.

When trying to contact Ironic with a bad token, Forbidden exception
should be raised, in python3 a TypeError is raised due to json
lib being unable do decode a bytes object.

In order to be really python3 compatible, the json lib was replaced
with oslo.serialization module jsontuils since it's the recommended
migration to python3 guide. This is to ensure that data coming from
the requests lib can be read even if it's not string any more but
bytes.

 - This patch is to prefer the galaxy meta file and not duplicating
   the logic in the install role.
 - One advantage when using the meta galaxy file is when using external
   roles like this we can make use of the tags: skip_ansible_lint which
   doesn't seem to work well in the tests of the role.

Port security rules might contain rules that apply
to any protocol.

Currently there is no checking to see if a rule
which will be deleted belongs to a security
rule that applies to all protocols.

This patch addresses this issue by adding a check
to make sure the rule can be safely removed.

Doing the necessary to (1) keep ABC (we'll see), (2) make
getting the MRO (method resolution order) right less of a
black art, and (3) enabling future work, especially NFS
snapshots, which otherwise tends to break the existing
fragile ABC structure.

Key ideas (if they pan out):
  1) apply ABC only at the leaves of the inheritance
     hierarchy
  2) divide current ABC/methods with content classes
     into two classes, one for the ABC requirements,
     one for the bag of non-ABC methods in the current
     class.  This commit only does this for the BaseVD
     class, breaking out a BaseDriver class
     for the non-ABC methods that it supplies.
  3) rename interface classes (e.g., RemoteFS) to so that
     their function is clear.
  4) split the current NFSDriver class into an interface,
     which gets inherited, and a leaf driver class, since
     there is a standalone NFS driver.

In HA deployments, we now check mysql nodes every 1s and removed them
immediately if they are failed. Previously we would check every 2s and
allow them to fail 5 checks before being removed, producing errors from
other OpenStack services for 10s, which causes confusion and delay for

The Ceph Broker needs to be able to support ACL's on ceph pools
for cephx keys passed to clients, to allow permissions to be
better secured across a ceph cluster.

This spec covers the ACL design and the impact of this change
across the OpenStack charm set.

This change adds boot priorities to some container types where it'd be
beneficial. LXC allows containers with higher priority values to be
started ahead of others. The container default is 0 and all integers
greater than 0 will be started in descending order.

This change has no upgrade impact as the additional config is only used
on boot and will not require a container to be restarted.

This change ensures that stateful systems running within a container are started ahead of non-stateful systems. While this change has no impact on a running deployment it will assist with faster recovery should any node hosting container go down or simply need to be restarted. - A new task has been added to the ""os-lxc-container-setup.yml"" common-tasks file.

Starting in Ansible 2.0, the get_url [1] module provides the
ability for a checksum to be provided to the get_url module
which will be verified against the local destination file
and the task skipped if it matches.

[1] http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/get_url_module.html

This patch implements the use of this functionality.

The ability to ignore a venv download failure is also removed
as this is not necessary or desirable. It is better for the
download to fail and the playbook execution to stop immediately
so that the failure point is exposed.

Calling threading.Event.wait() when using eventlet results in a busy
loop calling epoll_wait, because the Python 2.x
threading.Condition.wait() implementation busy-waits by calling
sleep() with very small values (0.0005..0.05s).  Because sleep() is

It puzzles me why we would want to have it configurable. Having it = 0
is just plain bad (it breaks a floating IP roaming around HA routers),
having it = 1 may be unsafe if clients miss the update, having it more
than 3 (the default) is probably wasteful. That makes me think that
maybe we should not have it in the first place.

The patch that introduced the option also introduced the feature itself,
and does not provide any clue around why we would need it:
I125dbc57b90027dc5e99ff0a5d6877843a0b02a5

Maybe the option is in the tree because, in Assaf Muller's words, ""we're
a bunch of lazy developers that like to shift the responsibility to our
poor users that have to deal with thousands of configuration options"".

I suggest we just move with deprecation and removal here.

Currently, it's not possible to create duplicated tags for particular owner.
For, example you can not create tag with name 'test' for release. But, list of

I introduced definition 'namespace' to avoid described cases. It's spaces

I differentiate three kinds of tags namespaces:

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================ composable-multi-node-undercloud ================================ Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tripleo/+spec/heat-undercloud Deploy the undercloud with Heat instead of elements. This will allow us to use composable services for the Undercloud and better fits with the architecture of TripleO (providing a feedback loop between the Undercloud and Overcloud). Furthermore this gets us a step closer to an HA undercloud and will help us potentially convert the Undercloud to containers as work is ongoing in t-h-t for containers as well. Problem Description =================== The Undercloud today uses instack-undercloud. Instack undercloud is built around the concept of 'instack' which uses elements to install service. * When instack-undercloud started we shared elements across the undercloud and overcloud via the tripleo-image-elements project. This is no longer the case, thus we have lost * We retro-fitted instack-undercloud with a single element called puppet-stack-config that contains a single (large) puppet manifest for all the services. Being able to compose the Undercloud would be more scalable. * When we switched to instack-undercloud we removed the multi-node undercloud feature in TripleO. Not everyone is interested in this feature but some are and we'd ideally be able to support both cases with the same tooling (single and multi-node HA Underclouds). Proposed Change =============== Overview -------- We can use a single process Heat API/Engine in noauth mode to leverage recent ""composable services"" work in the tripleo-heat-templates project. * A new heat-all launcher will be created. * We will run the heat-all launcher with ""noauth"" middleware to skip keystone auth at a high level. * We will run the launcher with ""noauth"" middleware to skip keystone auth at a high level. * The heat-all process will use fake RPC driver and SQLite thus avoiding the need to run RabbitMQ or MySQL on the deployment server for bootstrapping. * To satisfy client library requirements inside heat we will run a fake keystone API (a thread in our installer perhaps), that will return just enough to make these clients functionally work in noauth mode. * The new ""deployed-server"" feature in tripleo-heat-templates will make it it possible to create Heat ""server"" objects and thus run OS::Heat::SoftwareDeployment resources on pre-installed servers. * We will use os-collect-config to communicate with the local Heat API via the Heat signal transport. We will run os-collect-config until the stack finished processing and either completes or fails. Alternatives ------------ * Create another tool which can read composable services in tripleo-heat-templates. This tool would be required to have feature parity with Heat such that things like parameters, nested stacks, environments all worked in a similar fashion so that we could share the template work across the Undercloud and Overcloud. This approach isn't really feasable. * Use an alternate tool like Ansible. This would creating duplicate services in Ansible playbooks for each service we require in the Undercloud. This approach isn't ideal in that it involves duplicate work across the Undercloud and Overcloud. Ongoing work around multi-node configuration and containers would need to be duplicated into both the Overcloud (tripleo-heat-templates) and Undercloud (Ansible) frameworks. Security Impact --------------- * The approach would run Heat on a single node in noauth mode. Heat API and the fake Keystone stub would listen on 127.0.0.1 only. This would be similar to other projects which allow noauth in local mode as well. Other End User Impact --------------------- * We would again have a single template language driving our Undercloud and Overcloud tooling. Heat templates are very well documented. Performance Impact ------------------ * Initial testing shows the single process Heat API/Engine is quite light taking only 70MB of RAM on a machine. * The approach is likely to be on-par with the performance of instack-undercloud. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- * The format of undercloud.conf may change. Alternately we could add a 'compat' layer which takes the format of 'undercloud.conf' today and sets Heat parameters and or includes heat environments to give feature parity and an upgrade path for existing users. Developer Impact ---------------- * Developers would be able to do less work to maintain the UnderCloud by sharing composable services. * Future work around composable upgrades could also be utilized and shared across the Undercloud and Overcloud. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- dprince (dan-prince on LP) Work Items ---------- * Create heat-all launcher. * Create python-tripleoclient command to run 'undercloud deploy'. * Create undercloud.yaml Heat templates. Dependencies ============ * Heat all launcher and noauth middleware. Testing ======= Swapping in the new Undercloud as part of CI should allow us to fully test it. Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation changes will need to be made that explains new config interfaces (Heat parameters and environments). We could minimiz doc changes by developing a 'compat' interface to process the legacy undercloud.conf and perhaps even re-use the 'undercloud install' task in python-tripleoclient as well so it essentially acts the same on the CLI.

PKI and PKIZ tokens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PKI tokens are signed documents that contain the authentication context, as well as the service catalog. Depending on the size of the OpenStack deployment, these tokens can be very long. The Identity service uses public/private key pairs and certificates in order to create and validate PKI tokens. The same concepts from PKI tokens apply to PKIZ tokens. The only difference between the two is PKIZ tokens are compressed to help mitigate the size issues of PKI. For more information on the certificate setup for PKI and PKIZ tokens, see the :doc:`identity-certificates-for-pki`.",1,14

The port security is configurable and can be
disabled if the user asks for it. That means
no security rules should be created for that
port. At the moment, even if the port security
is disabled, the default security rules are
still created and denies all VM traffic.

This patch fixes this issue by skipping
security rules creation if the port does
not have security enabled.

The current workflow did not end up copying the validation keys to the
overcloud nodes, because the overcloud deployment action is
asynchronous. So copy_ssh_keys runs right after the Heat call when the
list of Nova servers is empty.

So instead, we optionally pass the validation key into Heat directly
at deployment time, not after.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================================== Neutron Interaction Refresh (Ocata) ==================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/neutron-interaction-refresh-ocata We need to be able to easily maintain and evolve the neutron and nova interaction code. It has evolved into a slightly confused state, and we started to untangle some of that as part of prep-for-network-aware-scheduling. There are also several longstanding bugs that are proving hard to fix without deep thought around how Nova and Neutron interact. With the imminent deprecation of nova-network, we can look at how the Network API can move to be neutron centric, rather than nova-network centric. This spec is laying out the path to take back control of the Nova and Neutron interactions, and finally address some of the fundamental bugs we are hitting. Problem description =================== At the same time there are some long standing bugs such as handling port quotas correctly, races when the same port is passed to multiple boot requests and minimizing the downtime during live-migration operations. TODO... Use Cases --------- These use cases look at the key operations Nova is trying to do when talking to Neutron. These are not end user use cases, but please bear with me. * Checking the users requested network configuration is valid * Creating ports on behalf of the user * Updating ports to include the requested configuration for the current instance, such as security groups. * Correctly binding the port the appropriate host and instance. * OS-VIF helps correctly setup the VIF * Waiting for the correct moment to start the VM, after the networking is fully setup by neutron * Being able to move instances between hosts, via migration or live-migration, with minimal network downtime * When terminating and instance, correctly cleaning up the configuration. Proposed change =============== TODO Alternatives ------------ We have spoken about a ""fast path"" between Nova and the Neutron Agent that both run on the same host. Currently we have a call back What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one. Data model impact ----------------- TODO Cover: Network info, network request, VIF object. REST API impact --------------- None. While this may depend on additional Neutron APIs, this should not change the intent of the existing Nova API. Security impact --------------- Understanding the code should help us keep this secure. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ Hopefully this will speed up our interactions with Neutron. TODO - more detailed discussion Other deployer impact --------------------- To get the main benefits of this work, you will need to upgrade Neutron. Developer impact ---------------- It should be easier to evolve the Nova/Neutron interactions going forward. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: John Garbutt (johnthetubaguy) Other contributors: Likely to get help other OSIC people. Work Items ---------- TODO Dependencies ============ TODO * Adding migrating_to the binding profile: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/275073/ * portbinding_information_for_nova Neutron spec: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/309416/ Testing ======= This should be covered by the existing gate tests. TODO - better functional testing suite? Documentation Impact ==================== Will need to update the developer docs on the intent and details of the Nova and Neutron interactions.

It used to be that a FloatingIP would depend on all RouterInterfaces that
it couldn't determine were on a different subnet to the port the FloatingIP
was attaching to (by virtue of the Subnet value being None in both cases,
and therefore matching). That changed in
c9f32bfef08e567fda6848686ff6281fa3344c69 to depending only on
RouterInterfaces that it *could* determine *were* in the same subnet. This
resulted in no dependency being added at create time when the Subnet was a
resource in the local stack (as opposed to being passed in e.g. as a
parameter).

That caused problems with some Neutron plugins, but worked with others
where the dependencies were required only at delete time (at this point the
in-template Subnets had IDs and therefore the dependencies were fully
determined). However, with convergence phase 1 enabled, the dependencies
calculated at create time are used throughout the lifecycle of the stack,
thus causing non-deterministic ordering problems at delete time.

This patch restores the behaviour where if the Subnet for a RouterInterface
cannot be determined, the FloatingIP will depend on it. It also corrects a
bug where we only checked the first Subnet if multiple Networks/Subnets
were listed for the port.

Commit a9f50dd3823ea2e9c568a1fdd970e268955dca9f in os-brick 1.7.0
introduced the usage of safe_decode() of the results of CLI commands.
This revealed that two unit tests in Cinder use a mocked ""execute""
method of os-brick *without* specifying the return value. This lead
to an exception in the safe_decode() method as it isn't able to
decode MagicMocks:
    TypeError: <class 'mock.mock.MagicMock'> can't be decoded

This change adds return values to the mocked ""execute"" method which
can be decoded safely.

This change can not be cherry picked from the newton and ocata fixes
(dc84c1de76e51487c8b7a72ba623c12ee2747879) due to refactoring of the
test_volume unit test files.

incessant warning logging when switching Projects while being on the

Retrieving domain information is a Keystone admin URL operation. As a
pre-check, such operations would be Forbidden if the logon user does not
have an 'admin' role on the current project.

Since this is a common occurence, and can cause incessant warning
logging in the horizon logs, we recognize this condition and return the

This patch fixes two bugs.
1.Currently when image driver is glance driver
  container creation is failing due to bug in
  image driver code, this patch fixes that.
2.Currently during image pulling in docker image
  driver , if image is not found it silently ignores
  that, and container creation fails in create stage
  due to image not found error, while it should fail
  during image pull.

This guide assumes a multi-node environment. If seeking for an all-in-one or trial setup, probably devstack is the better choice. Please refer to devstack documentation in that case. Version Match ------------- Networking-odl version needs to be on par with the neutron version being used. Deployment ---------- Describe the exact steps to do a multi-node deployment. Topology ~~~~~~~~ Describe the network topology of the multi-node environment. Control Node ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Neutron + networking-odl installation and configuration. OpenDaylight installation and configuration is out of scope. Compute Node ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Compute node specific setup.

It used to be that a FloatingIP would depend on all RouterInterfaces that
it couldn't determine were on a different subnet to the port the FloatingIP
was attaching to (by virtue of the Subnet value being None in both cases,
and therefore matching). That changed in
c9f32bfef08e567fda6848686ff6281fa3344c69 to depending only on
RouterInterfaces that it *could* determine *were* in the same subnet. This
resulted in no dependency being added at create time when the Subnet was a
resource in the local stack (as opposed to being passed in e.g. as a
parameter).

That caused problems with some Neutron plugins, but worked with others
where the dependencies were required only at delete time (at this point the
in-template Subnets had IDs and therefore the dependencies were fully
determined). However, with convergence phase 1 enabled, the dependencies
calculated at create time are used throughout the lifecycle of the stack,
thus causing non-deterministic ordering problems at delete time.

This patch restores the behaviour where if the Subnet for a RouterInterface
cannot be determined, the FloatingIP will depend on it. It also corrects a
bug where we only checked the first Subnet if multiple Networks/Subnets
were listed for the port.

Currently, it's not possible to create duplicated tags for particular owner.
For, example you can not create tag with name 'test' for release. But, list of
tags available for specific cluster contains tag's provided by its release and
tags provided by its enabled plugins. So, it's possible to create so-called
tag for cluster and its release.
I introduced definition 'namespace' to avoid described cases. It's spaces
where all tags should have unique names.
I differentiate three kinds of tags namespaces:

Commit a9f50dd3823ea2e9c568a1fdd970e268955dca9f in os-brick 1.7.0
introduced the usage of safe_decode() of the results of CLI commands.
This revealed that two unit tests in Cinder use a mocked ""execute""
method of os-brick *without* specifying the return value. This lead
to an exception in the safe_decode() method as it isn't able to
decode MagicMocks:
    TypeError: <class 'mock.mock.MagicMock'> can't be decoded

This change adds return values to the mocked ""execute"" method which
can be decoded safely.

The unit test that is getting fixed fails with error:

AttributeError: None does not have the attribute 'info'

It happens because _LOG.info is being patched at the moment when _LOG
is None. For a reason, this doesn't happen always. For example,
the problem was gone after a recheck in
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/391130/.

Patch log only after app creation. This seems to be a common pattern
across all other tests involving mock, for example, in
test_conf_middleware_log_and_default_as_messaging.

[#] http://cassandra.apache.org/ The performance is amazing and generally dominates others according to universities' research reports [#]_. .. [#] http://www.planetcassandra.org/nosql-performance-benchmarks/ Besides performance, it also has many noticeable advantages such as #. Fault-tolerant: Data is automatically replicated to multiple nodes for fault-tolerance. Replication across multiple data centers is supported. Failed nodes can be replaced with no downtime. #. Decentralized: There are no single points of failure. There are no network bottlenecks. Every node in the cluster is identical. #. Horizontally Scalable: Read and write throughput both increase linearly as new machines are added, with no downtime or interruption to applications. #. Durable: It is suitable for applications that can't afford to lose data, even when an entire data center goes down. #. In Control: Choose between synchronous or asynchronous replication for each update. Highly available asynchronous operations are optimized with features like Hinted Handoff and Read Repair. #. Easy to Maintain: The control plane of the whole geographically-distributed data cluster is fully implemented without support of external applications. It also provides an operation portal for daily maintainance. Currenly, we implements control plane of clustering for Redis inside dragonflow, which is actually beyond the scope of dragonflow project. The reason why we implement db-api layer is that we do not want to maintain the details of data backend as it is not the responsibility of dragonflow project. The disadvantage of Cassandra is that it needs external mechanism for PUB/SUB, for example, Zookeeper or ZeroMQ. The latter has been implemented in dragonflow, so it is usable for now. It is noted that Cassandra is run over JVM. Highlights ---------- In this section I will highlight some internal mechanisms of Cassandra that will greatly help dragonflow scale out and put into production. #. You can adjust ReplicationFactor to have multiple replications across data centers. #. You can adjust ConsistencyLevel to use different algorithms, like Quorum. #. Every node in the cluster is identical. No Master or Slave roles. #. The data written to Cassandra node is going to append-only CommitLog first and fsync to disk next.

Commit a9f50dd3823ea2e9c568a1fdd970e268955dca9f in os-brick 1.7.0
introduced the usage of safe_decode() of the results of CLI commands.
This revealed that two unit tests in Cinder use a mocked ""execute""
method of os-brick *without* specifying the return value. This lead
to an exception in the safe_decode() method as it isn't able to
decode MagicMocks:
    TypeError: <class 'mock.mock.MagicMock'> can't be decoded

This change adds return values to the mocked ""execute"" method which
can be decoded safely.

This change can not be cherry picked from the newton and ocata fixes
(dc84c1de76e51487c8b7a72ba623c12ee2747879) due to refactoring of the
test_volume unit test files.

Also, this power off request can lock nodes for substantial time, causing

This was missed in the recent password refactor.

Also:
* Clean up variable names to help distinguish between the previously
  globally defined 'clients' and sometimes locally overriden 'clients'
  variables.
* Update references to obsolete pre-refactor password names, used when
  creating overcloud endpoints outside of puppet.

1. Now the reason and traceback can be shown together in the report.
   There are some cases when it is needed. For example, when we have
   ""xfail"" test with a description about the failure. In this case the
   report should show both the failure description and the traceback.

2. Some spelling mistakes were fixed.

3. The 'skipped' and 'expected failures' columns were swapped for more
   readability.

4. The 'toggle header' and 'toggle tags' buttons were renamed to
   'Toggle Header' and 'Toggle Tags' correspondingly. Also, these
   buttons were swapped to provide a better user interface to users.

5. The 'go top' button was renamed to 'Go Up'.

1. What is the problem?
In order to dispatch resource operation request to the proper bottom instance,
we need a resource routing table, which maps a resource to the bottom instance
which it’s located at. However, the resource routing APIs have not been
implemented, so this patch carries out these features and performs some tests
for them at the same time.

2. What is the solution to the problem?
To implement the resource routing features, a new file named routing.py is
created in the directory tricircle/api/controllers, then regular post and
get functions will be implemented there. As for the unit test, a file named
test_routing.py is added to the directory tricircle/tests/unit/api/controllers,
conducting relevant tests for the features in file routing.py.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle to realize
the solution?
Some main features like post, update, get and delete functions are implemented
in the file routing.py, then relative test method for each of them is realized
in the file test_routing.py. At last, these features are added to the search path
in the file root.py for REST API call.

Layer 7 switching is also known as ""request switching,"" ""application switching,"" and ""content based routing."" A layer 7 switch presents itself to the outside world a ""virtual server"" that accepts requests on behalf of a number of servers. It distributes those requests based on **policies**, which use application data to determine which server (or set of servers) should service any given request. This implementation lets the application infrastructure be optimized specifically to serve specific types of content. For example, one server can be tuned to serve only images, another for execution of server-side scripting languages like PHP and ASP, and another for static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Unlike lower-level load balancing, layer 7 switching does not require that all servers in the pool (farm/cluster) have the same content. In fact, it is generally accepted that a load balancer configuration using layer 7 switching expects that the back-end servers from different pools will have different content. Layer 7 switches are capable of directing requests based on URI, host, HTTP headers, and anything in the application message. ## L7 switching in Neutron LBaaS The layer 7 switching capabilities described in this document were added to Neutron LBaaS for the Mitaka release. Note also that layer 7 switching applies to the LBaaS v2 API only. It's also worth noting that while layer 7 switching can in theory be done for any well-defined layer 7 application interface, for the purposes of Neutron LBaaS, the L7 switching functionality refers only to the HTTP protocol and its semantics. Initially, it is anticipated that not all load balancer vendors with Neutron LBaaS drivers will support L7 switching. However, the L7 switching functionality described in this document should be universal enough that all load balancer vendors—capable of doing L7 functionality at all—should be able to write drivers to work with Neutron LBaaS L7 switching. ## API and logic changes * Pools can be created without necessarily being associated with a Listener * Pools are associated directly with exactly one load balancer. * Pools have a ""loose coupling"" with Listeners (that is, a pool can be associated effectively with zero or one listeners through L7policies, or through default_pool assignments.) * CRUD operations for L7Policy * CRUD operations for L7Rule ## CLI Example ``` neutron lbaas-create-listener listener1 ..... ( Create listener) neutron lbaas-create-pool pool1 ..... ( Create pool) neutron --policy policy1 lbaas-create-l7policy --name ""policy1"" --description ""My Description"" --listener ""listener1"" --action redirect_to_pool --pool ""pool1"" --position 1 ``` (Create l7 policy named 'policy1' and insert it at the beginning of the the l7 policy list for 'listener1', with the action of this policy to redirect to pool 'pool1' ) ``` neutron lbaas-create-l7rule rule1 --rule-type path --compare-type starts_with --value ""/api"" --policy policy ``` (Create l7 rule named 'rule1' and associate it with the policy 'policy1' ) ``` neutron lbaas-create-l7rule rule2 --rule-type header --compare-type equal_to --key ""mycookie"" --value ""myvalue"" --invert --policy policy1 (Create l7 rule named 'rule2' and associate it with the policy 'policy1' ) The foregoing L7 policy and rule creation code should now enable this logic: In listener1's configuration, redirect any given request to pool1 IF: The request URI path starts with ""/api"" AND cookie ""mycookie"" is NOT equal to ""myvalue"" ``` ## L7 Rules An L7 Rule is a single, simple logical test which returns either true or false. It consists of a rule type, a comparison type, a value, and an optional key that gets used depending on the rule type. An L7 rule must always be associated with an L7 policy. ### Rule types L7 rules have these types: * **hostname**: The rule does a comparison between the HTTP/1.1 hostname in the request against the value parameter in the rule. * **path**: The rule compares the path portion of the HTTP URI against the value parameter in the rule. * **file_type**: The rule compares the last portion of the URI against the value parameter in the rule. (eg. ""txt"", ""jpg"", etc.) * **header**: The rule looks for a header defined in the key parameter and compares it against the value parameter in the rule. * **cookie**: The rule looks for a cookie named by the key parameter and compares it against the value parameter in the rule. ### Comparison types L7 rules of a given type always do comparisons. Notice that not all rule types support all comparison types. Supported comparisons include: * **regex**: Perl type regular expression matching * **starts_with**: String start with * **ends_with**: String ends with * **contains**: String contains * **equal_to**: String equals ### Invert To express the logic required by some policies more fully , rules may have their result inverted. That is to say, if the invert parameter of a given rule is true, the result of its comparison will be inverted. (For example, an inverted ""equal to"" rule effectively becomes a ""not equal to"", and an inverted ""regex"" rule returns true only if the given regex does *not* match.) ## L7 Policies An L7 Policy is a collection of L7 rules associated with a Listener, and which also may have an association to a back-end pool. Policies describe actions that should be taken by the load balancing software if all of the rules in the policy return true / match. ### Policy Logic Policy logic is very simple: All the rules associated with a given policy are logically ANDed together. A request much match all the policy's rules to match the policy. If you need to express a logical OR operation between rules, then do this by creating multiple policies with the same action (or, possibly, by making a more elaborate regular expression). ### Policy Actions If an L7 policy matches a given request, that policy's action is executed. These are the actions a L7 Policy may take: * **block**: The request is denied with an appropriate response code, and not forwarded on to any back-end pool. * **redirect_to_url**: The request is sent an HTTP redirect to the URL defined in the redirect_url parameter. * **redirect_to_pool**: The request is forwarded to the back-end pool associated with the L7 policy (which is usually not the default pool associated with the listener). ### Policy Position Notes regarding policy position: * L7 Policies are evaluated in a specific order (as defined by the 'position' attribute), and the first policy that matches a given request will be the one whose action is followed. * If no policy matches a given request, that request is routed to the listener's default pool (if it exists). * Policy position numbering starts with 1. * If a new policy is created with a position that matches that of an existing policy, then the new policy is inserted at the given position. * If a new policy is created without specifying a position, or specifying a position that is greater than the number of policies already in the list, the new policy will just be appended to the list. * When policies are inserted, deleted, or appended to the list, the policy position values are re-ordered from 1 without skipping numbers. For example, if policy A, B, and C have position values of 1, 2 and 3, respectively, when you delete policy B from the list, policy C's position becomes 2. **Important note**: At the present time, the reference implementation for LBaaSv2 uses` haproxy`, and `haproxy` enforces the following ordering regarding policy actions: * `block` policies take precedence over all other policies. * `redirect_to_url` policies take precedence over `redirect_to_pool` policies. * `redirect_to_pool `policies are only evaluated after all of the above, and in the order specified by the 'position' of the policy. (It turns out that nearly all practical uses for 'block' and 'redirect_to_url' policies actually need these to happen before 'redirect_to_pool' policies anyway, so we don't expect the above impositions on policy evaluation order to cause problems for almost all users of the technology.) ### Useful links * https://github.com/openstack/neutron-specs/blob/master/specs/mitaka/lbaas-l7-rules.rst * http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.6.html#7 ",,130,1

Modified a ""List Environments"" API call to add an ability to filter
environments by an owner project (tenant).
The request now supports extra query parameter - tenant. If this
parameter is passed the list of returned environments is filtered to
return only the environments owned by the tenant with this id.
This operation requires a 'list_environments_all_tenants' policy to be
enabled for a caller user (by default it means that the user has to
have an ""admin"" role).

There are two distinct DNS resolution problems. One, the nodename
reverse DNS resolution. And two, resolution of peers. This attempts
to fix both problems.

Nodename is only required when rabbitmq runs multiple instances on
the same host. Having this set complicates the DNS requirements.
Removing this setting may simplify the DNS problems this charm has
faced.

For peer resolution force the use of hostname rather than dynamically
attempting to resolve one from an IP. Set /etc/hosts with the local
hostname and with each peer.

Standardize the way an IPv4 or IPv6 address is selected throughout
the charm. Standardize the way a hostname is selected throughout the
charm.

Also lack of clarity about how certain driver operations should work or which operations are required has led to driver that work incorrectly despite good testing work by the original author. Scenario tests should provide a way for driver authors to run a ""conformance test"" to validate that their drivers do indeed meet community standards. To address these two issues we plan to implement new scenario tests to address coverage gaps and also to request that 3rd party CI systems start running the scenario tests suite in addition to the functional test suite.

Keystone's preformance degradates as the 'revocation_event' table grows
in size. This patch is the initial step towards reducing the number of
revocation events written the 'revocation_event' table. Instead of
creating revocation events when a project or domain is disabled,
keystone will explicitly do an enabled check to determine if a token is
valid. Futhermore, this is just one step in a series of patches to
eliminate most revocation events, ultimately improving the performance
of Fernet token validation.

arrangement.

It also:
 * Removes the explicit cinderv2 endpoint override as kolla now is
   patched
 * Uses zuul-cloner for faster git access.
 * Turns off keystone caching to make the gate reliable. Keystone
   caching is racy.

* Clean up variable names to help distinguish between the previously

* Update references to obsolete pre-refactor password names, used when

In python 3, range() does what xrange() used to do and xrange() does not
exist. If you want to write code that will run on both Python 2 and
Python 3, you can't use xrange().

range() can actually be faster in some cases - eg. if iterating over the
same sequence multiple times. xrange() has to reconstruct the integer
object every time, but range() will have real integer objects.
(It will always perform worse in terms of memory however)

xrange() isn't usable in all cases where a real list is needed.
For instance, it doesn't support slices, or any list methods.

The intentional use of ""bare except"" handling in catch_errors and some
daemons to prevent propagation on unexpected errors that do not
inherit from Exception (like eventlet.Timeout) or even BaseException
(like old-style classes) has the side effect of spuriously ""handling""
*expected* errors like when a signal handler raises SystemExit.

The signal handler installed in our Daemon is intended to ensure first
that the entire process group and any forked processes (like rsync's)
receive the SIGTERM signal and also that the process itself
terminates.

The use of sys.exit was not a concious grandiose plans for graceful
shutdown (like the running[0] = False trick that wsgi server parent
process do) - the desired behavior for SIGTERM is to stop - hard.

This change ensures the original goals and intentions of our signal
handler are fulfilled without the undesirable side effect that can
cause our daemons to confusingly log an expected message to stop as an
unexpected error, and start ignoring additional SIGTERM messages;
forcing our kind operators to resort to brutal process murder.
