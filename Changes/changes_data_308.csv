There is a unique index on the compute_nodes.uuid column which
means we can't have more than one compute_nodes record in the
same DB with the same UUID even if one is soft deleted because
the deleted column is not part of that unique index constraint.

This is a problem with ironic nodes where the node is 1:1 with
the compute node record, and when a node is undergoing maintenance
the driver doesn't return it from get_available_nodes() so the
ComputeManager.update_available_resource periodic task (soft)
deletes the compute node record, but when the node is no longer
under maintenance in ironic and the driver reports it, the
ResourceTracker._init_compute_node code will fail to create the
ComputeNode record again because of the duplicate uuid.

This change handles the DBDuplicateEntry error in compute_node_create
by finding the soft-deleted compute node with the same uuid and
simply updating it to no longer be (soft) deleted.

Currently, QoS is implemented by TC command of HV OS.
This solution has many drawbacks, such as not supported
VLAN network or VMs from same HV.

Meter is a comfortable solution, because it is implemented
in OpenFlow, so it is flexible and exact.

This adds publishing of artifacts to AFS in parallel with the existing

The additional tasks added to the openstack-artifacts.yaml playbook
have been tested in the project-config-test-artifacts-to-afs test
(results at [1]) and also in an external project

After this merges, I will manually rsync the old static tarballs data

At that point we can switch the DNS entries for
static.<openstack|opendev>.org (the sites have been created with [3])

In the interest of keeping CI happy, and reducing the need for
wasteful rechecks, I've changed a test which was increasingly
seeing unit test failures on py37 and py38 testing.

This test functionally still does what is required, validates only
one thread would be utilized by default, but doesn't do output
validation since the calls, threading, and mock interaction were
leading to test failures.

The python2-based jobs from integrated-gate are failing now since
Neutron requires py>=3.6. So drop that template from the devstack-gate
project.

The alternative would be to run those jobs against a stable branch
instead master, but that would be non-trivial since devstack-gate is
branchless.

Also the expected remaining lifetime of ds-gate is limited, since it is
a current community goal to convert all legacy jobs to new versions,
which will obsolete the devstack-gate code. With that argument I also
refrain from moving the whole job setup into the project itself, as we
would do with any project that still has a future.

Octavia has a diskimage-builder element to install the amphora-agent.
When creating an amphora image from an Octavia stable branch, the
expectation is the amphora-agent code will match the same branch (master
or stable). However, the amphora-agent always pulls master versions of
upper-constraints.txt and of the Octavia Git repository.

This patch updates the branch name and upper constraints for the
amphora-agent in Octavia on stable branch creation.

When Load Balancer and its member has FIP assigned
and environment is configured to use DVR the member
FIP needs to be centralized. It is current core OVN
limitation, that should be solved in [1].

This patch adds this mechanism to OVN Client and
OVN Octavia provider driver.

It covers cases:

1) FIP association on port that is a member of
   some LB - make it centralized.
2) FIP association on LB VIP - find a members
   FIPs and centralized them.
3) Add a member to LB that has FIP already
   configured - checks if a member has FIP
   and centralize it.
4) The reverse of each of the above cases.

In addition I needed to extend OVN LB member external_id
entry to add an information about member subnet_id
in order to easly track member port from mechanism OVN
driver.
That means I needed also to support both old and new
conventions. This patch adds also this code.

Old convention:
member_`member_id`_`ip_address`:`port`

New convention:
member_`member_id`_`ip_address`:`port`_`subnet_id`

This patch delegates tasks setting up a keystone identity provider to the
keystone_service_setup_host becasue the ansible modules used require the
python-keystoneclient module. These tasks will fail when the keystone
(container) host is not the deploy host as python-keystoneclient will
be missing.

These tasks have recently been refactored in a previous patch [1] to use
the os_* ansible modules instead of the OSA specific keystone module.
This patch fixes a reported bug with the old code which is also present
after that refactoring.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================================== NUMA Topology with Resource Providers ===================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/numa-topology-with-rps Now that `Nested Resource Providers`_ is a thing in both Placement API and Nova compute nodes, we could use the Resource Providers tree for explaining the relationship in between a root Resource Provider (root RP) ie. a compute, and one or more Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes (aka. cells), each of them having separate resources, like memory or PCI devices, even if any core can access those resources. Problem description =================== The NUMATopologyFilter checks a lot of NUMA related resources like emulator threads policies, CPU pinned instances or memory page sizes. While we would like to keep that filter, the problem is that the NUMA topology is directly verified by a ``nova.virt.hardware._numa_fit_instance_cell()`` method. Instead, we could use the Placement API for knowing the NUMA topology, and just directly allocating a specific instance to a NUMA node if possible. How a specific pCPU within the NUMA node would be pinned for a vGPU would still be done out of the Placement API. Use Cases --------- #1 : As a user, I'd like to get fast access to memory for my 2-core instance ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Consider the following NUMA topology for a 2-sockets, 4 cores with no Hyper-Threading: .. code:: +--------------------------------------+ | CN1 | +-+---------------+--+---------------+-+ | NUMA1 | | NUMA2 | +-+----+-+----+-+ +-+----+-+----+-+ |CPU1| |CPU2| |CPU3| |CPU4| +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ Here, CPU1 and CPU2 would share the same memory thru a common bus, but not CPU3 and CPU4 that would be on a second bus. Ideally, intensive applications that would require more than one core would try to make sure that both cores are allocated on the same NUMA node, or some performance penalties would occur. Of course, for the moment, if you're an operator, you can provide a flavor for asking that by using an extra spec like: .. code:: $ openstack flavor set FLAVOR-NAME \ --property hw:numa_nodes=FLAVOR-NODES \ --property hw:numa_cpus.N=FLAVOR-CORES \ --property hw:numa_mem.N=FLAVOR-MEMORY See all the `NUMA possible extra specs`_ for a flavor. Now, imagine a world where instead of having that extra spec only for libvirt, you could use a Placement extra spec... #2 : As a user, I'd like to get my vGPUs as close as possible from the vCPUs ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Say now that the above NUMA topology with a 2-sockets, 4 cores no HT is having some PCI devices, like a NVidia Tesla M10 device. That PCI device will then be using a specific bus related to a NUMA node, like : +---------------------------------------------+ | CN1 | +-+----------------------+--+---------------+-+ | NUMA1 | | NUMA2 | +-+----+-+------+----+-+ +-+----+-+----+-+ |CPU1| |CPU2| |PGPU| |CPU3| |CPU4| +----+ +----- +----+ +----+ +----+ Here, the physical GPU device (PGPU) would share a common bus with CPU1 and CPU2, but not with CPU3 and CPU3. In that case, imagine I'd like to run a CUDA library like OpenACC for computing things like Artificial Intelligence calculations, or coin mining (heh), I'd love to make sure my GPU devices are affinitized by NUMA nodes for maximum throughput reasons. Proposed change =============== NUMA nodes being nested Resource Providers ------------------------------------------ Given virt drivers can pass a resource providers tree to the compute service, for example the libvirt driver could create a tree for a (2-socket, 16 nodes) NUMA topology having one GPU device and one SRIOV PF like this: +-----------------+ | compute_node_rp | | VCPU: 16 | | MEMORY_MB: 8192 | | NUMA_SOCKET: 2 | +-----------------+ / \ +----------------------+ +----------------------+ | NUMA1_rp | | NUMA2_rp | | NUMA_CORE: 8 | | NUMA_CORE: 8 | | NUMA_MEMORY_MB: 4096 | | NUMA_MEMORY_MB: 4096 | +----------------------+ +----------------------+ | | +----------+ +-----------------+ | PGPU1_rp | | PF_rp | | VGPU: 8 | | SRIOV_NET_VF: 8 | +----------+ +-----------------+ Each NUMA node would be then a child Resource Provider, having two resource classes : * NUMA_CORE: for telling how many cores the NUMA node has (threaded or not). * NUMA_MEMORY_MB: for telling how much memory the NUMA node has. The root Resource Provider (ie. the compute node) would then provide the same existing resources than if it wouldn't have a NUMA topology (for VCPU and MEMORY_MB resource classes), *but* would also add a specific resource class called `NUMA_SOCKET` that would help to know how many NUMA nodes is having the compute node (and whether it's a NUMA architecture). Note that the ``NUMA_SOCKET`` resource class won't have allocations against it, but will just be used for telling how many NUMA nodes the instance should use. Each PCI device (like a physical GPU device) would then be a nested child where each one would have specific resource classes. For example: * GPU devices are having a specific VGPU resource class that counts the number of virtual GPUs it can create. * NIC with SRIOV phyical function could count the number of virtual functions it can create. Asking for NUMA resources tied to a NUMA node or not ---------------------------------------------------- Back to the usecase #1, it would then be possible to ask for specific NUMA resources like this: * if I want ``NB_NUMA`` specific NUMA nodes for ``NB_CPUS`` VCPUs, then the flavor extraspec could be ``NUMA_SOCKETS=NB_NUMA`` for a ``NB_CPUS`` flavor. There wouldn't be any guarantee that you would end up with all your vCPUs spread into NB_NUMA nodes, but just an affinity try. Again, ``NUMA_SOCKET`` resource class wouldn't have allocations against it. But it could be also possible to ask for specific NUMA resources for one node by telling this: ``resources:NUMA_CORES=2&NUMA_MEMORY_MB=1024``. In that case, it would make sure that all the resources are tied to a specific NUMA node. In case all the NUMA nodes wouldn't have enough resources, then a NoValidHost exception should be raised. .. note:: It's the operator's responsibility to make flavors consistent between respectively VCPU and NUMA_CORES resource classes and MEMORY_MB and NUMA_MEMORY_MB resource classes, so that allocations would be consistent for both resource classes: * where VCPU and MEMORY_MB would be done against the root RP * and NUMA_CORES and NUMA_MEMORY_MB would be against a child NUMA RP If the operator would like to provide a flavor for asking resources for more than just one NUMA node, then the usecase would be related to the `Granular Resource Request`_ spec and shouldn't be discussed in this spec. Asking for NUMA-associated devices ---------------------------------- The same logic could be done for associated devices that are children of NUMA nodes: * If I just want to provide NB_GPU vGPUs for an instance, I would just amend a flavor and ask for ``resources:VGPU=NB_GPU``. No NUMA relationship would be verified, exactly like the current behaviour. * If I want NB_GPU vGPUs *and* if possible tied to a specific NUMA node, then I'd propose ``resources:VGPU=NB_GPU&NUMA_SOCKET=1``. If the Placement API can't satisfy the fact that the vCPUs and the vGPUs wouldn't be in the same NUMA node, that shouldn't be blocking. * If I want NB_GPU vGPUs *and* those vGPUs be in the exact same NUMA node than my vCPUs, then I'd amend my flavor by ``resouces:VGPU=NB_GPU&NUMA_CORES=NB_CPU`` (where NB_CPU would be the same value than my flavor vCPU number) Alternatives ------------ Modeling of NUMA resources could be done by sharding MEMORY_MB and VCPU resources across all NUMA nodes. In that case, some specific examples of instances spreading multiple NUMA nodes (or not caring at all about NUMA topologies) could be impacted. NUMA_SOCKETS resource class is maybe useless. I tried to consider some approach of a soft-check (non blocking) verification by the Placement API. Please chime in that spec if you consider a better approach for the affinity usecase. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- Operators will need to understand how `Asking for NUMA resources tied to a NUMA node or not`_ in order to create flavors exploiting the new functionality. See `Documentation Impact`_. There is no impact on the nova or openstack CLIs. The existing CLI syntax is adequate for expressing the newly-supported extra_specs keys.

Paunch does docker/podman rm -f, when removes containers. It seems it
returns too early, having some leftovers (like docker service
endpoints) behind or pending for it to be removed later, in case of
big fat deamons.

Long story short, don't do rm -f and allow it to do its job gracefully

This patch reflects recent changes in neutron CI jobs configuration
by adding to the dashboard new jobs:
* neutron-von-tempest-ovs-release
* neutron-von-tempest-ovs-release-ipv6-only (non-voting)
* openstack-tox-py38 (non-voting)o

removing from the dashboard jobs:
* test-release-openstack
* networking-midonet-tempest-aio-ml2-centos-7 (non-voting)
* neutron-centos-7-tripleo-standalone (non-voting)

This patch also renames ""Scenario jobs failure rates"" to be
""Neutron tempest plugin failure rates"" graph and moves
neutron-tempest-plugin-api job from the
""Integrated tempest failure rates"" graph to this new one.

This is a combination of 3 fixes, which are all needed to fix the gate.

1. Adjust version constraint of hacking

Neutron constrained the version of hacking < 1.2.0, but since then the
unit tests fails with:

ERROR: Double requirement given: hacking<1.2.0,>=1.1.0 (from -ri https://opendev.org/openstack/neutron/raw/branch/master/test-requirements.txt (line 4)) (already in hacking>=1.1.0 (from -r [..]networking-powervm/test-requirements.txt (line 4)), name='hacking')

So let's simply use the same constraint as set in neutron.

2. Add bindep.txt

...to fix building lxml

(cherry picked from commit ed11ef916d415ea060ca92afa0521f863714ffec)

3. Update sphinx version constraints

Since we touch requirements file with this patch the requirements-check
job also runs and does not find the matching python2 and python3 sphinx
requirements, so update that.

NOTE(elod.illes): libz-dev binary dependency also needed otherwise
lower-constraints target fails.

Problem description =================== Recently in Rocky, Glance has added multiple backend as a EXPERIMENTAL feature. This way opearator can configure more than one of similar or different kind of backends and use one as a default backend. If backend is not specified at the time of uploading the image then the image will be stored in default backend. In case of nova snapshot if multiple backend is configured then the snapshot image will be uploaded to default backend. This will not cause any issue unless nova is using ceph backend and glance has ceph backend as well but default backend is not ceph. This will affect nova's ability to use ceph backend for uploading snapshots in more efficient way. Use Cases --------- Operator wants to upload all the snapshots to one specific/dedicated backend. Fast snapshot using ceph backend even ceph is not a default backend in glance. Proposed change =============== Add a new microversion to snapshot API to support configuring to upload the snapshot image to specific backend. I am proposing to add new --backend option to snapshot API where user can specify to which backend snapshot image will be uploaded. If --backend option is not specified then the image will be uploaded to default backend. Alternatives ------------ Add a new configuration option 'glance_backend' under 'glance' section to upload all the snapshot images to specified/dedicated backend. If this option is not present then all the snapshot images will be uploaded to default backend. This solution will be efficient if operator doesn't want to expose the use of uploading snapshot image to specific backend to end user. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- * URL: * /v2.1/servers/{server_id}/action: * Request method: * POST The config of backend to add undeer metadata to request payload :: { ""createImage"": { ""metadata"": {""backend"": ""backend""}, ""name"": ""test-snapshot"" } } Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- User will be able to upload snapshot image to dedicated/specified backend. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: abhishek-kekane Work Items ---------- * Add ``backned`` support in snapshot API * Add ``backend`` support for 'nova image-create' in novaclient * Add related tests Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= * Add related unittest * Add related functional test * Add tempest tests Documentation Impact ==================== Add docs that mention how to use multiple backend of glance after the microversion.

This it is a problem for both ``DHSS=True`` and ``DHSS=False`` modes. It makes the user able to deplete the storage resources and have troubles depending on the configured backend. :solution: We should handle with this issue in a way where the administrator is able to specify the max number of replicas that a given share is able to have according to the backend capacity. The proposed solution is to add a new extra spec to the share types called ``max_replica_per_share``, then, when creating a share\ replica, Manila will check the value of ``max_replica_per_share`` of the parent share's share type and also will check if the number of existent replicas is not bigger than or equal to the max replica value. A database migration will be created in order to update all the existent share types, adding them the new extra spec. In the database update, a default of 2 replicas will be set due to some backends capability. All administrators will need to update the share type according to their backend capacity, and will set the extra spec according to the number of replicas that shares created under the given share type are able to have. When creating a new share type, if the user does not specify the new extra spec, the service will automatically set this value to 2 and in case the administrators needs to change the value, they will need to update the extra spec. :impacts: DocImpact, APIImpact :timeline: Include in Ussusri release. :link: https://review.opendev.org/#/c/696136/ :assignee: carloss ",,35,0

Some projects, notably neutron plugins, are using the neutron service as
a library. There is the neutron-lib package, but apparently they have
not moved everything needed over to there yet.

This is being added directly in stable branches only. Master needs to
get the latest version available, so these will need to be added at each
release so the stable branches use the correct version of neutron for
their respective stable release.

Py37 job always reports timeout error recently.
Please see [1] [2] [3].
At first it was suspected that the error was reported
because of the patch [4].
Therefore, Feng Shaohe's patch [5] revoked the merge,
and at this time, disappeared at py37 timeout.

But in fact, this problem is just hidden.
After removing this setting, the job of py37
is actually running on the environment of python 3.6
(community CI default version is 3.6), please see [6]
for detailed reasons.

Therefore, this patch exposes the hidden py37 timeout problem,
and at the same time, found method test_apply_patch_fpga_arq_monitor_job
, think it is the reason of the timeout. The reason I can find
this method is based on the the troubleshooting of tox -epy37 log.
After commenting out this method, I found that tox -epy37 can run
normally and there is no longer a timeout problem.

If you want to test, please ensure that you have a local
python3.7 environment, not 3.6, and execute rm .tox / -rf.
Then execute tox -epy37.

Therefore, the best way is to comment out this method and
restore py37 job at the same time.

If a friend discovers further reasons and solution, this method
can be restored, please refer to [7].

What went wrong in this method?
It is because in the deep call of this method, ThreadWork of
the thread pool will be used, which under Python3.7 will block
the execution of unit tests. For specific reasons, please see
[8] [9].

For large scale deployment, the dvr router will be installed to
the scheduled DHCP host. This will definitely increase the l3
agent service pressure, especially in large number of concurrent
updates, creation, or agent restart.

This patch adds a config ``host_dvr_for_dhcp`` for the DHCP port

This also makes ubuntu use appropriate python3 venv tooling and

Some distros do not install python3/python3-devel with the minimal

install either. This patch ensures that these packages get installed.

Ideally, PYTHON3_VERSION would be set *after* ensuring that python3

When we reach xtremio_volumes_per_glance_cache, it is not able
to create more clones for the image-volume therefore requires to
create a new cache entry.
Keeping in mind the case in [1], we can get CinderException for
various reasons from different drivers during the clone operation.
So we define a new exception for the xtremio driver to force create
a new cache entry when the limit reaches and not enforce the same
for other drivers.

Whenever we use share network subnets, we'd
always need the associated share networks; so
'joined' loading them makes sense rather than
lazy loading. Same is true for Share Group
Snapshots, since share group attributes are
relevant in contexts that snapshots are
referenced.

Fix the ORM relationship loading technique
and queries appropriately. Also convert share
network name into a property of the share
network subnet class.

In a Manila deployment using the Generic driver, it is possible
that the administrator has deployed manila-share on a machine that
already has access to the admin network used by Manila by being on
the same VLAN for example.

This means that it's not necessary for it to attempt to plug the ports
and do all the wiring due to the fact that it's already reachable,
therefore this patch introduces a new `interface_driver` which is
does nothing in order to avoid plugging/unplugging ports and avoiding
the requirement of running neutron-(openvswitch|linuxbridge)-agent
on the same node as manila-share.

The tests are pretty trivial because there's not much logic, but we
at least make sure that we don't call any ip_lib functions which means
we're not touching anything in host networking.

Ceph RBD backend ignores the `--incremental` option when creating a
volume backup. The first backup of a given volume is always a full
backup, and each subsequent backup is always an incremental backup.
This behavior makes it impossible to remove old backups while
keeping at least one recent backup.

Since Cinder will not find the latest_backup id as parent_id if
'--incremental=False', so we can use the parent_id to ensure
whether do the full backup in rbd driver or not.

If the incremental flag '--incremental' is not specified, this
patch will always create a new full backup for rbd volume.

The `interface_driver` option needs some clarification.
While we only support three interface mechanisms,
it's possible that deployers can use their own
interface driver, so using oslo_config's choices
for this option does not make sense.

In order to run PostgreSQL tests, we need to have the PostgreSQL
dependency available on the system.  We currently use the dependency
which forces building the Python package from source.  That makes
running the tests locally non-trivial and requiring the installation
of packages locally.

This patch moves that dependency to the binary one so that we can
simply deploy a binary artifact during CI, which simplifies the
abilitiy to run those tests.

In a Manila deployment using the Generic driver, it is possible
that the administrator has deployed manila-share on a machine that
already has access to the admin network used by Manila by being on
the same VLAN for example.

This means that it's not necessary for it to attempt to plug the ports
and do all the wiring due to the fact that it's already reachable,
therefore this patch introduces a new `interface_driver` which is
does nothing in order to avoid plugging/unplugging ports and avoiding
the requirement of running neutron-(openvswitch|linuxbridge)-agent
on the same node as manila-share.

The tests are pretty trivial because there's not much logic, but we
at least make sure that we don't call any ip_lib functions which means
we're not touching anything in host networking.

The code for clearing routes currently lives inside the

This patch refactors it into there, which can allow for a true

When a volume record is soft-deleted in the database,
dependent records in other tables (for example,
Transfers, VolumeGlanceMetadata, etc.) must be soft
deleted as well.  Otherwise, we will get FK dependency
errors when the database is purged.

This patch adds that support for VolumeAttachment table.
(other tables were already covered, just refactored)

Also adds tests.

Background:
As part of my work on reproducible builds for openSUSE, I check that software still gives identical build results in the future.
The usual offset is +15 years, because that is how long I expect some software will be used in some places.
This showed up failing tests in our package build.
See https://reproducible-builds.org/ for why this matters.

This makes it expire 1 year in the future to model realistic tokens.

NOTE: in addition to the orginal backport, this patch adds the following
changes. The changes has to be combined into a single patch in order to
avoid circular dependencies.

1. fixed the hadcoded token expiration date in
keystonemiddleware/tests/unit/client_fixtures.py. This is using the same
technique in the original backport.

2. fixed bandit complains in keystonemiddleware/auth_token/_request.py.
The request environment variable names are not tokens. We'll need to
mark them as false positives so bandit can stop chirping.

3. cherry-picked d68942d03d1628b0cc209024ec5966bc74f2f6d0 with U-C URL

The bootstrap logic doesn't take into consideration multiple roles
with the same name. If bootstrap is unable to determine which role to
use and accidentally uses a domain-specific role with the same name
as a default role, bootstrap will fail in unexpected ways.

This change deviates slightly from the upstream patches in that the
stable/rocky test_cli.py module doesn't have a `self.bootstrap`
attribute. Instead, we just test with `bootstrap` in the test itself.
Otherwise, the test is functionally the same.

and stable ironic-standalone job.

As CI images have pre-installed latest virtualenv package wich breaks
deployments. This will ensure that this package will be dropped and
appropriate one will be installed later.

This also makes ubuntu use appropriate python3 venv tooling and

Additionally virtualenv is dropped from requirements and ubuntu

to previous release

A pacemaker bundle can be restarted either because:
  . a tripleo config has been updated (from /var/lib/config-data)
  . the bundle config has been updated (container image, bundle
    parameter,...)

In HA services, special container ""*_restart_bundle"" is in charge
of restarting the HA service on tripleo config change. Special
container ""*_init_bundle"" handles restart on bundle config change.

When both types of change occur at the same time, the bundle must
be restarted first, so that the container has a chance to be
recreated with all bind-mounts updated before it tries to reload
the updated config.

Implement the improvement with two changes:

1. Make the ""*_restart_bundle"" start after the ""*_init_bundle"", and
make sure ""*_restart_bundle"" is only enabled after the initial
deployment.

2. During minor update, make sure that the ""*_restart_bundle"" not
only restarts the container, but also waits until the service
is operational (e.g. galera fully promoted to Master). This forces
the rolling restart to happen sequentially, and avoid service
disruption in quorum-based clustered services like galera and
rabbitmq.

Tested the following update use cases:

* minor update: ensure that *_restart_bundle restarts all types of
  resources (OCF, bundles, A/P, A/P Master/Slave).

* minor update: ensure *_restart_bundle is not executed when no
  config or image update happened for a service.

* restart_bundle: when resource (OCF or container) fails to
  restart, bail out early instead of waiting for nothing until
  timeout is reached.

* restart_bundle: make sure a resource is restarted even when it
  is in failed stated when *_restart_bundle is called.

* restart_bundle: A/P can be restarted on any node, so watch
  restart globally. When the resource restarts as Slave, continue
  watching for a Master elsewhere in the cluster.

* restart_bundle: if an A/P is not running locally, make sure it
  doesn't get restarted anywhere else in the cluster.

* restart_bundle: do not try to restart stopped (disabled) or
  unmanaged resource. Bail out early instead, to not wait until
  timeout is reached.

* stack update: make sure that running a stack update with no
  change does not trigger any *_restart_bundle, and does not
  restart any HA container either.

* stack update: when bundle and config will change, ensure bundle
  is updated before HA containers are restarted (e.g. HAProxy
  migration to TLS everywhere)

This patch fixes the issue by using a list comprehension instead of a
for loop over a list that was being modified within the loop.

Conflicts:
       keystone/tests/unit/protection/v3/test_assignment.py

Protection unit tests do not exist on this branch (stable/rocky) so
there is no need to modify the test_assignment.py protection tests.

This change replaces all of the roles references in our various files with the
new role name. This is being done because Ansible no longer allows hyphens in
role names.

TODO: (gchamoul) Remove healthcheck-service-status once this patch is
merged. Tripleo Jobs are RED due to THT trying to execute this
validation as inflight one but it has been renamed healthcheck_service_status.

After that, we submit them through the regular scheduler filters and weighers. If there are no valid weighed back ends, we error out with the usual ``No valid host found`` message.time. The driver can return one of the following status to indicate the current status of the share creation from snapshot:2. **STATUS_CREATING_FROM_SNAPSHOT**: the share is in ``creating`` status and can take some time to be available to the user. The share manager will periodically check the status of this share through a new periodic task. For backward compatibility, the vendors can continue to suppress the share status from the returned dictionary, that the share will be considered as available to user. A new intermediate status, ``STATUS_CREATING_FROM_SNAPSHOT``, will be added to assist share manager on filtering shares that are still working on copying data from a source snapshot. The new status can also be available to end users that may request a progress information, issuing the new API ``create_get_progress``. The share manager will have a new periodic task responsible for checking, using driver's interfaces, if shares that are in ``STATUS_CREATING_FROM_SNAPSHOT`` state have an update in their status. The manager will apply changes to the database and notify the user about them.A new API method is desirable to provide progress information regarding a share creation from a snapshot. The API will be modeled as a new share action: * Method: POST * URL: /v2/{project_id}/shares/{share_id}/action * Normal HTTP response code: 200(OK) * Expected HTTP error response codes: 400(Bad Request), 401(Unauthorized), 403 (Forbidden), 404(Not Found) It will accept the following payload:: { ""create_get_progress"": null } Expected response:: { ""total_progress"": 50 } Optionally, the driver can implement the interface to provide progress information for a share creation, returning the total progress in a percentage value. The default implementation will return **0%** for shares in ``STATUS_CREATING_FROM_SNAPSHOT`` and **100%** for shares in ``STATUS_AVAILABLE``. Optionally, the new API method ``create_get_progress`` can be implemented on the client to provide progress information to users.shares that remain with status equal to ``STATUS_CREATING_FROM_SNAPSHOT``. * New share API method to get share's progress information when creating from snapshot; * Scheduler's new filter ``CreateFromSnapshotFilter`` will be added to filter out incompatible back ends, only when the source share's ``snapshot_id`` is provided. share's status changes; * Default implementation for driver's interface ``create_get_progress``.

When end users boot instances, a `vnc password` option is provided to encrypt novnc console, and note that, this option is optional. Any user trying to access the console of instance with `vnc password` will get a locked window prompting for `vnc password`, and this provides almost the same experience as using VNC clients (e.g vncviewer) to access vnc servers that require password authentication . Problem description =================== Implement a safer noVNC console with password authentication. Use Cases --------- A safer noVNC console will benefit End User. And impacts on Developer/Deployer are as follows in #Documentation Impact# section. Proposed change =============== * Changes will be patched to python-novaclient `nova boot` subcommand to support `--vnc-password` option. Note that, considering not to affect present nova api and data models, the value will be passed to nova api via metadata of instance(as an expedient measure and will be poped later) * Changes will be patched to nova-api to: (1) pop possible `vnc password` from metadata (2) reject the request if nova-api detects that `vnc password` feature not enable after checking nova.conf ,but `vnc_password` parameter provided. (3) get `vnc password` populated in some persistent object that's accessible to nova-compute later. * Changes will be patched to nova-compute to recongnize `vnc password` and use it for libvirt XML (graphic defination) assembling. * Changes will be patched to nova-novncproxy to support rfb.VNC auth scheme. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- It does have impacts on end users: * When booting instance with web GUI, extra `vnc password` option will be prompted for input(it's optional). * Cloud operators will be provided with extra `--vnc-password` option (it's optional) when booting instance with nova/openstack CLI. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- New `vnc` option is added to auth_schemes list in `vnc` segment in `nova.conf`. This allows nova-novncproxy to detect and load rfb.VNC auth scheme. When nova-api receives instance creation requests with `vnc_password` in body, it also knows whether to reject or not. .. code-block:: ini [vnc] auth_schemes = none,vnc,vencrypt Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: pandatt Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * python-novaclient: new `--vnc-password` option and some codes processing this value shall be added. `vnc password` will be passed to nova-api via instance metadata later. * nova-api: some codes to validate `vnc password` and get it populated in some pesistent object(InstanceMetadata/ReqSpec, or something like that). Eventually, nova-compute gets the value. * nova-compute: some codes to assemble libvirt XML (graphic defination with `passwd` option) after checking `vnc password` and hypervisor. * nova-novncproxy: some codes to implement rfb.VNC auth scheme, security type negotiation (in current version, novncproxy tells tenant_sock to use hardcoded `vnc.AuthType.NONE` when serving as mediator between cli ent and vnc server, though noVNC client provides native support for `vnc.AuthType.VNC` with password security handshake handle) and `secu rity handshake` (no-ops, leave noVNC/websockify to do the stuff). Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Add releated unit test Documentation Impact ==================== * `Operation Guide` needs some updates, in #User-Facing Operations# section. The feature requires openstack CLI to specify an extra property `vnc password` when booting new instance. `vnc_password` can serve as a reserved property, new CLI may look like this: .. code-block:: $ openstack server create --image=test-image --flavor=1 \ --property vnc_password='inspur@123' ... demo $ nova boot --image test-image \ --flavor small \ --vnc-password inspur@123 \ ... demo * `API Guides` needs no updates. However, some texts should be posted to notify developers about how to benefit from this feature when booting new instance: .. code-block:: Request: { ""server"": { ""name"": ""demo"", ""imageRef"": ""70a599e0-31e7-49b7-b260-868f441e862b"", ""flavorRef"": ""small"", ""networks"": ""auto"", ""metadata"":{ ""vnc_password"":""inspur"" } } } * `Configuration Reference`&`Deployment Guides` need some updates. A change in nova.conf to enable rfb.VNC auth scheme is added (nova-novncproxy cares). .. code-block:: [vnc] ... auth_schemes = none,vnc,vencrypt References ========== * https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsGraphics * https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1180092 * https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing History ======= None ",,206,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================= Adopt Unified Limits in Nova ============================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/unified-limits-stein The spec is about adopting Keystone's unified-limits API to set quotas on Nova resource usage, using oslo-limits to enforce that limit. This spec proposes having unified limits in parallel with the existing quota system for stein, while operator feedback is collected. Problem description =================== Keystone has recentled added the ability to register limits for a given endpoint, with overides added for particular projects. They are creating os-limits to help assist with sharing the enforcement logic that can be shared between all projects adopting unified limits. Use Cases --------- * Operator sets limits in Keystone * Operator uses existing Nova APIs to set limits (via horizon) * Operator of Ironic based cloud wants to set limtis * Hierarchical limits * Operator wants to check current usage vs limits for given tenant Proposed change =============== The initial focus will be on the following limits we already support: * cores * ram In addition we will add limits for: * disk? * custom resource class (for ironic) Something we may need to support long term, but skip for now: * instances * other resource classes, like VGPU The current quota code allows per tenant settings for these items, these we should try to exclude unified limits, and move to global configuration settings only for these: * metadata_items * injected_files * injected_file_content_bytes * injected_file_path_bytes * key_pairs * server_groups * server_group_members There are network related limits that will not be checked by the new code: * fixed_ips * floating_ip * security_group_rules * networks Alternatives ------------ We could implement hiearhical quotas in isolation, and not adopt unified limts. To have a single API to set quotas across all service projects can't really be done without unified limits concept, although there are other ways it could be implemented. Data model impact ----------------- See upgrades, no changes in stein due to have old and new quota systems side by side. REST API impact --------------- The existing quota APIs will be deprecated by being removed in a microversion. As the existing APIs are used by Horizon and many operators scripts, they will need to be proxied to Keystone. This will however require extra configuration, the keystone endpoint id. Once using unified limits, operators should move to using Keystone's unified limit APIs to set and query limits. Usage information will still only by available via Nova, so there will still need to be an API to compare usage and limits. For hiearchicial limits, it would also be good to know the limit applied to the full tree, and the usage of the full tree. This is not being considered in this spec. TODO: should Keystone really call Nova to check usage and display the usage info in a unified way. Should it just be custom tooling via CLI tools, etc? Security impact --------------- ... Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- ... Performance Impact ------------------ It is possible to have more complicated quota counts with hierarchical quotas Other deployer impact --------------------- ... Developer impact ---------------- ... Upgrade impact -------------- Upgrade is hard here. First some important context. When getting tenant limits from keystone, we always get a result once the service endpoint default is added, we don't know if the per tenant setting has been migrated from Nova into Keystone. With fast forward upgrades, all services are down, so need to changes in keystone-manage to update the keystone DB, as the API is not available. We need a script to migrate default (config or API set) from Nova into Keystone, for cores and RAM. Then for each tenant we need to have their override copied into Keystone. Once moved to using unified limits, we switch the configuration over to enable unified limits. At this point we can delete all tenant overrides and defaults from the DB. The upgrade check will ensure that all those DB entried are removed. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: johnthetubaguy Other contributors: melwit alex_xu Work Items ---------- * Add calls to os_limits that can be enabled, guarded by config to enable it * Move quota APIs to proxy to Keystone when unified limit quotas enabled * Migrate default and tenant limits from Nova into Keystone * Upgrade checks to ensure above tooling is used Dependencies ============ * keystone manage commands to add limits when keystone API not available Testing ======= Grenade test that runs the migration of quota settings (after adding some quotas). Functional tests to ensure quotas are enforced based on unified limits correctly. Documentation Impact ==================== Need to tell Operators one how to Nova quotas should be updated via keystone. Notes on the changes to how quotas work. References ========== ...

We have two diametrically opposed use cases amongst our user base.

The first are the folks who just need tox/virtualenv to pre-exist,
so that they can do things like run tests. Neither tox nor virtualenv
themselves are fundamental to the thing under test, but are tools
that need to exist.

The second are folks for whom tools like pip or virtualenv are
essential to the software (such as OSA). For these users, it is
important that the version of those match what they expect their
users get from the distro.

Up until now, we've been using the pip-and-virtualenv element from
DIB which installs distro versions of pip and virtualenv, then
overwrites them with pip installed versions of the same, doing what
it can to prevent subsequent distro installs of the packages from
breaking things. This produces a really strange environment for
our friends in teh second camp, but honestly is a weird scenarios
to wrap the head around.

Instead, remove ALL distro packages of pip and virtualenv. Then
install both via get-pip. We can't do that on Centos7 for python3,
but that's ok, because get-pip installs into /usr/local in that
case.

Leave a cleanup script. Modern pip can uninstall stuff, including
itself. So uninstall the things that we install.  This cleanup
script can be run by folks like OSA in their first pre-playbook
in zuul, and then their jobs can subsequently apt-get or dnf
install python3-virtualenv or whatever they want to do that is
appropriate.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================= Add a nova-audit service for periodic maintenance ================================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/nova-audit Nova is a distributed system, which means that things fail in strange ways and data stored across multiple systems gets out of sync with the actual state of reality. Hosts and instances come and go, along with network connectivity, the message bus and database. Recently we have gained a number of ""heal $thing"" routines that operators can run either periodically or on demand to synchronize the states of various services and data stores to resolve or prevent problems. The number of these tasks is already overwhelming for the average operator, and tracking new tasks each cycle is not realistic. Problem description =================== As described above, we have an increasing number of maintenance tasks that need to be run in various scenarios. In most cases, these tasks are idempotent and safe to run even when nothing is wrong. Operators need a single mechanism for performing these maintenance tasks and healing activities that can be run periodically in the background with minimal impact to runtime performance, other than to hopefully fix problems related to inconsistencies before they become acute enough to get an human involved. Use Cases --------- As an operator, I would like Nova to heal itself whenever possible to minimize the number of support incidents requiring human intervention. As a user, I would like Nova to heal itself whenever possible to avoid having to involve support for transient issues, which may be impossible or expensive, especially during off-hour periods. Proposed change =============== We already have a number of these maintenance activities codified in one-shot commands that can be run on-demand once a problem has been identified. Since most of them are not harmful or overly expensive, we should be able to run those things periodically to attempt to fix problems automatically before the operator gets involved. This spec proposes a new binary called ``nova-audit`` to encapsulate these tasks. Ideally it should be usable in multiple ways: - As a singleton daemon that periodically runs tasks at various intervals according to their potential impact on the system and need. - As a one-shot ""fix stuff"" command that can be run from cron or otherwise scheduled or executed. - As a daemon or one-shot command that purely audits potential problems, but makes not changes. A new config section of ``[audit]`` would be added with timers and default values for each task. Current heal/sync/fix/cleanup tasks we have that could be integrated: ``heal_allocations`` -------------------- This task checks the consistency of allocations in Placement for instances in Nova. It has a runtime performance impact on both Placement and the Nova database. Many instances means this should probably check one instance per cycle, but potentially a short cycle time. ``sync_aggregates`` ------------------- This task checks that host aggregates match between Nova and Placement. It is required for some scheduler activities, but not all cases. It has a runtime performance impact on both Placement and the Nova database. Many hosts means this should probably check one aggregate per cycle. Aggregates generally change infrequently, so a long cycle time of an hour or more is probably reasonable. ``map_instances`` ----------------- This task checks that instances have a suitable mapping to a cell. It has a runtime performance impact on the Nova database. Many instances means this should probably check one instance per cycle, with a relatively short cycle time. It may also be better to check one cell at a time, very infrequently such as once per day. ``discover_hosts`` ------------------ This task ensures that newly-registered hypervisor hosts are mapped to the appropriate cell. This has a runtime impact on the Nova database, but there is an efficient way to query for unmapped hosts, so this can run relatively frequently, such as every ten minutes. ``archive_deleted_rows`` ------------------------ This task archives deleted data from the main database tables into the shadow tables. It has runtime a performance impact on the Nova database, both negative (while running) and positive (after running). Some people never run this, so a cycle time of once per day or week should be fine. This also needs a parameter to limit the scope of archived changes to a date range, defaulting to some multiple of the cycle time. ``purge`` --------- This task removes data from the shadow tables entirely. It has a runtime performance impact on the Nova database, but it is just deleting data from tables accessed only during the ``archive_deleted_rows`` operation. In reality, this should probably be run directly after the archival process, potentially with a different age scope. Alternatives ------------ We could obviously do nothing. People are managing the complexity today, so we could simply choose to let them continue. We could eliminate the daemon and scheduling nature of the proposal and just provide a very unified interface to running these commands -- a single place to find all the periodic maintenance tasks separate from the setup sort of things that ``nova-manage`` does. We could integrate this into ``nova-manage`` itself, under a ""maintenance"" subcommand or similar. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. You could argue that notifications sent about audit activity would be useful, but doing so would require more setup and configuration of this utility, as well as connectivity and credentials to the message bus. We could implement that later if there is a need. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ There will be some runtime performance impact due to the background nature of the audit and any cleanup that happens. Mitigation is to not run it, tune the intervals to be longer, or run it in single-shot mode when desired. Other deployer impact --------------------- Deployers will have to learn about and deploy a new command. This will hopefully be completely offeset by the reduced complexity of managing and maintaining Nova in the longer term. Developer impact ---------------- New maintenance tasks that are added will need to be done in an idempotent and efficient way and according to whatever interface for these commands is defined. Upgrade impact -------------- A new binary will be added, which will have some impact on upgrades. Any existing periodic maintenance jobs that call ``nova-manage`` for various tasks will need to convert over to the new command. The interfaces we have for existing things in ``nova-manage`` can be deprecated but maintained for an extended period to avoid breaking existing deployments. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: danms Feature Liaison --------------- Feature liaison: danms Work Items ---------- * Create a new ``nova-audit`` command and define scheduling mechanisms and internal interfaces. * Create the new config section and items. * Implement connectors to integrate the existing tasks we have into the new command. * Modify the ``nova-next`` job to run the audit command in single-shot mode after the tempest run, ideally removing the existing archive/purge invocation. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= Unit testing, and a single-shot run in the ``nova-next`` job as we currently do today for archive/purge. Documentation Impact ==================== Operator documentation about the new command, how to deploy it, and per-knob documentation about the impacts and suggested intervals.

The OVS agent processes the port events in a polling loop. It could
happen (and more frequently in a loaded OVS agent) that the ""removed""
and ""added"" events can happen in the same polling iteration. Because
of this, the same port is detected as ""removed"" and ""added"".

When the virtual machine is restarted, the port event sequence is
""removed"" and then ""added"". When both events are captured in the same
iteration, the port is already present in the bridge and the port is
discharted from the ""removed"" list.

Because the port was removed first and the added, the QoS policies do
not apply anymore (QoS and Queue registers, OF rules). If the QoS
policy does not change, the QoS agent driver will detect it and won't
call the QoS driver methods (based on the OVS agent QoS cache, storing
port and QoS rules). This will lead to an unconfigured port.

This patch solves this issue by detecting this double event and
registering it as ""removed_and_added"". When the ""added"" port is
handled, the QoS deletion method is called first (if needed) to remove
the unneded artifacts (OVS registers, OF rules) and remove the QoS
cache (port/QoS policy). Then the QoS policy is applied again on the
port.

NOTE: this is going to be quite difficult to be tested in a fullstack
test.

The installation locations of elastic beats are currently hardcoded
using openstack-ansible groups and cannot readily be extended to include
non-openstack hosts. This is particularly notable with auditbeat,
packetbeat and filebeat, which directly use the OSA 'hosts' group, and
metricbeat, which uses 'all'.

This commit allows these choices to be overrided by defining groups
named filebeat, metricbeat etc, with naming conventions as with the elk
integration inventory. Using integration inventories, one can include
the OSA groups within the override to extend the deployment. The defaults
are unchanged, with the exception of Metricbeat, which is now by default
deployed to the OSA groups 'hosts' and 'all_containers' instead of 'all'.

    [WARNING]: Failure using method (v2_playbook_on_stats) in callback plugin (<ans
    ible.plugins.callback./usr/share/ansible/plugins/callback/json_error.CallbackMo
    dule object at 0x7f6ee2270dd0>): [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'ansible-
    errors.json'

Given this plugin has no value, due to it being broken for a long time, we're removing it which
will stop the warning being raised in our ansible output.

* The test_json_error_callback role has also been removed, given this no longer serves any purpose.
* The molecule test layout has been updated so that we're no longer running this test.

Replace '' by [], so heat won't create an item in the list.
It helps to have idempotent containers, since podman_container module

Replacing to [] clears out empty volumes and makes these containers
idempotent when podman_container module is used to deploy containers.

If a user performs the image-create action on such an instance, and the new image inherits the ``cinder_encryption_key_id`` and ``cinder_encryption_key_deletion_policy`` image properties (which happens in the default configuration), when the new image is deleted, the encryption key for the *original* image will be deleted, thereby rendering it unusable for the normal workflow of creating a volume from the image and booting an instance from the volume. The fix for this issue is to include both ``cinder_encryption_key_id`` and ``cinder_encryption_key_deletion_policy`` in the ``non_inheritable_image_properties`` list in ``nova.conf``. upgrade: - | The image properties ``cinder_encryption_key_id`` and ``cinder_encryption_key_deletion_policy`` are now included by default in the ``non_inheritable_image_properties`` configuration option.

Some containers doesn't have the ""default"" user set to root (which is
good). This lead to healthcheck_port() function to return a message
because the non-root user isn't allowed to call ""ss"" command as itself.

Ensuring we're running the healthchecks as root will also allow to stop
duplicating some commands, making them faster and smaller for the
system.

This was discovered and discussed on Red Hat bugzilla first, then ported
to Launchpad.

In I98963941c9d969ab1dfd92d70f973013f84e1c25, we removed
/var/lib/docker-puppet and
/var/lib/tripleo-config/container-startup-config-*.json.
Also, since the usage of container_puppet_config, there is no more
'hashed-' file when a container has a new config hash. The hash is
included in the same container config file.

The container_puppet_config module will take care of making sure no old
container startup config remains in /var/lib/tripleo-config as well as
hashed files; which aren't useful anymore and could cause troubles and
confusion.

This patch will have to be backported to stable/train.

Implement tripleo-systemd-wrapper role

This patch adds a new role that will be used to manage side containers
with systemd instead of docker.socket or nsenter.  The main use case here
is Neutron, although this role is designed to work with any service.

This role will create a series of systemd files to monitor a file which
gets mounted into a container. Additionally a wrapper script is
generated which is mounted in the container that will provide the
arguments that should be used to launch new containers.

(cherry picked from commit 699249f1790dd5646556173bf5331e7e71135ad4)

This is the commit message #2:

Remove --rm=true from sidecar container sync

Neutron uses kill-scripts which remove the container after stopping it.
If the container is launched with docker and --rm=true, the container
will automatically be cleaned up and the $(CLI) rm <container id> in the
kill script with error out because the container can't be found.

This is the commit message #3:

Fix substitution in kill-script

In the kill-script there is a string ""Unknown action ${SIG} for
${$CT_NAME} ${CT_ID}"" which results in a ""bad substitution"" error, as
there is no variable named with what the contents of the CT_NAME
environment variable contains.  Remove the extraneous '$'.

This is the commit message #4:

Add handling of signal 15 in kill script

The reason bug #1860155 was triggered was because the kill script did
not have a stanza for handling the signal that was passed in, which is
signal 15.  Since signal 15 is unhandled, keepalived processes will
still stick around.  Add handling for signal 15.

These 3 backports will save a bit of time during train deployments.

Ensure service log folder permissions

We should ensure that the service folders are 0750. We're setting
/var/log/containers but we should also ensure the service folders also
have the correct permissions.

Change-Id: I28e8017edc7e30a60288adf846da722fd6ab310e
(cherry picked from commit f2147c9974c5e4d9fec91e87a2a42a7c0b8c9d5d)

Drop legacy log folder and readme

We switched to containers a long time ago. This patch drops the
management of a /var/log/<service> directory and the creation of a
readme indicating that we've moved to containers which makes the logging
available under /var/log/containers/<service>

Change-Id: Ia4e991d5d937031ac3312f639b726a944743dd1e
(cherry picked from commit 7906fb43be72a150b5d10e0e18b21b568895b6e0)

Readd creation of /var/log/mariadb directory

https://review.opendev.org/#/c/692850/ cleaned up the
legacy directories, but since then rhel8 jobs fails while
starting galera containers with error of missing
directory /var/log/mariadb, this patch adds it again.

Redfish defines some of the fields in its JSON schemas as
mandatory. However, some implementations ignore this requirement
and occasionally omit some required fields in the Redfish document
tree they produce.

Failing the whole Redfish interaction basing solely on the absence
of a required (bit non-essential) field makes sushy perfect, but not
exactly practical.

This patch changes to semantics of the `default` parameter in
``Field` constructor in a way that it can inhibit otherwise fatal
failure when a select of required attributes are missing.

Along this mis/feature, some non-essential fields in Redfish
message registry have been made required and defaulted effectively
making them non-required.

features which will slow down guest performance.
It is useful for guest workloads that can't tolerate any potential

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================================== Live migration no performance impact ==================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/live-migration-no-performance-impact Problem description =================== Auto converge and post copy are features from QEMU, for living migration can be completed. Auto converge will slow down the CPU speed and memory I/O speed to ensure memory can be copied to destination node. Post copy will boot an instance at destination node and access the memory from source node remotely. Currently auto converge and post copy can only be enabled/disabled via configuration, which means the configurations will effect all instance on the host during live migration. If an application which sensitive to reduced performance (some scientific computing applications may be more sensitive to memory access latency), and the instance is on a host with these options enabled, live migration may cause the application to raise an error. Therefore, the user wants to control whether to enable/disable auto converge or post copy during live migration. Use Cases --------- * As an administrator, I want the user can tag the instance request no performance impact themselves. * As an operator, I want the live migrate success and not take too long time. * As a user, I want the live migrate do not impact the performance for some performance sensitive applications. Proposed change =============== This spec proposes to add no performance impact parameter to live migrate API call. The request for ``POST /servers/{server_id}/action`` where action is ""os-migrateLive"" will get a new optional parameter called ``no_performance_impact``. If the parameter is specified, it will disable auto converge and post copy during the live migration even if they are enabled in the configuration. .. note:: The new parameter would only affect the live migrate API call, it will not affect the force complete migration API call. .. note:: User can tag their instances as **no performance impact** via instance metadata or somewhere else, then operator can check the tag to decide whether add the new parameter before live migrate to avoid performance impact during the live migration. The form of the tag will not be specified in this spec, which should be negotiated by the administrator and operator, and inform the user how to use it. Alternatives ------------ * Another method is to expose ""auto-converge"" and ""post-copy"" in API. [1]_ This can be worked, but it expose the features of hypervisor directly. * We can expose ""auto-converge"" and ""post-copy"" in flavor extra specs and image properties. [2]_ But it have same issues as above, even expose the features to end users. It increases administrator management costs as well as operation and maintenance costs. Data model impact ----------------- A ``no_performance_impact`` boolean column, which defaults to False, will be added to the ``migrations`` DB table and related versioned object. REST API impact --------------- The request for ``POST /servers/{server_id}/action`` where action is ""os-migrateLive"" will get a new optional parameter called ``no_performance_impact``. A sample JSON request with ``no_performance_impact`` for living migrate a server would like this:: { ""os-migrateLive"": { . . . ""no_performance_impact"": true } } .. note:: If ``no_performance_impact`` not set in the request, it will default to **false**. ``no_performance_impact`` will be exposed through ``GET /os-migrations``, ``GET /servers/{server_id}/migrations`` and ``GET /servers/{server_id}/migrations/{migration_id}``. A sample JSON response would look like below for a migration:: { ""migrations"": [ { . . . ""no_performance_impact"": true } ] } Filtering/Sorting: The ``no_performance_impact`` key will be added to the existing list of valid sorting/filtering keys so that migrations can be filtered/sorted based on this field.

Change [1] introduced a conditional call to Field's
""adapter"" callable supposedly to work-around some OEM issues.
Sadly, the exact problem that change [1] has been trying to
solve was never explained and remains murky.

However, fix [1] has also introduced a bug which makes sushy
ignoring 'None' literals in the values. This sometimes leads
to sushy failing to operate on perfectly valid JSON documents.

This change removes most of the conditions guarding Field's
""adapter"" function calls.

The tripleo-upgrade has a workarounds logic which allows us to
apply patches or specific modifications prior and after some of
the upgrade steps. However, if these workarouds need to be applied
in the overcloud nodes, the only way to do it was via a bash script
which would iterate over the nodes and apply the patch or perform a
change on each of the nodes.

This patch adds a new workarounds field: ansible_hosts. When this
option will be present in the workaround and it will be different
than an empty string then the workaround will be aplied via Ansible in
the nodes specified in that ansible_hosts field. This ansible_hosts
option needs to be used in combination with the command one, as
the command will be transformed in a shell Ansible task which will
be executed in the nodes passed in the ansible_hosts option.

Example:
pre_overcloud_upgrade_prepare_workarounds:
- set_root_password:
    patch: false
    basedir: ''
    id: ''
    ansible_hosts: 'overcloud'
    command: |
        echo redhat | passwd root --stdin

will turn into a set_root_password.yaml Ansible playbook under
~/ansible_workarounds:

cat ~/ansible_workarounds/set_root_password.yaml
- hosts: overcloud
  tasks:
    - name: set_root_password workaround
      shell: |
        echo redhat | passwd root --stdin

When executing the workarounds, a new bash function ansible_patch
has been included which will take care of executing the generated
Ansible playbook.

Also, an optional input parameter could be passed to workarounds.sh,
when passed, it will be taken as input for the --limit option when
executing ansible-playbook. This way, we can execute a workaround
specifically in a server, instead of running it in all of them.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================== Filter nodes by owner ===================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/ironic-tenant-filter Add a scheduler filter to restrict non-admins to only baremetal nodes that they own. Problem description =================== Nova interacts with Ironic as a user with administrative privileges which means it is able to provision any available baremetal node. Nova needs to be aware of Ironic's multi-tenant features so that it only attempts to use baremetal nodes that belong to the tenant initiating the provisioning request with Nova. [1]_ Use Cases --------- As a cloud provider, I want to assign one or more nodes to a tenant and then have those tenants restricted to those nodes when creating a baremetal server using the compute service. Proposed change =============== Ironic nodes have an optional ""owner"" field [2]_ which can be a project ID. This blueprint would use that owner field to filter nodes based on owner. The compute service will report the node owner via the ``ComputeNode.stats`` attribute that is already used today to report node capabilities to the scheduler filters. Note that if the owner of an available node is changed the new owner will not be reported to the ``nova-scheduler`` service until the ``update_available_resource`` periodic task runs on the ``nova-compute`` service. This spec does not propose any sort of external server event changes in the API or listening for notifications from ironic for node changes. A new (traditional) scheduler filter will be added [3]_ which will be used to filter nodes by the ``RequestSpec.project_id`` field for non-admins. The following rules will apply to the filter: * non-ironic nodes pass the filter as they do not apply * admins have access to any available node regardless of owner * non-admins only have access to the nodes they own * nodes without an owner are not available to non-admins Alternatives ------------ I initially tried writing a placement pre-filter [4]_ using a required trait for the node owner but that does not work since it incorrectly filtered out non-ironic nodes which will break a mixed hypervisor deployment. We also cannot use the `AggregateMultiTenancyIsolation`_ filter because that relies on host aggregates which are `not supported`_ at the node level. .. _AggregateMultiTenancyIsolation: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/configuration/schedulers.html#aggregatemultitenancyisolation .. _not supported: https://review.opendev.org/526753/ Data model impact ----------------- None, though the RequestSpec object might need to grow a field to indicate if the request is coming from an admin. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- This should improve security by restricting tenants to only the nodes that they own. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ An additional scheduler filter means more time will be taken overall during scheduling but the filter will be disabled by default and even when enabled the filter should be fast. Other deployer impact --------------------- Deployers that wish to use this feature will need to ensure their tenant users own baremetal nodes and then enable the filter. Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- None. While there could be provisioned nodes without an owner in an existing deployment, the nova instances for those nodes cannot be migrated to another compute host so they will not go through the scheduler and fail the new filter. In other words, the new filter is essentially only enforced when creating new baremetal servers. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: mriedem <mriedem.os@gmail.com> Other contributors: Potentially `MOC`_ developers .. _MOC: https://github.com/CCI-MOC/esi Feature Liaison --------------- Feature liaison: mriedem Work Items ---------- * Update the openstacksdk to get the node owner field (done [5]_) * Update the ironic virt driver code to expose the node owner, if set, in the ``ComputeNode.stats`` field during the ``update_available_resource`` routine. * Add a new ``NodeOwnerFilter`` scheduler filter. * Tests and docs. Dependencies ============ While not a strict dependency ironic needs to restrict the ability to change the owner of a provisioned node [6]_. Testing ======= Unit and functional tests. Documentation Impact ==================== Within nova the scheduler filter docs should be updated [7]_ [8]_. Within ironic the scheduler filter should be mentioned, perhaps in the install and configuration guide [9]_. References ========== ..

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. ================================= Use PCPU and VCPU in One Instance ================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/use-pcpu-and-vcpu-in-one-instance The spec `CPU resource tracking`_ splits host CPUs into the ``PCPU`` resources and the ``VCPU`` resources, make it possible to run instances of ``dedicated`` CPU allocation policy and instances of ``shared`` CPU allocation policy on the same host. This spec aims to create an instance with partial instance CPUs running with ``dedicated`` CPU allocation policy and allocated from ``PCPU`` resource class, and the rest instance CPUs running in ``shared`` policy and allocating from ``VCPU`` resource class. Problem description =================== The current CPU allocation policies, ``dedicated`` or ``shared``, are applied to while CPUs of an instance, after the introduction of `CPU resource tracking`_ it is possible to propose a more fine-grained CPU allocation policy, which is based the control over individual instance CPU, to specify the ``dedicated`` or ``shared`` CPU allocation policy to each instance CPU. Use Cases --------- As a NFV user, I want CPUs of different performance priority to meet the characterization of workloads from different sub-module. One example is the OVS workload, in which the CPUs for the data plane are usually required to respond to network traffic as quick as possible to seek the high performance, while the control plane CPUs may not have too much pressure on performance and could be assigned with CPUs that shared by other instances. This proposal in this spec could help to deploy more similar OVS nodes on the same host without force all instance CPUs to occupy the host CPUs exclusively. As a Kubernetes administrator I wish to run a multi-tier or auto-scaling application in Kubernetes, which is running in single OpenStack VM, with the expectation that using dedicated high performance CPUs for application itself and deploying the containers on shared cores. Proposed change =============== Tracking the dedicated CPUs of instance --------------------------------------- Add a new extra specs and image metadata:: ``hw:cpus.dedicated=<cpuset string>`` or ``hw_cpus.dedicated=<cpuset string>`` Image metadata ``hw_cpus.dedicated`` only works when extra specs ``hw:cpus.dedicated`` is not set in the instance flavor properties. The CPUs appeared in list of ``hw:cpus.dedicated`` or ``hw_cpus.dedicated`` will be allocated from host's ``PCPU`` resource, which is called the instance ``dedicated`` CPUs. The CPUs specified in ``<cpuset string>`` are expected to be a sub set or the same value of CPU list specified in instance ``flavor.cpuset``, and the CPUs that appear in ``cpuset`` but not in the list of the ``dedicated`` CPU list will be allocated from host's ``VCPU`` resource and called the instance ``shared`` CPUs. An instance that the ``dedicated`` CPU list is not empty implies it is a NUMA awareness instance and the extra specs ``hw:numa_nodes`` is set to 1 if it is not set in the flavor properties:: flavor: vcpus=4 memory_mb=512 extra_specs: hw:cpus.dedicated=0,2 New instance CPU policy based on single vCPU ---------------------------------------------- ``CPUAllocationPolicy.DEDICATED`` and ``CPUAllocationPolicy.SHARED`` are the current instance CPU allocation policies, which are applied to all CPUs belonging to the instance. This proposal brings an instance CPU allocation policy in a granularity of single instance CPU, the CPU appeared in the instance ``dedicated`` CPU list will be allocated from host's ``PCPU`` resource class, and the instance CPU is not shown in the ``dedicated`` CPU list will be allocated from ``VCPU`` resource class. To keep compatibility, if extra specs ``hw:cpus.dedicated`` or image metadata ``hw_cpus.dedicated`` is not empty, instance CPU allocation policy specified in ``hw:cpu_policy`` or ``hw_cpu_policy`` will be omitted. Otherwise the old fashion CPU allocation policy will be used. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- ``InstanceNUMACell`` needs to be upgraded to track the ``dedicated`` CPUs that belong to particular instance NUMA node. It is expected that ``NUMACell`` object is also upgraded in the implementation of `CPU resource tracking`_ for tracking the host NUMA specific ``PCPU`` resources. Since the code of `CPU resource tracking`_ is not ready until now, the final changes toward ``NUMACell`` object needs to be reviews after the code has been accepted. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ ``InstanceNUMACell`` and ``NUMACell`` will be changed, this brings some extra criteria to in Nova scheduler's filtering and weight layers, but the performance impact should be pretty trivial. Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- New extra spec and image metadata have been introduced to set CPU allocation policy for individual instance CPU. The ``hw:cpu_policy`` extra spec as well as the image metadata ``hw_cpu_policy`` works in the old fashion when ``hw:cpus.dedicated`` or ``hw_cpus.dedicated`` is not specified in instance flavor. Implementation ============== Code of dependency spec `CPU resource tracking`_ is still in coding, it is expected that some there is some code in creating the CPU mapping between instance NUMA cell ``shared`` vCPUs and some host NUMA cell VCPUs through libvirt driver. Both host and instance NUMA cell need to track the PCPU information and it is required to modify the ``NUMACell`` and ``InstanceNUMACell`` objects to keep the ``dedicated`` CPUs. The ``shared`` CPUs are the remaining CPUs that no showing in the host or instance NUMA cell ``dedicated`` CPU list. Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Wang, Huaqiang <huaqiang.wang@intel.com> Other contributors: Alex Xu <hejie.xu@intel.com> Work Items ---------- * Add new extra spec and image metadata for ``dedicated`` CPUs * Change the default CPU allocation policy * Report dedicated and shared host CPUs per NUMA cell to DB if required * Report dedicated and shared instance CPUs per NUMA cell to DB Dependencies ============ * `CPU resource tracking`_: The proposing spec is based on the ``PCPU`` resource and ``VCPU`` resource defined in this spec. And the final implementation of this spec is a hard dependency. Testing ======= The unit tests and functional tests will be required. Documentation Impact ==================== The administrator document should be added to introduce the usage of extra spec ``hw:cpu.dedicated`` and notice the compatibility with ``hw:cpu_policy``.

Problem description =================== Currently, the Linux operating system supports the root user to reset it's own password, and the window operating system supports the administrator to reset it's own password, but they are cannot reset the normal user's password. In fact, a server has more than one user (contains root or administrator) in the production environment. Sometimes, because the user does not log in for a long time, the password is forgotten.

Add ``userName`` and ``userPass`` to the changePassword Action API's request body. Provide a new request body containing only the ``userName`` and ``userPass`` parameters.

Shared resource providers are marked with a standard trait called `MISC_SHARES_VIA_AGGREGATE`. This indicates that the provider allows its inventory to be consumed by other resource providers associated via an aggregate link. For example, assume we have two compute nodes, CN_1 and CN_2, each with inventory of VCPU and MEMORY_MB but not DISK_GB (in other words, these are compute nodes with no local disk). There is a resource provider called ""NFS_SHARE"" that has an inventory of DISK_GB and has the MISC_SHARES_VIA_AGGREGATE trait. Both the ""CN_1"" and ""CN_2"" compute node resource providers and the ""NFS_SHARE"" resource provider are associated with an aggregate called ""AGG_1"". Problem description =================== In Rocky release, Patch [1]_ was reverted back due to below reasons as reported in LP bug 1784020 [2]_. #. On upgrade from previous release, any existing allocations against the compute node provider's DISK_GB inventory will not allow removal of the DISK_GB inventory from the compute node provider during the update_available_resource periodic task. In other words, we have no data migration routine in place to move DISK_GB allocations from the compute node provider to the shared storage provider in Rocky. #. During a move operation, we move the instance's allocations from the source compute node provider to the migration record, then go through the scheduler to pick a dest host for the instance and allocate resources against the destination host (and optionally shared storage provider). So, * The DISK_GB allocation from the instance to the shared storage provider is deleted for a short window of time during scheduling until we pick a destination host. * If cold migrate fails or is reverted, we delete the allocations (created by the scheduler) and move the allocations from the migration record (against the source node provider) back to the instance, but because we failed to move the DISK_GB allocation against the sharing provider as pointed in above point for the instance to the migration record, we've lost that DISK_GB allocation when copying it back to the instance on revert/failure. #. Live migration and evacuation fails when APIs are called with `force` flag as it bypasses scheduler thereby completely ignoring shared resource provider allocations. #. The hypervisor details shows incorrect DISK_GB related data. Use Cases --------- #. Allow compute node resource providers to use NFS or any other shared storage systems for storing instance files and report it's correct disk usages in the shared storage resource providers instead of respective compute node resource providers. #. Avoid the need for ssh access across compute hosts during a resize if those hosts are using the same shared storage resource provider as described in specs `resize-on-shared-storage-without-ssh-keys spec <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/551927>`_. Proposed change =============== Need patch [3]_ changes so that libvirt driver doesn't report DISK_GB inventory if it's in a shared storage provider aggregate relationship. Upgrade DISK_GB from compute node to shared storage resource provider ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Add data migration routine using reshape functionality which will do following things at the startup of the compute service: 1. Check if compute node is configured to use DISK_GB resources from a shared resource provider and the DISK_GB resource is also present in the compute node root resource provider. If above condition is True, it means Reshape is needed. 2. Add a new data migration metho to move the allocations of DISK_GB resource from compute node resource provider to the shared storage resource provider. Move operation ----------------- During moving allocations from instance to the migration record, if placement service goes down or for some unknown reasons the cold migration fails, then we can make use of `orig_alloc` which holds the original allocations of an instance to add these allocations back to the instance. To do this, `replace_allocation_with_migration` method will need to be modified to set `orig_alloc` to MigrationTask._held_allocations object and take necessary actions in rollback method. Live migration and evacuation ------------------------------- In Stein release in microversion 2.68, force flag is removed from live migration and evacuation. So users are encouraged to use this microversion to avert issues as mentioned in problem description in Point 3. Show correct DISK_GB data in hypervisor details ------------------------------------------------ When a compute node is configured to use DISK_GB resources from a shared storage resource provider, it won't report DISK_GB resources in the inventory. The resource tracker will get the actual disk resources information from a shared storage resource provider and update ""local_gb"" and ""free_disk_gb"" so that correct information is available when a hypervisor usage is queried. The calculation of ""local_gb_used"" logic will remain intact. Alternatives ------------ As of today it's possible to configure shared storage resource providers with the compute nodes using `MISC_SHARES_VIA_AGGREGATE` in Placement service and use it in Nova but it comes with caveats as described in bug [2]_. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- Operator will need to perform below steps to enable this functionality:- 1. Create a shared storage resource provider for e.g. NFS_SHARE 2. Add ""DISK_GB"" inventory to NFS_SHARE 3. Add `MISC_SHARES_VIA_AGGREGATE` trait to NFS_SHARE 4. Create an aggregate for e.g. ""AGG_1"" 5. Associate ""NFS_SHARE"" share resource provider and all compute nodes which you want to use ""DISK_GB"" inventory from ""NFS_SHARE"" shared provider with an aggregate ""AGG_1"" Developer impact ---------------- Planning to implement this change only in libvirt driver as ""update_provider_tree"" method is not supported in some of the other hypervisors except ""powervm"". Upgrade impact -------------- If a compute node is configured to use DISK_GB resources from a shared resource provider in a `Train` release, then it will be detected automatically during the startup of the compute service and it will take following actions: 1. Check if compute node is configured to use DISK_GB resources from a shared resource provider and the DISK_GB resource is also present in the compute node root resource provider. If above condition is True, it means Reshape is needed. 2. In the data migration method, it will move the allocations of DISK_GB resource from compute node resource provider to the shared storage resource provider. From operator perspective, he/she will need to configure shared storage resource provider and simply restart the compute service and the migration of allocations from compute node to the shared storage resource provider will happen seamlessly.

If glance and nova are both configured with RBD backend, but glance
does not return location information from the API, nova will fail to
clone the image from glance pool and will download it from the API.
In this case, image will be already flat, and subsequent flatten call
will fail.

This commit makes flatten call idempotent, so that it ignores already
flat images by catching ImageUnacceptable when requesting parent info
from ceph.

Since tox.ini explicitily makes reference to python3.6
command, all CI jobs derived from 'tempest-full-py3'
could potentially fail if default 'python3-devel'
package reffers to another python version than the 3.6

For example this DevStack Fedora job is failing:
 - https://zuul.opendev.org/t/openstack/job/devstack-platform-fedora-latest

To fix this problem let reference to python36-devel package
in bindep.txt and let explicitily tell DevStack jobs
derived from 'tempest-full-py3 job' to use python3.6
command instead of python3 (so that required packages
are installed using it).

Despite the fact tempest and openstack services could
perfectly work using different python3 versions, this change is
fixing it to python3.6 should help semplifying technical depts
involved with maintaning CI jobs.
