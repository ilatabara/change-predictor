These projects may be vulnerable to ARP spoofing, risking the possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks. If using a version of Open vSwitch that supports ARP field matching, you can help mitigate this risk by enabling the ``prevent_arp_spoofing`` option for the OpenvSwitch agent. This option prevents instances from performing spoof attacks; it does not protect them from spoof attacks. Note that this feature was added in Kilo, was deprecated in Newton, and is expected to be removed in Ocata. For example, in ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/openvswitch_agent.ini``: .. code:: ini prevent_arp_spoofing = True .. note:: Even with ``prevent_arp_spoofing`` enabled, flat networking does not provide a complete level of project isolation, as all project traffic is still sent to the same VLAN.",,26,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ======================================== Block Device Setup Level 1: Partitioning ======================================== During the creation of a disk image (e.g. for a VM), there is the need to create, setup, configure and afterwards detach some kind of storage where the newly installed OS can be copied to or directly installed in. Remark ------ The implementation for this proposed changed already exists, was discussed and is currently waiting for reviews [1]. To have a complete overview over the block device setup, this document is provided. The dependencies are not implemented as they should be, because * the spec process is currently in the phase of discussion and not finalized [2], * the implementation was finished and reviewed before the spec process was described. [1] Problem description =================== When setting up a block device there is the need to partitioning the block device. Use Cases --------- User (Actor: End User) wants to create multiple partitions in multiple block devices where the new system is installed in. The user wants to specify if the image should be optimized for speed or for size. The user wants the same behavior independently of the current host or target OS. Proposed change =============== Move the partitioning functionality from `elements/vm/block-device.d/10-partition` to a new block_device python module: `level1/partitioning.py`. Instead of using a program or a library, the data is written directly with the help of python `file.write()` into the disk image. Alternatives ------------ The existing implementation uses the `parted` program (old versions of DIB were using `sfdisk`). The first implementations of this change used the python-parted library. All these approaches have a major drawback: they automatically *optimize* based on information collected on the host system - and not of the target system. Therefore the resulting partitioning layout may lead to a degradation of performance on the target system. A change in these external programs and libraries also lead to errors during a DIB run [4] or there are general issues [7]. Also everything build around GNU parted falls under the GPL2 (not LGPL2) license - which is incompatible with the currently used Apache license in diskimage-builder. API impact ---------- Extends the (optional) environment variable ``DIB_BLOCK_DEVICE_CONFIG``: a JSON structure to configure the (complete) block device setup. For this proposal the second entry in the original list will be used (the first part (as described in [5]) is used by the level 0 modules). The name of this module is `partitioning` (element[0]). The value (element[1]) is a dictionary. For each disk that should be partitioned there exists one entry in the dictionary. The key is the name of the disk (see [5] how to specify names for block device level 0). The value is a dictionary that defines the partitioning of each disk. There are the following key / value pairs to define one disk: label (mandatory) Possible values: 'mbr' This uses the Master Boot Record (MBR) layout for the disk. (Later on this can be extended, e.g. using GPT). align (optional - default value '1MiB') Set the alignment of the partition. This must be a multiple of the block size (i.e. 512 bytes). The default of 1MiB (~ 2048 * 512 bytes blocks) is the default for modern systems and known to perform well on a wide range of targets [6]. For each partition there might be some space that is not used - which is `align` - 512 bytes. For the default of 1MiB exactly 1048064 bytes (= 1 MiB - 512 byte) are not used in the partition itself. Please note that if a boot loader should be written to the disk or partition, there is a need for some space. E.g. grub needs 63 * 512 byte blocks between the MBR and the start of the partition data; this means when grub will be installed, the `align` must be set at least to 64 * 512 byte = 32 KiB. partitions (mandatory) A list of dictionaries. Each dictionary describes one partition. The following key / value pairs can be given for each partition: name (mandatory) The name of the partition. With the help of this name, the partition can later be referenced, e.g. while creating a file system. flags (optional) List of flags for the partition. Default: empty. Possible values: boot Sets the boot flag for the partition size (mandatory) The size of the partition. The size can either be an absolute number using units like `10GiB` or `1.75TB` or relative (percentage) numbers: in the later case the size is calculated based on the remaining free space. Example: :: [""partitioning"", {""rootdisk"": { ""label"": ""mbr"", ""partitions"": [{""name"": ""part-01"", ""flags"": [""boot""], ""size"": ""100%""}]}}] Security impact --------------- None - functionality stays the same. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ Measurements showed there is a performance degradation for the target system of the partition table is not correctly aligned: writing takes about three times longer on an incorrect aligned system vs. one that is correctly aligned. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ansreas (andreas@florath.net) Work Items ---------- None - this is already a small part of a bigger change [1]. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= The refactoring introduces no new test cases: the functionality is tested during each existing test building VM images.

It was noticed on a very busy system this can take about 1s per loop.
This starts to add up on thousands of processes.

Firstly, prune out all the kernel threads.  Then introduce a very
small inline python script to find any pids that seem to be in the
chroot without forking to examine each one.  After that the existing
loop just kills anything as before.

On Debian network configuration can be done via /etc/network/interfaces.
It can accept a statement to load additional files, which varied in
history:

Wheezy only supports 'source' (see b822581)
Jessie supports 'source-directory' and comes with the statement by
default.

However since 754dd05 we inconditionally inject 'source', thus on Jessie
the configuration ends up with:

 source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
 source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

When networking is started, 'ifup -a' parses the list of interfaces
twice. When configured with dhcp, that causes two dhclient to spawn
which might conflict with each other.

Inject the source statement only if there is neither a source or
source-directory with the same path.

the current command to retrieve the cidr of the ctlplane subnet is
giving inconsistent values. neutronclient somehow changed the behaviour
and is returning a json object that should be parsed.
The change uses osc to retrieve subnet id, and then uses neutronclient
to retrieve the exact cidr value.
This is the most compatible way to do this across all the releases.

1.Backup of ISCSI volume with chap enabled on it, fails
because it choose online copy code path where copy
volume is background process on 3par and we do not
wait for process to complete and setting of any attribute
on cloned volume failed during online copy of data.
This patch ensures it choses non online copy code path
for above scenario.

2.Backup of attached volume fails with snapCPG error
Sometime, during online clone operation, we set snapCPG and
userCPG on cloned volume but when we get cpg of
cloned volume we get an error as these attributes
do not set for cloned volume on 3par.
This patch ensure if cpg is not available for volume
from 3par it will take default value from 'host' attribute
from volume param.

Cinder creates volume from source volume or snapshot by cloning
volume in backend storage without considering whether two volumes
have same encryptions. This leads that an encryption volume may
have unencrypted data, or vice visa.

Currently we have a solution that creating different volumes with
different encryptions by creating and retyping.

In Ocata release we won't implement function that creating volume
from source with different encryptions, whether to do it needs to
discuss.

This patch adds support for snapshots to the NFS driver.

This functionality is only enabled if
""nfs_snapshot_support"" is set to True in cinder.conf
and nas_secure_file_operations is disabled.

This is because compute nodes running libvirt <1.2.7 will
encounter problems with snapshot deletion, which includes
Ubuntu 14.04 and requires write access to the volumes
created by a different user. Therefore, deployers must
opt-in to this functionality if their environment is known
to support it.

Due libvirt limitations[1], apparmor must be disabled in the
compute nodes or the volume export location be added to
libvirt's default profile template[3].

Clonning volumes is only supported if the source volume
is not attached.

Some schenarios are listed below for context: - `Client / Server updating DNS names <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771255.aspx>`_ - OpenShift / Cloudfoundry updating instance names via nsupdate - Any arbitrary system that support dynamic name updates. Proposed change =============== This spec defines in detail the Designate needed for Inbound RR Updates. - Designate currently doesn't support multiple modifications within a single TX, so if multiple updates where to be issues as a series / mulitple RPC calls it would leave inconcistency for a Zone. - SOA serial update via dynamic update will not be allowed as this is done. Steps ^^^^^ #. Incoming RR update #. Process Zone section of request (**See RFC section 3.1**) #. Check that the Zone section contains 1 RR and that is a SOA else FORMERR. #. Check that the Zone name + class is managed by Designate ie not a Secondary zone and that it exists. #. Process Pre-requisite section of request. **See RFC section 2.4 / 3.2** - For each ""update"" check that they are within the scope of 1 RecordSet for now. - See above on why 1 RecordSet pr update is allowed. - If the SOA is requested to be modified signal FORMERR. #. Check / Authenticate TSIG for the requested RR change depending on scope. (**See RFC section 3.3**) - TSIG is out of scope for this specification, will be outlined in later specification. # Perform the Update (**See RFC section 3.4 / 3.5**) #. Find the RecordSet in the database to get the ID. #. Update the found RecordSet.RecordList deleting / adding records as needed. #. Call central.update_recordset() to persist changes. # Return response of update operation (**See RFC section 3.7**) MiniDNS changes --------------- New method - handle_dynamic_update(update) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ A new method that handles most of the logic defined in the steps above.",,64,0

For example, a tenant who owns multiple domains should be able to add records in one domain while deleting in another domain. All of this manipulation should be either successful or rolled back together. At a minimum, this feature needs to work on a single domain where adding some records while deleting some records should be done with transaction support built in.

If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In other words, what's the scope of this effort? Include where in the designate tree hierarchy this will reside.

Problem description =================== For large zones, full zone transfers (AXFR) can take some time. In addition, if the zone changes frequently, slave servers can be spending a lot of time transferring full zones even if the change to the zone is small. This can keep Designate mDNS busy as well as the slave servers. Incremental zone transfers (IXFR) solve this problem by allowing slave servers to only transfer the records that change in the zone. Proposed change =============== The incremental zone transfer (IXFR) protocol is detailed in RFC 1995 and this document proposes Designate mDNS provides support for IXFR. With mDNS a zone transfer is triggered when a change is made to a zone and mDNS sends a NOTIFY message to a slave server or the SOA refresh timeout is exceeded on the slave server. In both cases, slave servers that support IXFR send a IXFR query containing the SOA record of the client to mDNS. The mDNS server ignores the SOA record in the IXFR query and responds with a AXFR message. What will happen with this change is mDNS will send either a AXFR or IXFR message, depending on which is shortest. To build the IXFR message, the SOA record sent by the client in the IXFR query will be used to determine the sequence of SOA records needed for the client to sync with Designate. The serial numbers in those SOA records will determine which add and delete records are needed in the IXFR response. mDNS Changes ------------ A new method in the RequestHandler class is needed to handle an IXFR query and generate an IXFR response: _handle_ixfr(context, request) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ +---------------+-------------------------------+--------------+ | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** | +===============+===============================+==============+ | *context* | Security context information. | Yes | +---------------+-------------------------------+--------------+ | *request* | The DNS request message. | Yes | +---------------+-------------------------------+--------------+ Return Value """""""""""""""""""""""" The DNS response message. Design Considerations """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" A valid IXFR response per RFC 1995 needs to be generated using the existing domains, recordsets, and records tables as well as the new domains_history, recordsets_history, and records_history tables. A modification to the RequestHandler class is needed to determine if the IXFR or AXFR response is shorter. Whichever is shorter will be used to respond to an IXFR query. Central Changes --------------- Every time a change is made to the domains, recordsets, or records tables, a new row needs to be added to the domains_history, recordsets_history, or records_history tables respectively. Storage Changes --------------- Three new tables for IXFR support will be needed. These tables will store the history of the domains, recordsets, and records table changes needed to generate the IXFR response.

For example, a tenant who owns multiple domains should be able to add records in one domain while deleting in another domain. All of this manipulation should be either successful or rolled back together. At a minimum, this feature needs to work on a single domain where adding some records while deleting some records should be done with transaction support built in.

To allow scalability for tens of thousands of tenants who has the private versions of their DNS zones, we need to let one pool manager service be able to manage all pools, and the private pools should be able to be created through REST API, in addition to static configurations in *designate.conf* file. Proposed change =============== We introduce a 'type' attribute in the pool object to distinguish a pool is for public or private versions of zones. Public pools are shared across different tenants. A private pool is dedicated to the tenant who creates it. A tenant can have at most one private pool and all private version zones would go to the dedicated private pool for that tenant. API Changes ----------- Pool object ^^^^^^^^^^^ +----------------+------------------------+----------------+---------+--------------------------+ | Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description | +================+========================+================+=========+==========================+ | type | ENUM(private, public) | Yes | None | Private or public pool | +----------------+------------------------+----------------+---------+--------------------------+ | targets | List | Yes | None | Pool Targets | +----------------+------------------------+----------------+---------+--------------------------+ | also_notifies | List | No | None | also-notify name servers | +----------------+------------------------+----------------+---------+--------------------------+ The *type* field is introduced to differentiate between public and private pools.

An alternative solution is to introduce a *neutron-dns-agent* to spawn bind9 or powerdns processes in separate network namespaces for separate tenant. In this case, there might be a scheduler to assign pool targets to different *neutron-dns-agent*. The *namesever* information can be derived from *neutron-dns-agent*. The *backend* and *ns_record* must be provided for a *target* to create a pool. The *options* field in *backend* is a collection of key-value pairs and different backend accepts various options, see as following table. +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | Type | Options | Description | +===========+=====================+=====================================================+ | bind9 | rndc_host | IP address of RNDC server. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | rndc_port | Port number of RNDC server. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | rndc_key_file | Path to RNDC key file. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | rndc_config_file | Path to RNDC config file. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | clean_zonefile | Whether to delete the zonefile when delete a zone. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | powerdns | connection | DB connection URL. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | agent | host | IP address. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | port | Port number. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | dynect | custome_name | Custome name. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | username | User name. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | password | Password. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | contact_nickname | Contact nickname. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | tsig_key_name | TSIG key name. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | akamai | username | User name. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | password | Password. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | tsig_key_name | TSIG key name. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | tsig_key_algorithm | TSIG key algorithm. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | tsig_key_secret | TSIG key secret. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | nsd4 | host | IP address. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | port | Port number. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | certfile | Path to certification file. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | keyfile | Path to key file. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | pattern | Zone pattern: master or slave. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | infoblox | wapi_url | Infoblox WAPI URL. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | username | User name. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | password | Password. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | ns_group | Name server group. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | sslverify | SSL verification. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | network_view | Network view. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | dns_view | DNS view. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | multi_tenant | Multi-tenant DNS view. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | designate | auth_url | Authentication URL. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | username | User name. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | password | Password. | +-----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+ | | tenant_name | Tenant name.

Pool manager changes -------------------- Pool manager topic ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Since we need one pool manager service to manage all pools, there is no need to append *pool_id* to pool manager RPC topic. All methods in pool manager RPC client that originally ends *pool_id* in the RPC topic would be changed to pass *pool_id* as one argument in the RPC method. Multiple pools ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The pool manager service is changed to be able to manage multiple pools. Pool manager service will add pool CRUD methods in its RPC endpoint, which are called by Central service. create_pool(self, context, pool) """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" +---------------+-----------------------------------------------+--------------+ | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** | +===============+===============================================+==============+ | *context* | Designate context | Yes | +---------------+-----------------------------------------------+--------------+ | *pool* | The created pool | Yes | +---------------+-----------------------------------------------+--------------+ After Central creates pool in storage, it calls this RPC method to pass the created pool to pool manager service.

Pool cache ^^^^^^^^^^ The pool manager service needs to create a pool cache to store all managed pools. *pool_id* is used as the key, and the combination of other fields in pool object are the value. Meanwhile, a *timeout* is associated with each pool cache entry. The pool manager service would pull the pool information from Central once the pool cache entry expired. Moreover, whenever pools are updated, the corresponding pool cache entry should be updated accordingly. Pool extension handlers ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Pool extension handlers will be introduced into pool manager service, which implement routines for the CRUD of pools and domains. Pool manager service loads pool extension handlers from configuration option *pool_extensions* in [service:pool_manager] section. .. code-block:: ini [service:pool_manager] pool_extensions = public, private The pool and domain CRUD methods in pool manager service will be changed as dispatchers, which passes the received RPC message to appropriate pool extension handler(s). The pool extension module will house a base extension, and two concrete extension handlers for public and private pools, respectively. Pool manager service will dispath its received RPC message to the routines in these two pool extension handlers based on the pool's type. The following methods would compose the base extension. create_pool(self, context, pool) """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" +---------------+-----------------------------------------------+--------------+ | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** | +===============+===============================================+==============+ | *context* | Designate context | Yes | +---------------+-----------------------------------------------+--------------+ | *pool* | The created pool | Yes | +---------------+-----------------------------------------------+--------------+ This method will do further handling for pool creation.

The blueprint is proposed to meet the needs of `dynamic pool management`_. .. _dynamic pool management: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/designate/+spec/dynamic-pools Proposed change =============== Config File Changes ------------------- As proposed in `dynamic pool management`_, the *pool target* is conceptually changed to be a high level abstraction of the combination of *backend*, *nameserver*, and *pool ns record*. Consequently, we only leave *backend* option under *[pool_target:<uuid>]* section. All other options originally configured under *[pool_target:<uuid>]* section are moved to be under *[backend:<uuid>]* section. Meanwhile, the original *options* under *[pool_target:<uuid>]* section is unpacked. The following shows an example. .. code-block:: ini [pool_target:f26e0b32-736f-4f0a-831b-039a415c481e] backend = f4734174-da67-4582-8e4d-afafd6d40d7f [backend:f4734174-da67-4582-8e4d-afafd6d40d7f] type = bind9 rndc_host = 192.168.27.100 rndc_port = 953 rndc_config_file = /etc/bind/rndc.conf rndc_key_file = /etc/bind/rndc.key clean_zonefile = false #masters = 192.168.28.100:53 The MiniDNS address will be automatically added into *masters* if the *masters* option is not explicitly configured for the backend.

If you have nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html To test out your formatting, see http://www.tele3.cz/jbar/rest/rest.html ================================= Exposing Inherited Recordset TTLs ================================= Currently Recordsets that don't have a specific TTL set on them report their TTL as ""NULL"" when in fact, the TTL is inherited from the zone. A ""NULL"" TTL doesn't really make sense, so we should figure out a way to show users that the TTL is actually from the zone. Proposed change =============== There are a few ways to address the issue. Ordered by increasing amount of work. Documentation Only ------------------ We could make a simple documentation change to note the current state of how the TTL works, that it is inherited from the zone, unless otherwise set. This is obviously straightforward, but people who don't read the docs closely will still be confused. Show Inherited TTL Opaquely --------------------------- The TTL field on Recordsets could be populated in the API with the zone TTL unless the Recordset has had an explicit TTL set. This satisfies the desire to see the TTL in the API, but could result in unexpected changes for a user if they didn't read the associated docuemntation and changed their zone TTL. Set a Default Recordset TTL --------------------------- The TTL field for Recordsets could be set via configuration value, and only be overridden by users, so in this case, it would no longer inherit from the zone. The default could be clearly documented, and should be somewhat simple to understand, even if it doesn't make a lot of sense to those who understand DNS. Show an inherited_ttl field --------------------------- Create a new API field that shows an ``inherited_ttl`` equal to the zone TTL if no explicit TTL has been set. The value would be present, and would take effect if no TTL had been set. Once a TTL has been set on the Recordset, the inherited ttl would probably still be shown. This involves an API change. Recordsets would now have an ``inherited_ttl`` field that would be immutable, except by changing the zone TTL.

Designate should have this feature where records are created in tenant domains so that tenants can make changes to the records created by Designate Sink if required. Problem description =================== Desigante Sink create DNS A records in a predefined domain. Tenant doesn't have access to these records and can never access them even if he needs to update them. Proposed change =============== Right now designate-sink handlers in designate.conf has hard coded domain_id. We can change this to %(domain) so that base.py can look for a domain matching the default domain convention in designate.conf and create records in that domain. If domain doesn't exist then create the domain following the domain convention in designate.conf Sink Changes =============== nova.py and neutron.py needs to be updated so that tenant's domain for sink is considered. If there is no domain for the tenant then create the default domain. NotificationHandler of base.py needs to be updated with create_domain method which will add the domain for the tenant. API Changes =========== No Changes to the API. Storage Chages ============== No Changes. Alternatives ============ Alternatively domain_id in designate.conf can be hard coded to zone/domainid so that all records created by designate-sink endup in one common domain. Implementation ============== Update designate.conf.sample to refelect the default domain convention under nova_fixed and neutron_floatingip. base.py to check if default domain is already present else create it. If domain_format is empty then look for domain_id and consider that domain. If either of domain_format or domain_id are empty then sink will consider hardcoded domain_format in nova.py and neutron.py respectively.

In python 3, range() does what xrange() used to do and xrange() does not
exist. If you want to write code that will run on both Python 2 and
Python 3, you can't use xrange().

range() can actually be faster in some cases - eg. if iterating over the
same sequence multiple times. xrange() has to reconstruct the integer
object every time, but range() will have real integer objects.
(It will always perform worse in terms of memory however)

xrange() isn't usable in all cases where a real list is needed.

The goal is to find a better place for the transaction decorator and
adjust the implementation to allow disabling the decorator. This will
allow testing transactional methods in isolation without having to mock
out all the code that tests retries and handles transactions.

Here is an example of disabling the transaction:

   @mock.patch('designate.storage.transaction.ENABLE_TRANSACTION', False)
   def test_method_in_isolation(self):
       assert self.central_api.create_zone()

You can also explicitly enable or disable the use of a transaction or
the retries.

LBaaS v1 support was removed in Newton release, but there are
still users of LBaaS v1 API. It looks reasonable to maintain it
with minimum effort rather than dropping it.
This commit fixes LBaaS v1 API document with rough checks.

Note that project_id field is not listed in LBaaS v1 API intentionally
as project_id field was added in Newton release.

As of Libvirt 1.3.3 (`commit`_) and later Libvirt no longer accepts an empty path attribute to the script element of the interface. Notably this includes Libvirt 2.0.0 as provided with RHEL 7.3 and CentOS 7.3-1611. The creation of virtual machines with offending interface definitions on a host with Libvirt 1.3.3 or later will result in an error ""libvirtError: Cannot find '' in path: No such file or directory"". Additionally, where virtual machines already exist that were created using earlier versions of Libvirt interactions with these virtual machines via Nova or other utilities (e.g. `virsh`) may result in similar errors. To mitigate this issue Nova no longer generates an empty path attribute to the script element when defining an interface. This resolves the issue with regards to virtual machine creation. To resolve the issue with regards to existing virtual machines a change to Libvirt is required, this is being tracked in `Bugzilla 1412834`_ .. _commit: https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=9c17d665fdc5f0ab74500a14c30627014c11b2c0 .. _Bugzilla 1412834: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1412834 ",,31,4

When a new K8s resource (e.g. pod) is created, a series of events are
triggered. The current flow is as follows:
  1. events A and B happen in a short succession; neither of them
     contain Kuryr-related annotation
  2. Kuryr handles event A, creates necessary Neutron resources and
     adds an annotation, which triggers another event C
  3. Kuryr then handles event B, but since the annotations added in
     previous step are not yet available in event B, Kuryr is not
     aware of already created Neutron resources

This patch introduces a workaround that allows to skip events that
happen in short 'bursts' so handlers will only receive the latest
event. A more robust solution will be added in a later patch.

We're already a handoff - just wait until we can ship it to the right
primary location.

If we timeout talking to a couple of nodes (or more likely get rejected
for connection limits because of contention during a rebalance) we can
actually end up making *more* work if we move the part to another node.
I've seen clusters get stuck on rebalance just passing parts around
handoffs for *days*.

Known-Issues:

If we see a 507 from a primary and we're not in the handoff list (we're
an old primary post rebalance) it'd probably be not so terrible to try
to revert it to the first handoff if it's not already holding a part.
But that's more work and sounds more like lp bug #1510342

Closes-Bug: #1653169

In current implementation, the 'rebuild' operation is implemented in a

so special and leaving no room for other actions to be handled.

This patch changes the 'do_rebuild' into 'handle_rebuild', which is an

There should be some way to retrieve such notifications and process them to completion. :solution: Add a periodic task “process_unfinished_notifications’ which will execute at regular interval as defined by the new config option “process_unfinished_notifications_interval” in seconds. Default value for this option will be 300 seconds, however operator can set this interval value as per the requirement. Inside this periodic task, it will retrieve all notifications which are in ‘error’ or ‘new’ status and then execute recovery action workflow to process all of them. The notifications which are in ‘new’ status will be picked up based on a new config option ‘retry_notification_new_status_interval’. Default value for this option will be 600 seconds, however operator can set this interval value as per the requirement. Each notification has ‘generated_time’ field, if this time + retry_notification_new_status_interval value (in seconds) is greater than or equal to the current system time, then all such notifications in ‘new’ status will be picked up by this periodic task. Also, the notifications in ‘error’ status will be picked up too. Let’s understand the transition state of notification for different statuses for success case: notification current status error -> running -> finished notification current status new-> running -> finished If the workflow execution fails, then the transition state of notification would be: notification current status error -> running -> failed notification current status new-> running -> failed Note: One important point to take note of is if the original notification status is ‘new’ then it won’t be retried again if the workflow fails to process it in the periodic task. It’s status will be directly set to ‘failed’. The operator needs to take corrective action for all notifications which are in ‘failed‘ state manually. :alternatives: Add two periodic tasks ‘process_error_notifications’ and ‘process_queued_notifications’ to process notifications which are in ‘error’ and ‘new’ status respectively. These periodic tasks will be called at regular intervals as defined by two new config options “process_error_notification_interval’ and ‘process_queued_notifications_interval’. The logic for retrieval of notifications which are in ‘error’ and ‘new’ statuses will be exactly same as above solution. The only difference would be in the notification status upon its completion as explained below. Transition state of notification for different statuses for success case. notification current status error (process_error_notifications) -> running -> finished notification current status new (process_queued_notifications) -> running -> finished If the workflow execution fails, then the transition state of notification would be: notification current status error (process_error_notifications) -> running -> failed notification current status new (process_queued_notifications) -> running -> error This means that the notification will be again eligible for reprocessing during the next cycle of ‘process_error_notifications’ periodic task. :impacts: None :timeline: Expected to be merged within the Ocata time frame. :reviewers: sam47priya@gmail.com, kajinamit@nttdata.co.jp, tushar.vitthal.patil@gmail.com :assignee: Abhishek Kekane End of Add periodic task to clean up workflow failure +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ",,122,0

While debugging the related bug, this showed up in the logs:
AddBridgeCommand(datapath_type=None, may_exist=system, name=test-brd8f3648c)

This was caused by the add_bridge command not passing in the datapath
type as named argument so it was taking the positional argument of
may_exist. So the datapath type was being lost whenever this command
was being used.

This fixes it by makeing add_bridge use a named argument for
datapath_type and it also switches it to using the
OVSBridge.create() method to unify the code-paths for bridge
creation.

It's not clear that this was a cause of the bug though, so
this fix is only related.

Tools to help run CI jobs for TripleO.

This commit switching tasks resolution approach to the tags based one.
Tag - minimal unit what's necessary only for task resolution and can be
mapped to the node through the role interface only. Each role provides set
of tags in its 'tags' field and may be modified via role API. Tag may be
created separately via tag API, but, this tag can not be used unless it's

DevStack removed support for specifying a Keystone catalog backend other
than sql in commit 985e958dda3e843442f76199caf63fa8b93680cc. However,
the variable KEYSTONE_CATALOG_BACKEND was still set, which meant the
blazar service and endpoint were still being created.

This variable was removed in fb73d85afe7df7b93b9a460372a8ad6558e887e0
which results in our DevStack plugin not creating the blazar service and
endpoint anymore.

Create service and endpoint unconditionally instead.

Note that the code creating a Keystone v3 service and endpoint is kept
even though Keystone v3 is now the default in DevStack. This is because
the Keystone endpoint in DevStack is now unversioned, which is not yet
supported by Blazar. We need Keystone v3 to use trusts.

The 'visibility' values for an image have been expanded to include 'community' and 'shared'. features: - | Image 'visibility' changes * Prior to Ocata, an image with 'private' visibility could become shared by adding members to it, though its visibility remained 'private'. In order to make the visibility of images more clear, in Ocata the following changes are introduced: - A new value for visibility, 'shared', is introduced. Images that have or can accept members will no longer be displayed as having 'private' visibility, reducing confusion among end users. - An image must have 'shared' visibility in order to accept members. This provides a safeguard from 'private' images being shared inadvertently. - In order to preserve backward compatibilty with the current sharing workflow, the default visibility of an image in Ocata is 'shared'. Consistent with pre-Ocata behavior, this will allow the image to accept member operations without first updating the visibility of the image. (Keep in mind that an image with visibility 'shared' but having no members is not actually accessible to anyone other than the image owner, so this is not in itself a security problem.) - | Image visibility may be specified at the time of image creation * As mentioned above, the default visibility of an image is 'shared'. If a user wants an image to be private and not accept any members, a visibility of 'private' can be explicitly assigned at the time of creation. - Such an image will require its visibility to be updated to 'shared' before it will accept members. - | Image visibility is changed using the current image update (PATCH) call. - | A new value for the Image 'visibility' field, 'community', is introduced. * An image with 'community' visibility is accessible to any user. * In order to prevent users spamming other users' image-list response, community images are not included in the image-list response unless specifically requested by a user - for example, ``GET v2/images?visibility=community`` - As is standard behavior for the image-list call, other filters may be applied to the request. For example, to see the community images supplied by user ``931efe8a-0ad7-4610-9116-c199f8807cda``, the following call would be made: ``GET v2/images?visibility=community&owner=931efe8a-0ad7-4610-9116-c199f8807cda`` upgrade: - | A new value for the Image 'visibility' field, 'community', is introduced. * The ability to update an image to have 'community' visibility is governed by a policy target named 'communitize_image'. The default is empty, that is, any user may communitize an image. - | Visibility migration of current images * Prior to Ocata, the Glance database did not have a 'visibility' column, but instead used a boolean 'is_public' column, which was translated into 'public' or 'private' visibility in the Images API v2 image response. As part of the upgrade to Ocata, a 'visibility' column is introduced into the images table. It will be populated as follows - All images currently with 'public' visibility (that is, images for which 'is_public' is True in the database) will have their visibility set to 'public'. - Images currently with 'private' visibility (that is, images for which 'is_public' is False in the database) **and** that have image members, will have their visibility set to 'shared'. - Those images currently with 'private' visibility (that is, images for which 'is_public' is False in the database) and that have **no** image members, will have their visibility set to 'private'. * Note that such images will have to have their visibility updated to 'shared' before they will accept members. other: - | The image visibility changes described herein do not apply to the DEPRECATED Images API v1, which does not have a concept of ""visibility"".

This patch adds tests for the `func_rhel6` tox environment in the
openstack-ansible-security role. The test environment should only
be run against Ubuntu Trusty.

The patch removes the gating for the `func_rhel7` tox environment
since those tests have moved under the `functional` environment within
the role.

This reverts commit b577ae03f173ebb9ec7af84ec56ca6ce67b467b7.

This change unexpectedly added -ubuntu-trusty job in the master
integrated gate (and probably removed it from other branches). What we
need to do is to run it in devstack master AND in integrated gate for
Mitaka. I am not sure how to achieve that, so in the meantime, I revert
the patch.

Domain specific roles have a main limitation: they are not considered an
""effective"" role assignment, which means a user can't authenticate
using such assignment.

This also means that, although we can create cross domain implied roles,
this doesn't bypass the assignments isolation due the condition above.

This patch adds a test to enforce this behavior.

The function delete_volume is unaware of migration. The volume object
sent down to delete_volume from retype with migration is a mix of the new

doesn't validate provider_id to ensure it is for the current back end.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Limit Concurrent Actions ========================================== Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/watcher/+spec/limit-concurrent-actions This spec proposes a capability that limits the number of concurrent actions that can be in flight when a particular audit is invoked. Problem description =================== The problem solved by this spec is that there is currently no way to limit the amount of stress that Watcher can potentially impose on a data center. For example, Watcher could decide to invoke 50 parallel live migration operations during an optimization cycle, which could negatively impact the network's throughput. As such, we need a way to cap these types of operations. Use Cases ---------- 1. As a cloud operator, I want to specify the maximum number of concurrent actions that can be running in parallel, so that I can control the amount of stress that Watcher may put on my infrastructure as it optimizes. Project Priority ----------------- No. Proposed change =============== This blueprint adds the capability to specify the maximum number of actions that can be running concurrently. Specifically, this will introduce a new attribute (max_concurrent_actions) that will be represented as a list of strings that specify various maximum values; this attribute will be associated with the **AuditTemplate** and **Audit** structures and will be structured in the following way: [qualifier-1=value-1, qualifier-2=value-2]. While more qualifiers may be added over time, this blueprint will introduce support for the following qualifiers: * **max.actions** Specifies the maximum number of concurrent actions that Watcher can invoke. * **max.actions.migration.live** Specifies the maximum number of concurrent live migrations that Watcher can invoke. Alternatives ------------ None. Data model impact ----------------- The following data objects will be impacted: * **AuditTemplate**: * We should be able to store in the database the limit defined as an array of values with imposed restrictions (e.g., [max.actions.migration.live=5] or [max.actions=15]). * **Audit**: * We should be able to store in the database the limit defined as an array of values with imposed restrictions (e.g., [max.actions.migration.live=5, max.actions.migration.cold=5] or [max.actions=15]). REST API impact --------------- There are small changes necessary for the **Audit** and **AuditTemplate** APIs. Specifically, this blueprint will allow the max-concurrent-actions data to be created, updated and read (POST, PUT and GET, respectively). Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- The *python-watcherclient* will be enhanced to allow the max-concurrent-actions to be specified when creating an **AuditTemplate** or an **Audit**. It will also be enhanced to display this value as well when listing the respective structures. Performance Impact ------------------ This feature will not add operational performance overhead to the Watcher system itself. It will however provide the potential to positively affect the performance of the overall data center in which Watcher is running as a cloud administrator will have the capability to limit the number of concurrent operations that are invoked by Watcher, thereby reducing the overall load put on the user's cloud. Other deployer impact --------------------- By default, Watcher will allow up to 10 concurrent actions to be performed in parallel (i.e., if no max-concurrent-actions are specified). If the administrator wants to change the default behavior, they can update the respective audit template to meet their needs. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: None Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- This spec should be able to be implemented in a single feature commit that limits the Watcher system's overall concurrency. Dependencies ============ The following blueprint needs to be implemented first (i.e., because the current planner does not schedule concurrent actions): * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/watcher/+spec/planner-storage-action-plan Testing ======= Both unit tests and tempest tests should be provided for this spec. Namely, the tests should simulate various upper bounds in terms of the max degree of parallelism requested. Documentation Impact ==================== None. References ========== None. History ======= None. ",,182,0

    showing the stack, resolving the outputs is just incurring a
    pointless processing hit on the server (ultimately heat-engine)
    and delaying a response to the client.

  * Whether we --wait or or not, we only show ""short"" stack info which
    doesn't include outputs anyway. So, let's avoid the
    processing/time overhead of resolving the outputs. (In theory,
    with --wait we might want to show ""long"" output with stack outputs
    afterwards, but that would be additional functionality that should
    be handled in a different patch)

* Add the --no-resolve-outputs option to ""stack show"" which already
  exists in the legacy heat stack-show command.

Adding constraints support to libraries is slightly more complex than
services as the libraries themselves are listed in upper-constraints.txt
which leads to errors that you can't install a specific version and a
constrained version.

This change adds constraints support by also adding a helper script to

Adding constraints support to libraries is slightly more complex than
services as the libraries themselves are listed in upper-constraints.txt

This change adds constraints support by also adding a helper script to

This moves all nova constraints into puppet-tripleo.

Furthermore it introduces a new define to ease the declaration of the
constraints which will avoid hard to debug bugs like the one this patch
relates to.

It also adds the necessary structure to make spec on define.

Furthermore, when the refactoring of services will happen this will make
it easier to remove/adjust them.

Eventually, this really help a lot for the refactor related to the new
resource in the pacemaker module.

As part of the breaking up of Access and Security, move the Key Pairs
tab to a new panel under Compute. Separate patches will address Floating
IPs, Security Groups, and API Access.

Fixes include:
- Should be significantly faster to access Key Pairs, as we are no
longer running multiple API calls for the other Access & Security tabs
at the same time. Hooray for speed!
- Should be easier for new users to find where Key Pairs are located.
- Reduce reuse of identical translatable strings
- Use common templates instead of duplication
- Updated policy rules and added missing rules to table get_data
- Small cleanup of the Key Pair download page, which was previously
using modal classes despite not being a modal.

New way of validation of QoS policy can be applied on port/network based on
port_types. It can validate if port can support rule by rule_type and also by
rule parameters or some values of parameters.

In ML2 core plugin it base on vif_type and/or vnic type for unbound
ports. For example bandwidth_limit_rule can have parameter ""direction"" with
possible values ""ingress"" and ""egress"". Some of mechanism drivers can support
only one of those directions.

If user will try to apply policy with rule unsupported by port_type then it
will get error message and policy will not be applied.
Such validation is made during:
* port create
* port update
* network update
* QoS rule create
* QoS rule update

CentOS 7 systems have firewalld installed and running by default. It's

neutron and some LXC networking.

This patch stops firewalld, masks the systemd unit, and then clears

Various tests were modelling the return of blockJobInfo rather than
mocking guest.BlockDevice.is_job_complete. While I'm generally very
much in favour of this kind of functional testing, distributing it
throughout individual tests is not maintainable. If we're going to do
this we need to maintain a minimal simulation library, which we don't

This change updates all tests which use the return of blockJobInfo to

fix is_job_complete without breaking a large number of tests.

With newer keystone middleware tenant* isn't set, project* is. The
current neutron logic assumes tenant is the good values, and that
project should mirror it, but that logic actually needs to be
inverted.

In order to minimally impact unit tests as operations, the strategy
here is to just prefer project_name, but fall back to tenant_name if
project_name isn't filled out (this should basically never be the
case).

With this project_name shows up in the context log lines in devstack
again (it's been missing for some time).

equivalent functionality:
- don't have ability to access panko via client.
- don't have tempest check to ensure ceilometer pushes to panko
- don't have tempest in panko but had it in ceilometer

Support for CDH 5.9 in scenario tests. Less parameters required for scenario tests. features: - The Tempest-based tests have received an increase of the coverage for both API and CLI tests (job, plugins, templates; negative testing). - CDH 5.9 can be tested thanks to the addition of the specific templates. - Few parameters are not required anymore by the templates in scenario tests; a default value is provided (name of templates, etc). - The flavors used in templates are now parameters too. - If a flavor name is provided in addition to its specification and a flavor with that name exists, it is used and not created again. - The dependencies on non-public Tempest interfaces have been removed. upgrade: - the name of the variables/parameters used for the name of the images in the scenario tests have been changes to follow a more consistent pattern. critical: - The Tempest plugin was fixed after the removal of the data_processing plugin from the tempest repository. Most of the work was in place, only a small change was missing. fixes: - The artifacts created during the execution of CLI tests are properly cleaned at the end of the tests. other: - The documentation was improved (scenario tests) and extended (Tempest plugin).

The NFS implementation based off cinder_nfs_client
does not support per cinder backend configuration,
separating NFS mounts per backend.
This fix removes cinder_nfs_client in favor of
fully supporting multi cinder backends over the

Releasenote translation publishing is being prepared. 'locale_dirs'
needs to be defined in conf.py to generate translated version of the
release notes.

Note that this repository might not get translated release notes - or
no translations at all - but we add the entry here nevertheless to
prepare for it.

test.idempotent_id is being kept temporary to migrate
to new lib interface. Now idempotent_id is available as Tempest stable
interface decorators and all plugins tests using the old decorator
should be switched to new interface.

In future, Once all plugins are switched to new decorator Tempest
will remove the test.idempotent_id

This commit correct the example tests in doc.

This code can be simplified and made more modular. Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+spec/example The current IP generation code is tightly couple to the configuration loading, writing, and inventory manipulation code. To help provide better, more focused test coverage, this code can be updated and replaced. Problem description =================== The current IP generation code is difficult to maintain, despite mostly being `moved <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/392277/>` into a separate ``ip.py`` module. The code uses the external ``Queue`` class, which is slightly more complex than necessary. The ``USED_IPS`` set and the pools of available IPs are not managed together, and could easily become out-of-sync. New code has been written to add an `IPManager class`_, but it is not currently integrated into any other code. Such integration is a somewhat large task, and would be error-prone to do in a single review. This spec is intended to serve as a road map to guide small, focused changes towards using it. Note that while the IPManager includes an API for external IPAM systems, this spec is only focused on using this class within the code, not on any sort of plugin system. Proposed change =============== An initial draft of new IP management code has been written in the `IPManager class`_. After that, the existing ``get_ip_address``, and ``set_used_ips`` were refactored to still use the existing data structures, but in a way that would allow usage of the new IPManager class. See `review 403915`_. Some refactors may be necessary for the IPManager class to facilitate this and further codify assumptions. Alternatives ------------ The code be left as is, with the assumption that it will be replaced wholesale by some other system in the near future. That replacement might happen via plugins or a new inventory codebase. This has not been deeply explored in the context of the IP management/generation. One such replacement system, for example, could be using LXD to entirely manage container creation, which is where IP generation is primarily used. Playbook/Role impact -------------------- No noticeable impact on the playbooks and roles should be seen; this is largely facilitating code maintenance and should produce the same output. Upgrade impact -------------- There should be no upgrade impact - the IPManager class should be loaded with the already-generated IP addresses in upgraded installations. Security impact --------------- This change should not affect any sensitive data. It is unrelated to secret storage. Performance impact ------------------ Generating IPs may be slightly faster, since this approach doesn't rely on delayed access from ``Queue`` objects. However, the overall runtime of the inventory is negligible in the overall speed of the system and hasn't been profiled. End user impact --------------- This change would be invisible to users of the deployed cloud. Deployer impact --------------- No configuration or output changes should be introduced. The current configurations should be used as-is. Developer impact ---------------- This should improve quality of life for developers debugging the IP generation behavior. Dependencies ------------ This has no direct dependencies on other blueprints or specs. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: nolan-brubaker, IRC: palendae Other contributors: steve-lewis, IRC: stevelle Please add **IRC nicknames** where applicable. Work items ---------- * Refactor current IP loading/management functions to be amenable to replacing the data structures. * Replace the data structures and update the objects being passed between functions. Testing ======= Unit and integration tests should be added for all code changes to confirm there are no regressions. Documentation impact ==================== Developer documentation should be updated to reflect the new mechanism used, preferably included with implementation patches.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================== Fix tag attribute disappearing ============================== Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/fix-tag-attribute-disappearing In the context of virtual device role tagging at instance boot time, a bug [1] has caused the tag attribute to no longer be accepted starting with version 2.33 for block_device_mapping_v2 and starting with version 2.37 for networks. In other words, block devices can only be tagged in 2.32 and network interfaces between 2.32 and 2.36 inclusively. This spec introduces a new API microversion that re-adds the tag attribute to both block_device_mapping_v2 and networks. Problem description =================== For block_device_mapping_v2, the problem stems from the use of the equality comparison in [2]. It causes the Nova API to accept the tag attribute only in microversion 2.32. The intent was of course to support tags in all versions greater than or equal to 2.32, but the implementation mistake was missed both by the author and the reviewers. In the case of networks, microversion 2.37 introduced a new choice for the network item in the instance boot request body [3]. In addition to the previously allowed dictionary containing one of port, uuid or fixed_ip, a new string item - either 'auto' or 'none' - became accepted. When writing the schema for this change, the previous schema had to be copied and included as one of the two choices. It is this copying that introduced the error: the tag item was not copied along with the rest of the schema. Use Cases --------- As an end user, I want block device role tagging to continue working beyond microversion 2.32. As an end user, I want network interface role tagging to continue working beyond microversion 2.37. Proposed change =============== This spec proposes to document the bug in api-ref and reno while at the same time reintroducing the tag attribute to both block_device_mapping_v2 and networks in a new API microversion. In order to prevent future bugs of the same kind, the API microversion will be passed to API extension as an APIVersionRequest object. While this will not prevent the use of APIVersionRequest's __eq__ operator, it will at least prevent direct comparisons to strings (such as version == '2.32') and will encourage the use of APIVersionRequest's matches() method for all microversion comparisons. One of the reasons the original bug was missed is that functional tests are only run on the specific microversion they are concerned with. That is, the tests for 2.32 are only run against 2.32. While having every test class for a new microversion inherit from the test class for the previous microversion (for example, ServersSampleJson232Test inheriting from ServersSampleJson231Test) is wasteful, this spec proposes to run all of the API samples tests against 2.latest. This will ensure no accidental breakage at any single point in the microversion timeline. Alternatives ------------ Because the tag attribute needs to be reintroduced to the API, a new microversion is necessary, as per Nova project policy. There are therefore no alternatives. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- This spec impacts only the body of the POST /servers method. The tag attribute is re-added to the networks and block_device_mapping_v2 items. Networks example:: { ""server"": { ""name"": ""nic-tagging"", ""imageRef"": ""70a599e0-31e7-49b7-b260-868f441e862b"", ""flavorRef"": ""http://openstack.example.com/flavors/1"", ""networks"": { ""uuid"": ""a0ef4e02-9150-418c-b4cf-cf4a86e92bf1"", ""tag"": ""nic1"" } } } Block device mapping example:: { ""server"": { ""name"": ""nic-tagging"", ""imageRef"": ""70a599e0-31e7-49b7-b260-868f441e862b"", ""flavorRef"": ""http://openstack.example.com/flavors/1"", ""block_device_mapping_v2"": [{ ""boot_index"": ""0"", ""uuid"": ""ac408821-c95a-448f-9292-73986c790911"", ""source_type"": ""image"", ""volume_size"": ""25"", ""destination_type"": ""volume"", ""delete_on_termination"": true, ""tag"": ""disk1"" }] } } Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- Python-novaclient will be updated to work with the disappearance of the tag attribute in 2.33 and 2.37. It will also be updated to use the new microversion that reintroduces the tag attribute. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Artom Lifshitz (notartom) Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Implement a new API microversion that reintroduces the tag attribute to networks and block_device_mapping_v2. * When calling extensions, pass the version as an APIVersionRequest object instead of a string. * Run all API samples tests against 2.latest, except where an API feature has been removed. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= A functional test will be added for the new API microversion. The existing Tempest test will be modified to test all microverions that support device tagging at instance boot time. Documentation Impact ==================== The API reference will be updated to document the bug as well as the new API microversion. Release notes will do the same.

While this has worked, it is not very robust. In order to accomodate for more deployer flexibility, the inventory system should be reworked to use a pluggable system for storing necessary info. A filesystem plugin would provide backwards compatibility, and a Craton plugin will also be developed. * The filename in the git repository should match the launchpad URL, for example a URL of: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+spec/awesome-thing should be named awesome-thing.rst Problem description =================== A detailed description of the problem: * For a new feature this might be use cases. Ensure you are clear about the actors in each use case: End User vs Deployer. * For a major reworking of something existing it would describe the problems in that feature that are being addressed. Proposed change =============== Provide an overview of the changes you'd like to see implemented. Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How do you propose to solve this problem? Notable changes: * list out all of the notable changes. If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In other words, what's the scope of this effort? Alternatives ------------ What, if any, are the alternatives to the changes you are proposing? What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one. Playbook/Role impact -------------------- What impact will there be on the playbooks? Upgrade impact -------------- If this change set concerns any kind of upgrade process, describe how it is supposed to deal with that stuff. For example, if containers are removed and or have their specific purpose changed how do you indend to deal with the eventual upgrade from the prospective of an existing installation? Does this change require documentation to be fully supported or will there be specific tooling that has to be created in order for the upgrade to be completed? Security impact --------------- Describe any potential security impact on the system. Some of the items to consider include: * Does this change touch sensitive data such as tokens, keys, or user data? * Does this change alter a deployed OpenStack API in a way that may impact security, such as a new way to access sensitive information or a new way to login? * Does this change involve cryptography or hashing? * Does this change require the use of sudo or any elevated privileges? * Does this change involve using or parsing user-provided data? This could be directly at the API level or indirectly such as changes to a cache layer. For more detailed guidance, please see the OpenStack Security Guidelines as a reference (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/Guidelines). These guidelines are a work in progress and are designed to help you identify security best practices. For further information, feel free to reach out to the OpenStack Security Group at openstack-security@lists.openstack.org. Performance impact ------------------ Describe any potential performance impact on the system. For example, how is the code executed and does it depend on upstream resources that may be unavailable? Examples of things to consider here include: * Adding a new PPA for upgraded packages, who is the maintainer? Does this individual push often? How long has this individual/company maintain specific packages? * Adding additional pinned packages for use in a python wheel. Does this package change often? Are there tests? End user impact --------------- How would the end user be impacted by this change? The ""End User"" is defined as the users of the deployed cloud? Deployer impact --------------- How would the deployer be impacted by this change? Discuss things that will affect how OpenStack will be deployed, such as: * What config options are being added? Should they be more generic than proposed? Are the default values ones which will work well in real deployments? * Is this a change that takes immediate effect after its merged, or is it something that has to be explicitly enabled? * If this change is a new binary, how would it be deployed? * Please state anything that those doing continuous deployment, or those upgrading from the previous release, need to be aware of. Also describe any plans to deprecate configuration values or features. For example, if we change the name of a play, how do we handle deployments before the change landed? Do we have a special case in the code? Do we assume that the operator will recreate containers within the infrastructure of the cloud? Does this effect running instances within the cloud? Developer impact ---------------- How does this change impact future developers working on the ansible playbooks? Discuss things that will affect other developers working on OS-Ansible-Deployment, such as: * If this spec proposes a new role, how will that role be deployed? Is this a new default role? Does this role have a host impact? Dependencies ------------ Does this blueprint/spec depend one another blueprint or spec? * Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in os-ansible-deployment, or in other projects, that this one either depends on or is related to. * Is the new requirement due to an upstream change? If so document it and provide references to the change. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: <launchpad-id or None> Other contributors: <launchpad-id or None> Please add **IRC nicknames** where applicable. Work items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Testing ======= Please discuss how the change will be tested. You should be able to answer the following questions: * Does this change impact how gating is done? * Can this change be tested on a **per-commit** basis? * Given the instance size restrictions, as found in OpenStack Infra (8GB Ram, vCPUs <= 8), can the test be run in a resource constrained environment? * Is this untestable given current limitations (specific hardware / software configurations available)? If so, are there mitigation plans for this change to be tested within 3rd party testing, gate enhancements, etc...? * If the service is not OpenStack specific how can we test the change? Documentation impact ==================== What is the impact on the docs team of this change? Some changes might require donating resources to the docs team to have the documentation updated. Don't repeat details discussed above, but please reference them here. References ========== Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any reference. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are: * Links to mailing list or IRC discussions * Links to relevant research, if appropriate * Related specifications as appropriate * Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to ",,246,0

In order to successfully monitor this and use it to diagnose problems, the standard ""ssh and grep"" solution quickly becomes unmanageable. Kolla can deploy Kibana as part of the E*K stack in order to allow operators to search and visualise logs in a centralised manner. Preparation and deployment ========================== Modify the configuration file ``/etc/kolla/globals.yml`` and change the following: :: enable_central_logging: ""yes"" After successful deployment, Kibana can be accessed using a browser on ``<kolla_external_vip_address>:5601``. The default username is ``kibana``, the password can be located under ``<kibana_password>`` in ``/etc/kolla/passwords.yml``.pattern. To view, analyse and search logs, at least one index pattern has to be created. To match indices stored in ElasticSearch, we suggest setting the ""Index name or pattern"" field to ``log-*``. The rest of the fields can be left as is. After setting parameters, create an index by clicking the ``Create`` button.Operators can create and store searches based on various fields from logs, for example, ""show all logs marked with ERROR on nova-compute"". To do this, click the ``Discover`` tab. Fields from the logs can be filtered by hovering over entries from the left hand side, and clicking ``add`` or ``remove``. Add the following fields: * Hostname * Payload * severity_label * programname This yields an easy to read list of all log events from each node in the deployment within the last 15 minutes. A ""tail like"" functionality can be achieved by clicking the clock icon in the top right hand corner of the screen, and selecting ``Auto-refresh``. Logs can also be filtered down further. To use the above example, type ``programname:nova-compute`` in the search bar. Click the drop-down arrow from one of the results, then the small magnifying glass icon from beside the programname field. This should now show a list of all events from nova-compute services across the cluster. The current search can also be saved by clicking the ``Save Search`` icon available from the menu on the right hand side. Example: using Kibana to diagnose a common failure -------------------------------------------------- The following example demonstrates how Kibana can be used to diagnose a common OpenStack problem, where an instance fails to launch with the error 'No valid host was found'. First, re-run the server creation with ``--debug``: :: openstack --debug server create --image cirros --flavor m1.tiny \ --key-name mykey --nic net-id=00af016f-dffe-4e3c-a9b8-ec52ccd8ea65 \ demo1 In this output, look for the key ``X-Compute-Request-Id``. This is a unique identifier that can be used to track the request through the system. An example ID looks like this: :: X-Compute-Request-Id: req-c076b50a-6a22-48bf-8810-b9f41176a6d5 Taking the value of ``X-Compute-Request-Id``, enter the value into the Kibana search bar, minus the leading ``req-``. Assuming some basic filters have been added as shown in the previous section, Kibana should now show the path this request made through the OpenStack deployment, starting at a ``nova-api`` on a control node, through the ``nova-scheduler``, ``nova-conductor``, and finally ``nova-compute``. Inspecting the ``Payload`` of the entries marked ``ERROR`` should quickly lead to the source of the problem. While some knowledge is still required of how Nova works in this instance, it can still be seen how Kibana helps in tracing this data, particularly in a large scale deployment scenario.","Default index pattern ===================== After successful Kibana deployment, it can be accessed on <kolla_internal_vip_address>:<kibana_server_port> or <kolla_external_vip_address>:<kibana_server_port> in any web browser after authenticating with ``<kibana_user>`` and ``<kibana_password>``. The values ``<kolla_internal_vip_address>``, ``<kolla_external_vip_address>``, ``<kibana_server_port>`` and ``<kibana_user>`` can be found in ``<kolla_install_path>/kolla/ansible/group_vars/all.yml`` or if the default values are overridden, in ``/etc/kolla/globals.yml``. The value ``<kibana_password>`` can be found in ``/etc/kolla/passwords.yml``. By default kibana_server_port is set to 5601.pattern. To view, analyse and search logs, at least one index pattern has to be created. To match indices stored in ElasticSearch, we suggest to use following configuration: #. Index contains time-based events - check #. Use event times to create index names [DEPRECATED] - not checked #. Index name or pattern - log-* #. Do not expand index pattern when searching (Not recommended) - not checked #. Time-field name - Timestamp After setting parameters, one can create an index with *Create* button.Logs search is available under Discover tab. In the menu on the left side, one can choose any field that will be included in a new search. To do this, add button has to be pressed. This button appears after pointing any field from available ones. After adding a specific field, it is marked as selected field in the menu on the left. Search panel is updated automatically. To remove field from a current search, remove button has to be pressed. This button appears after pointing any field from selected ones. Current search can be saved by using 'Save search' option in the menu on the right.",830,594

With switch to virtualbmc we can no longer distinguish between virtual

affects all drivers.

I'm also aware of similar DHCP problems on bare metal.

Also renamed unit tests for clarity.

This includes secondary attached storage similar to the Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) offering. In addition, you can write images to a Block Storage device for Compute to use as a bootable persistent instance. Requirements ------------ - Hitachi NAS Platform Models 3080, 3090, 4040, 4060, 4080, and 4100. - HNAS/SMU software version is 12.2 or higher. - HNAS configuration and management utilities to create a storage pool (span) and an EVS. - GUI (SMU). - SSC CLI. - You must set an iSCSI domain to EVS Supported shared file systems and operations ------------------------------------------- The NFS and iSCSI drivers support these operations: - Create, delete, attach, and detach volumes. - Create, list, and delete volume snapshots. - Create a volume from a snapshot. - Copy an image to a volume. - Copy a volume to an image. - Clone a volume. - Extend a volume. - Get volume statistics. - Manage and unmanage a volume. - Manage and unmanage snapshots (HNAS NFS only).

Add support for swift account quotas on a per-tenant basis. Swift
doesn't expose quota defaults, so that functionality is stubbed out.

In order to retrieve or set quotas for swift, the user/project needs
the ResellerAdmin role set on Swift. Since this commonly isn't the
case (for instance, in the devstack test harness), if the role
(ResellerAdmin by default, but custommizable as SWIFT_ADMIN_ROLE)
is not assigned the quota fields are disabled in the UI (removing them
entirely from the form creates a strange user experience).

Currently the only account quota field supported is bytes until

Remove non-working unit tests (left only the ones that pass
 - let's make it a baseline and add more afterwards).

Fix functional tests (dependency + API urls)

Repository tidy up:

Remove log files from tox from git repo;

Fixup gitreview to point to trove repository;

Make gate tests executable.
