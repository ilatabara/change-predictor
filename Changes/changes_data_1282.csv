In a misconfigured scenario the ImagePropertiesFilter can raise an
exception which causes the image to be unbuildable in the region. This

The fix for memory leakage in the related bug added a check for plugin
deallocation that performed a call to gc.collect() after every test.
This had the side-effect of increasing test execution time by ~50%, so
this patch makes the check optional via an environment variable
(OS_CHECK_PLUGIN_DEALLOCATION).

It may make sense to create a periodic job that runs with the check
enabled, but otherwise the check can be used by developers for
debugging purposes.

This patch adds validation for the segmentation ID when the
network type for the gateway connection is vlan.
This will avoid requests with invalid vlan IDs are sent to
the backend resulting in 500 error responses being
returned to API users.

To this aim this patch slightly alters the current validation
logic due to the fact that some checks are unnecessary since
the same routine sets default values which avoid the
conditions being checked.

Cinder LVMiSCSI driver is using default value of write-cache parameter
of tgtd iscsi driver. In this setting, write I/O from guest instance is
cached on dirty cache of a host.(write-back mode)

In this case, data lost may be occurred if the host crashes before
flushing dirty cache. This may cause a lot of instances to lose
their data.

In order to avoid this issue, it is better to turn off the write cache.
(write-through mode)

This patch adds ""iscsi_write_cache"" parameter to configure a behavior of
write cache. The default value is ""iscsi_write_cache=on"".(write-back mode)

Currently the v2 functional tests are run without the v2 registry enabled.

This means that bugs which are only seen when the v2 registry is enabled
may not be caught by the gate (eg #1308419, #1339775).

Here we enable some basic functional testing (eg image life cycle) with
the v2 registry enabled (in addition to the existing direct-to-database
mode). This should help prevent some types of bugs being introduced.

There is a plan to move some functional tests into tempest, at which
point these additional tests can be removed in favour of equivalent
tempest tests.

This patch adds the 'raise_on_len_mismatch' parameter to the
'delete_nat_rules_by_match' function. The plugin then leverages
this parameter for ensuring NAT rules deletion operations
are completed successfully even when duplicate rules are found
or no corresponding rules are found at all.

With this change, the 'remove_router_interface' operation will
correctly complete even in cases when NAT rules in Neutron and
the NSX backend are out of sync.

This patch also changes a check in delete_nat_rules_by_match in
order to make it less expensive.

In the event of an unrecoverable hardware failure, support needs to
relocate an instance to another compute so it can be rebuilt.

The changes involved in this patch are:
  [*] Add a new v2 extension to determine that the host argument
      on evacuate is now optional.(Extended_evacuate_find_host)
  [*] Doc regeneration.

DocImpact: The evacuate target host is now optional.
If 'host' field is not sent in the request, the scheduler will
determine the target host.
This will include nova client changes ( on the proper commit ) to support
this new optional parameter.

Problem description =================== The reference driver and its utilities currently do not support 'advanced' features, this hinders the forward development of advanced API features suggested in the 'lbaas-api-and-objmodel-improvement' blueprint. In order to support 'advanced' LB API configurations, such as, TLS offloading and L7, the reference driver (HAProxy) must be updated to ensure proper 'backend' behavior and capabilities. Certain features such as TLS session persistence and backend re-encryption will not be supported in this spec. Proposed change =============== The current reference driver named 'namespace_driver' utilizes HAProxy, which as of this writing is at version 1.4. HAProxy 1.4 does not support SSL natively which is the primary concern of this update as it will require the most effort to complete. Other features include L7 content switching, SNI and other new additions proposed in the new API. While some of these features can be exposed in the current HAProxy impl some cannot. For example, SSL termination or offloading, is not supported in the current version of HAProxy and will need to utilize a tool like Stunnel: https://www.stunnel.org. In order to implement these features a few things need to be done: 1. For the features like L7 content switching that are supported the current, and assumingly future releases, the configuration utility in the haproxy driver will need to be updated to take account for these features and may need to view or provide future support for other unsupported features like SSL. It may be best to implement this blueprint: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/94257/ and have it create generic config class the expands all the features. Otherwise additions to the current utility can remain with some refactoring. 2. For SSL and other features that are currently not supported we must configure another service such as the proposed Stunnel application. This new configuration will have to take into consideration a new conf 'stunconf', new pid 'stunpid', the users cert, key and chain, as well as other properties like hostnames to work with SNI. The new config utility should ideally be built as a generic class that could potentially be reused when/if the next version of HAProxy that supports these features is released. blueprint: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/98640 gives additional details regarding halding of TLS 3. Since an additional service will need to spawn in the namespace the namespace_driver itself will need to be updated to handle this. This should be as simple as possible to expedite the upcoming features and projects for Neutron LBaaS. It is proposed that the driver will allow creation of the needed files and spawn the new 'stunnel' instance via a new method called '_spawn_stun' or similar. This new method will be called by the crud operations with the logical config. The method will create the files and call the new config class to build its configuration. It will then have to execute commands to spawn the instance. 4.. There are also tear down methods i.e. undeploy_instance that will need to be updated for proper clean up. (kill pids) 5. When retrieving the logical_config the TLS data defined in the API specs will need to be retrieved from the Barbican service. This could potentially be done within the agent base but needs further discussion. Additional Thoughts: The Stunnel package can be updated via package managers and installed. Those using devstack will not be able to use this feature unless manually installed or devstack itself is updated. This would need to be done at some point. Alternatives ------------ The above solution is what was deemed 'simple', it may not be correct. Alternatively, if we would like to support different TLS offloading tools like Stud we could support plugin or extensions that are loaded in front of HAProxy. etc.. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None. This blueprint is intended to provide capabilities that can be supported in future versions of the REST API. Security impact --------------- Standard Neutron tenant object ownership rules will apply. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- Devstack will need to be updated to install the new packages. Performance Impact ------------------ Additional calls will have to be made to spawn additional instances. TLS offloading increases overhead to the host instance. Other deployer impact --------------------- Deployer will need to ensure new dependencies are installed. Developer impact ---------------- Developers will need to ensure they are using the additional utilities based on the lb configuration. Developers will need to create a utility to retrieve Barbican secrets/data. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ptoohill Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- Update haproxy 'conf' to handle new configurations. Create new configuration class for stunnel. Update namespace_driver. Tests. Dependencies ============ - Depends on stunnel4 or comparable version. - Depends on blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/lbaas-api-and-objmodel-improvement and its successors noted within. - Depends on blueprint: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/94257. Testing ======= Units: - The changes to HAProxy config 'conf' will need to be tested. Verify conf is built as expected - The new configuration utility will need to be tested. Verify conf is built as expected - The additional method and other changes in the namespace_driver needs tested. Verify methods are called/ran Functional: - Verify stunnel instance deployed and functioning. - Verify Barbican communication functions properly. Documentation Impact ==================== Document behavior and capabilities of the refactored reference implementation.

Client already supports -H/--header option when creating container
or uploading objects. This patch extends this option to support
Storage Policy.

e.g.,
    swift post con -H 'X-Storage-Policy:p1'
This creates one container 'con' with storage policy 'p1'.

    swift upload con obj -H 'X-Storage-Policy:p2'
This creates container 'con' with storage policy 'p2' and uploads
object 'obj' into it.

Also fixes segmented uploading to non-default storage policy container

When uploading large objects with segmentation to container with
non-default storage policy, there will be another 'xxx_segments'
container created, but with the default storage policy. This
results all the segments to be stored with the wrong policy.

This patch is for the Storage Policy feature, and also
compatible with old versions w/o Storage Policy support.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================================== Plugin for CDH with Cloudera Manager ==================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sahara/+spec/cdh-plugin This specification proposes to add CDH plugin with Cloudera Distribution of Hadoop and Cloudera Manager in Sahara. Problem description =================== Cloudera is open-source Apache Hadoop distribution, CDH (Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop). CDH contains the main, core elements of Hadoop that provide reliable, scalable distributed data processing of large data sets (chiefly MapReduce and HDFS), as well as other enterprise-oriented components that provide security, high availability, and integration with hardware and other software. Cloudera Manager is the industry's first end-to-end management application for Apache Hadoop. Cloudera Manager provides many useful features for monitoring the health and performance of the components of your cluster (hosts, service daemons) as well as the performance and resource demands of the user jobs running on your cluster. Proposed change =============== CDH plugin implementation will support Cloudera Manager version 5 and CDH version 5. Plugin will support key Sahara features: * Cinder integration * Cluster scaling * EDP * Cluster topology validation * Integration with Swift * Data locality Plugin will be able to install following services: * Cloudera Manager * HDFS * YARN * Oozie CDH plugin will support the following OS: Ubuntu 12.04 and CentOS 6.5. CDH provisioning plugin will support custom mirrors with CDH and CM packages. By default CDH doesn't support Hadoop Swift library. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Deployer impact --------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Sahara-image-elements impact ---------------------------- CDH plugin must be support vanilla images and images with Cloudera packages. For building pre-installed images with Cloudera packages use specific CDH elements. Sahara-dashboard / Horizon impact --------------------------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: sreshetniak Other contributors: iberezovskiy Work Items ---------- * Add implementation of plugin * Add jobs in Sahara-ci * Add integration tests * Add elements to Sahara-image-elements for building images with pre-installed Cloudera packages Dependencies ============ Depends on OpenStack requirements, needs a `cm_api` python library [1] version 6.0.2, which is not present in OS requirements. Testing ======= * Add unit tests to Sahara to cover basic functionality of plugin * Add integration tests to Sahara Documentation Impact ==================== CDH plugin documentation slould be added to the plugin section of Sahara docs.

keyring is conditionally imported if available on your platform,
however not all versions of keyring actually work. Specifically
we have global-requirements of >=2.1,!=3.3, so we know those are
the only versions we believe work.

If you are on an older platform, using system installed
python-keyring, python-keystoneclient won't install a new version,
because it's optional, but then will use a terriblely old verison,
which explodes with dbus errors.

The fix is to be more explicit on import.

In order for a user to access the instances in their tenant, a special VPN instance (code named cloudpipe) needs to be created. Compute generates a certificate and key for the user to access the VPN and starts the VPN automatically.

The tenant gets a range of private IPs that are only accessible from inside the VLAN. In order for a user to access the instances in their tenant, a special VPN instance (code named cloudpipe) needs to be created. Compute generates a certificate and key for the user to access the VPN and starts the VPN automatically.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================== TripleO and Docker ================== # TODO: file the actual blueprint... https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tripleo/+spec/tripleo-and-docker The goal of this spec is to detail how Docker might be used within TripleO to run the services needed for the Overcloud. Docker is an attractive implementation for TripleO because it provides benefits around application isolation, security, and ease of upgrading/downgrading. Problem description =================== The deployer wants to use Docker containers for Overcloud services, as opposed to using baremetal nodes to deploy overcloud images. We should support running each Overcloud service in its own container in order to be as flexible as possible to deploy needs. Proposed change =============== In order to make Docker containers available as deployment targets for the Overcloud, we need Nova Compute nodes configured to use the Docker driver registered with the undercloud Nova. Even when you plan to deploy to containers, the undercloud must still be running a Nova compute with the ironic driver in order to allow for scaling itself out to add additional compute nodes. To accmplish this, we can run 2 Nova compute processes on each undercloud node. One configured with Nova+Ironic and one configured with Nova+Docker. For the straight baremetal deployment, where Docker is not desired, it will not be included. This would be accomplished via the standard inclusion/exclusion of elements during a diskimage-builder tripleo image build. To minimize the changes needed to the elements, we will aim to run a full init stack in the container, such as systemd. This will allow all the services that we need to also be running in the container (cloud-init, os-collect-config, etc). It will also make troubleshooting similar to the baremetal process in that you'd be able to ssh to individual containers, read logs, restart services, turn on debug mode, etc. Alternatives ------------ An alternative to having the undercloud deploy additional Docker compute nodes would be to register additional baremetal nodes with the seed vm, and then describe an undercloud stack in a template that is the undercloud controller and it's set of Docker compute nodes. When the undercloud is deployed via the seed, all the nodes are set up initially. The drawback with that approach is that the seed is meant to be short-lived in the long term. So, it then becomes difficult to scale out the undercloud if needed. We could offer a hybrid of the 2 models: launch all nodes initially from the seed, but still have the functionality in the undercloud to deploy more Docker compute nodes if needed. We should also consider any non-baremetal Nova driver as a possible target of deployment for Overcloud services. Someone may desire to deploy overcloud services running in kvm or libvirt+lxc, etc. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- We should aim for equivalent security when deploying to containers as we do when deploying to baremetal. To the best of our ability, it should not be possible to compromise the container if an individual service is compromised. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- We should document the option of deploying to Docker containers in our deployment docs in tripleo-incubator. Performance Impact ------------------ Ideally, deploying an overcloud to containers should result in a faster deployment than deploying to baremetal. Other deployer impact --------------------- The main impact to deployers will be the ability to use containers if they wish. They also must understand how to use nova-baremetal/ironic on the undercloud to scale out the undercloud and add additional docker compute nodes if needed. Developer impact ---------------- Developers working on TripleO will have the option of deploying to containers. This should make testing and developing on some aspects of TripleO easier due to the need for less vm's. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: james-slagle Work Items ---------- tripleo-image-elements ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Where needed, we should continue breaking out individual elements into smaller fined grained units. When deploying containers, the service running in the container should be the smallest unit of scale where possible, so that individual services can be scaled up/down as needed. nova-api is one such example, which actually installs 5 different services. We also need new elements for the nova docker driver and docker registry. The element for the nova docker driver should allow it to be installed alongside another nova compute process (different nova.conf, etc). tripleo-heat-templates ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ tripleo-heat-templates would be changed to break out each service where needed into it's own template. For example, instead of having an overcloud control and compute template, we would have template fragments for each service that somone might desire to deploy separately in a container. This would follow similarly to what's been done today for cinder and swift, but would take it a step further and break it out into per service templates. The Makefile (and if needed, merge.py) would be updated so that the same set of undercloud/overcloud templates could be generated as they are today. This change is beneficial because whether you're deploying via baremetal or Docker, you'd be using the same template source. Makefile targets would be added for each service in tripleo-heat-templates. If needed, separate Makefile targets would be added if the one overcloud.yaml couldn't be used for both a baremetal and Docker deployment. The ability to generate a template for an undercloud node that is running both compute+ironic and compute+docker would also be added to the Makefile. diskimage-builder ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ We'd also need diskimage-builder steps that show how to build images for the docker compute nodes. We'd support the same set of base OS's that we do today, where Docker is well supported (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc). Buidling docker images via diskimage-builder ought to be pretty straightforward since a docker image is just a tarball of the file system. The resultant images can then be imported into Docker and pushed to a registry that has the undercloud glance configured as a backend. The images will then be available in glance for use by Nova/Heat. Nova scheduling filters ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Since the undercloud will have compute nodes registered with different compute_driver configurations, ComputeFilters and ImagePropertiesFilter may need to be used to make sure the Docker compute nodes are used for the overcloud deployment and the baremetal compute nodes are used for scaling out the undercloud itself. The image property hypervisor_type can be set on images in glance to make sure certain images are deployed to certain hypervisors. If needed, an option could be added to load-image to set this property on Docker images. tripleo-incubator ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Document how to use Docker to deploy the overcloud. Document how to troubleshoot an Overcloud running in Docker. Add an option to devtest to use Docker to deploy the overcloud. Dependencies ============ This effort depends on continued development on the nova Docker driver. We would need to drive any missing features or bugfixes that were needed in that project: https://git.openstack.org/cgit/stackforge/nova-docker Testing ======= We would need a separate set of CI jobs that were configured to deploy an Overclout to Docker. The CI jobs should be considered non-voting since they'd rely on a stackforge project which isn't officially part of OpenStack. Documentation Impact ==================== As yet, there are no official OpenStack docs for TripleO. However, we should update the TripleO specific docs in tripleo-incubator to document how to use Docker for an Overcloud deployment.

We have to mark all nodes to error explicitly in case of failed cluster
updating. Such behaviour was implemented for regular deploy process
but was mistakenly omitted for the update process.

Please keep in mind, that all nodes are marked as error only in case
Astute didn't sent per-node status information.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Start/End Event Notifications ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/start-end-notifications Problem description =================== The Cinder service currently does not emit .start/.end event notifications. This makes it difficult to track or monitor when a particular event is finished or the cause of why it failed. A monitor may want to know when a volume create started and when exactly did it finish. Currently, they would have to query the database to see the status but that only gives them if is succeeded or failed, not how long it took. For this information the log files would have to be checked or constant polling if the status has been updated or finished. Proposed change =============== Cinder should provide .start/.end notifications for the basic volume operations such as create, delete, extend, clone, etc... The change would include using a @wrap_volume_event decorator that could be placed on the volume actions that would emit notifications with details. The volume.create.start notification upon a new volume would contain payload information similiar to the following: * request_id: Request ID of the request (string) * tenant_id: Tenant ID that owns the this volume (string) * user_id: User ID that owns this volume (string) * volume_id: Volume ID of this volume (string) * volume_type: Name of the volume type of this volume. (string) * display_name: User selected display name for volume. * start_time: Timestamp for when this volume's create started (string, formatted 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.ssssss') * status: Current status of volume. (string, such as 'available' or 'attached') * size: size of disk allocation for this volume. The volume.create.end notification upon a new volume would contain payload information similiar to the following: * request_id: Request ID of the request (string) * volume_id: Volume ID of this volume (string) * finish_time: Timestamp for when this volume's create finished (string, formatted 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.ssssss') * result: Result of the event request(string, such as 'success' or 'error') If errors occurred the following during the event additional information would be populated if available: * message: Exception message(string) * traceback: Exception traceback(string) The change would use the Oslo's messaging that is available today in OpenStack as documented on the Oslo Messaging wiki: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Oslo/Messaging This feature would be new to Cinder but both Nova and Neutron are emitting these events today. Sandy Walsh has a blog that describes the current notification usage report card for OpenStack services, see: http://www.sandywalsh.com Alternatives ------------ No other alternatives exists other than the notification messaging mechanism. I choose to use Oslo's meessaging notification as opposed to taskflows notifications, that provides too much detail for each stage of volume create. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- I would say this has negligible security impact. It does emit some of the cinder volume information on the message bus. There is still nothing preventing someone from looking at the values of the volume in horizon or from the cinder command line. Notifications impact -------------------- Additional notifications would be added as described above. These would be immediate notifications as describe on the Notification Examples and Quick Reference wiki page: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/NotificationEventExamples Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ This would be adding additional messages to the notification queue via the volume actions that would have @wrap_volume_event decorator. Other deployer impact --------------------- The end user would need to need to configure the notification_driver and notification_topics in the cinder.conf file, if non defualts values would be used. Developer impact ---------------- This won't affect Cinder per say unless a new volume action is added to Cinder and that requires .start/.end notifications. The decorator could just be added to the manager action in that case. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: <kurt-f-martin> Other contributors: <None> Work Items ---------- * New decorator @wrap_volume_event: Wraps a method to log the event taken on the volume, and results. (volume/manager.py) * Add @wrap_volume_event decorator to VolumeManager create_volume, delete_volume... methods. * New EventReporter class: Context manager to report volume action events.(volume/utils.py) * New file cinder/safe_utils.py: Utilities and helper functions that won't produce circular imports. * Unit test Dependencies ============ Oslo Messaging(already part of cinder) Testing ======= New unit test will have to be written to test the new notifications. Documentation Impact ==================== The OpenStack Cloud Admin Guide would need to list the notification system options that where supported by cinder. Also, the System Usage wiki should be update to correct the volume information, as it has information still from nova volume, see: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/SystemUsageData References ========== * references noted above ",,173,0

The Fedora rabbitmq-server package requires an ephemeral port to be
used. Otherwise the service will fail to start if selinux is in enforcing
mode.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1032595

This patch moves the cluster port from 5535 to 61000. Port 61000 is
also reserved through sysctl by setting it as the value for
ip_local_reserved_ports.

We have a problem when user has failed upgrade
and during some time he can run the same upgrade
again, in this case user will have outdated db data

In the patch we create database dump with postfix
N in the name, where N is integer which is unique
for the directory and which we increment each
script run.

Don't fail upgrade script if it was not able
to make database dump and there is database
dump in the directory.

Also we keep only 3 latest dumps.

turned on for these tests to be run and turning on this dashboard
was not mandatory.

Instead of calling resource_get_by_name_and_stack once for every
resource in the stack, db_api.resource_get_all_by_stack is called
only once for all resources.

This reduces the number of sql queries during a describe_stack_resource
call to 3:
1. load the stack
2. load the template
3. load the resources

This is a big improvement over the start of this patch series, which
is 2 queries plus:

* 1 per access to a resource data value

There is probably still potential to reduce queries from 3, but this

resource_data_get_all queries the database for the data, and
transforms the results to a decrypted dict.

If the data is already loaded then it is unnecessary to do the

This change allows data to be passed in as an optional argument.
If the passed data is not None then no database call will be made
and the dict transformation will occur on passed data.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Add GBP support to ODL ML2 Driver ========================================== Problem description =================== The Group Based Policy blueprint has proposed new application centric APIs for Neutron. Similar to the work in Neutron, there is work in the OpenDaylight project to implement these APIs as well. With the APIs being implenented in both Open Source projects, we need to update the OpenDaylight ML2 driver to proxy the new GBP APIs over to OpenDaylight. Proposed change =============== The proposed change will add support for the new GBP APIs, as documented in the GBP BP, into the OpenDaylight ML2 MechanismDriver. Similar to how the existing Neutron APIs are sent to the ODL Controller, the GBP APIs will also be sent over to the ODL Controller. Alternatives ------------ There are no alternatives as this is simply adding support for the new Group Based Policy APIs into the OpenDaylight MechanismDriver. Data model impact ----------------- None, as this change is simply adding support for new API extensions. REST API impact --------------- The ODL ML2 MechanismDriver will have support for the new GBP API extensions added. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- Users deploying Juno with the Group Based Policy extensions will be able to utilze these new APIs in conjunction with the Helium version of OpenDaylight. Performance Impact ------------------ No change here. Other deployer impact --------------------- To utilize the GBP APIs with OpenDaylight, the following versions of software are required: * Neutron: Juno * OpenDaylight: Helium Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Kyle Mestery (mestery) Ryan Moats (regXboi) Work Items ---------- * Add support for GBP APIs into ODL MechanismDriver. Dependencies ============ This work is dependent on the GBP APIs being merged in Juno. Testing ======= Additional unit tests will be added. Further, new tempest tests for GBP will be run in the OpenDaylight CI system. Documentation Impact ==================== The documentation will be updated to show support for the GBP API extensions in the ODL MechanismDriver.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ====================================== Switch from MySQLdb to MySQL Connector ====================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/switch-to-mysql-connector Switch from MySQLdb to MySQL Connector which provides multiple benefits, including resilence of code and potential performance advantages. Problem description =================== Current MySQL client library we use (MySQLdb) plays bad with eventlet and may result in db deadlocks (see [#dead_locks]_). It also blocks execution of other green threads while we're deep in the library code (see [#one_thread]_). To avoid those issues, we need to switch to a pure python library with better eventlet support. MySQL Connector [#official_page]_ is an official MySQL Python client library and has the needed qualities. Proposed change =============== Neutron already supports using other MySQL dialects [#dialects]_ thru oslo.db library. SQLAlchemy that we use supports switching client libraries by modifying SQL connection URI that we pass to the service as a configuration option. So most work is around devstack, documentation, and oslo.db. Alternatives ------------ Some database lock timeouts can be mitigated by refactoring code [#hack_around_notifications]_. We may also introduce special mechanisms that would reduce chance for the current thread to yield under transaction that is one of the main causes of db deadlocks. This wouldn't fix all the issues though. There is always a chance that multiple clients send requests to update the same locked row in the database, resulting in another deadlock. We could also switch to another library that is also supported by SQLAlchemy. Though those other libraries do not provide clear benefits in comparison to MySQL Connector, while the latter is the official module of MySQL project. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ Though MySQL Connector is a pure Python library, while MySQLdb is largely written in C, and we could expect that the new module is a bit slower than the current one, performance may actually be improved. This is because the new module is eventlet aware, meaning threads will be able to switch while waiting for i/o from a database server. This expectation is proved by the following measurements [#measurements]_. Other deployer impact --------------------- Distributors and operators will need to make sure new library is available, installed and configured for Neutron to get its benefits. That said, old connection value should continue working, though with sporadic deadlocks and thread blocks on db code. Developer impact ---------------- Dialects are not completely isolated by SQLAlchemy, so some SQL operations may require adjustments in code. F.e. the new dialect does not seem to like multiple SQL statements concatenated and passed to engine.execute() Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ihar-hrachyshka Work Items ---------- The following items should be handled before claiming migration to be completed: * update devstack to set Neutron to use MySQL Connector instead of MySQLdb. * update installation guide to direct operators to install proper packages and set their configuration to use the new library. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= Existing tests are enough to check that migration doesn't result in any regressions. Documentation Impact ==================== We should update installation guide with new instructions on client library installation and setting proper 'connection' value for SQL connection URI.

We also want to rewrite the manifest after changing the contents of

The domain name gets added to the initiator name used by the host
if it's an Active Directory member.

Currently the method which gets the initiator name does not take
this into account when retrieving the default initiator name.

Trying to use a wrong initiator name will lead to an exception when
trying to log in to the according iSCSI target.

This patch simply appends the domain name (when the host is an AD
member) to the initiator name used to log in to iSCSI targets.

Module 'service_instance' creates service_subnet per neutron_subnet,
current mask is 29, that allows take only 3 (three) ips for service
instances. Changed mask to 28, that allows take 11 (eleven) ips now
by default.
It allows us to use multibackend installation with drivers, that

Changes:
- added config option for network subnets mask with default value 28,
  instead of hardcoded 29.
- fixed related unittests

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ======================================== Power driver for SNMP-enabled smart PDUs ======================================== Launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ironic/+spec/ironic-snmp-power-driver This blueprint proposes a mechanism for remote control of node power by enabling or disabling sockets on a rack power strip. The result will be a much wider generalisation of the hardware that can be controlled by Ironic. Problem description =================== Currently Ironic's physical hardware support is restricted to servers implementing power control with embedded management hardware, for example a BMC or other system that implements IPMI. This blueprint proposes widening Ironic's capabilities by adding support for a class of power devices that are controllable by SNMP, including smart PDUs with network connectivity. Implementing an interface to smart PDUs would provide benefits including: * The ability to control bare metal compute nodes built from commodity hardware that does not include a BMC. A cost-conscious user may want to use bare metal compute without the additional expense of server equipment that supports integrated power management. * The potential to control arbitrary other classes of hardware, such as network switches, middleboxes and other racked data center devices. A power-conscious user may want to power off sections of network while attached server hardware is also out of service. Proposed change =============== The proposed design would introduce a new driver to Ironic, snmp.py. A driver class would provide the SNMP MIB read-write mechanisms. Classes would derive from this base driver to add vendor-specific MIB OIDs and methods for interfacing with different vendor equipment. The proposed design would use PySNMP to perform the SNMP transactions. Note that this blueprint only proposes power management for baremetal compute node instances, although a sufficiently general mechanism could be extended to arbitrary physical devices. Alternatives ------------ There is no clear alternative mechanism for interfacing with smart PDUs. Screen-scraping of human-formatted data from CLI terminals or web interfaces sounds like a bad idea that will result in a design that was susceptible to firmware version dependencies that are not a factor when using the SNMP interface. Data model impact ----------------- On creation of an Ironic bare metal node, additional attributes would be attached to the node object: * snmp_driver - The class of power driver to interface with. This will identify a vendor-specific MIB interface to use. * snmp_address - The hostname or IP address of the power driver. * snmp_community - The write community to use for changing power state. * snmp_outlet - The power outlet number on the power device. These attributes would be passed through with other instance data to the Ironic SNMP driver and used to generate the SNMP operations to achieve the required power action. REST API impact --------------- None. Driver API impact ----------------- None. Nova driver impact ------------------ None. Security impact --------------- Providing access to power management has obvious implications, but these are not substantially different between one mechanism and another. An argument could be made that the PDU outlets provide access to more devices than might otherwise be reachable from Ironic. If a user was able to effect a change in the attributes associated with her nodes, it could be possible to affect the power of other devices in the system. This is no different from other power mechanisms. Other end user impact --------------------- Providing remote control of the outlets on a smart PDU creates a dependency on the connection of the power leads attached to the smart PDU. To use the outlets for power control, the mapping between bare metal node and power outlet must be accurately maintained. However, this is no different from any other scenario in which smart PDUs are deployed. Scalability impact ------------------ The scalability load is no different from other mechanisms using a network protocol for power control. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- This driver would not be enabled in a default configuration. To enable this driver in a deployment, driver-specific data would need to be supplied as bare metal node properties. The mapping of power outlets to bare metal nodes would also need to be determined. Developer impact ---------------- There should be no impact on other Ironic development activity. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: <stigtelfer> Work Items ---------- * Develop the framework and base class SNMP power driver. * Add derived classes for interfacing with various PDU vendor MIBs. Dependencies ============ This project would have a dependency on the PySNMP module. The dependency could be relaxed to a dynamic runtime dependency that only applied if the configuration was enabled. This would also enable unit testing without importing PySNMP. Testing ======= The standard driver unit tests can easily be ported to apply to the new SNMP driver. The module will be tested and used in production with all available PDU equipment on-site (APC, Teltronix). Other collaborators with PDUs from different vendors would make a valuable contribution to increasing test coverage and qualifying other PDU hardware. A Tempest suite could be created in which a dummy power management system was implemented, in the same manner as the fake ssh driver. Documentation Impact ==================== A detailed description of the driver parameters would be needed. A list of tested and qualified PDU hardware would also be helpful. Additionally, any brief notes (in wiki form) on how to configure PDUs from various vendors would be valuable. References ========== * PySNMP home page: http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/ ",,199,0

Currently when using stunnel to terminate services using SSL (https) the
original http ports are still available to 'external' nodes.

Here we configure some basic firewall settings to disallow 'external'
connections to the services' http ports.

For now we allow connection from the nova compute nodes to the services'
http ports as using https for those connections is not there yet.

Problem description =================== This blueprint specifies need of HP’s modular L2 mechanism driver to automate the provisioning of HP’s ToR switches using OVSDB.In current Openstack neutron deployment VM’s attached to the overlay network could not communicate to the network devices/bare-metal servers attached to the physical networks. We need a driver in ML2 to synchronize the overlay information, Hypervisor VTEP, VM MAC etc., to OVSDB and HP’s ToR will read the OVSDB to provide access to bare-metal (physical) appliances to the logical network. Use Cases: 1. VMs in VXLAN Overlay networks talks to physical server that is connected to the HP TOR switches 2. Auto synchronize the neutron DB(VNI , L2 Network details etc) to the OVSDB 3. Software VTEP information to the OVSDB 4. Poll OVSDB for physical servers , physical port added/deleted details and update in neutron DB Proposed change =============== The diagram below provides a high level overview of how the HP driver interacts with OVSDB that is running on remote HOST .

The biggest advantage of using the ML2 mechanism driver approach is that it allows us to easily use the existing OVS agent. Data model impact ----------------- No existing models are changed. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- Additionally, the deployer must configure the ML2 plugin to include the openvswitch mechanism driver before the HP mechanism driver: :: [ml2] mechanism_drivers = openvswitch,hp_mech Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Selvakumar S(sels) Work Items ---------- The work is split up into two parts: 1. Leveraging jsonrpc library * This driver uses jsonrpclib (JSON-RPC 1.0) library for communicating to the OVSDB server that is running separately from ToR unlike Arista. 2. Implement additional network entity called NetworkGateway in the driver for handling connecting l2 networks to the physical l2 gateway Dependencies ============ There are no new library requirements. The following third party library is used: * requests Testing ======= The testing is run in a setup with an OpenStack deployment (devstack) connected to a HP Vendor controller that configures the TOR switch Documentation Impact ==================== Configuration details.

1. The database name is a random string, so shouldn't already exist.
2. If it *does* already exist, we quite likely want to throw an error
   rather than just delete it.
3. ""drop database if exists non_existant_database"" throws an error with
   mysqlconnector and a noisy-but-harmless warning with others.

(We could fix (3), if it was important)

For consistency, this also makes drop_database raise an error if the
database doesn't exist (or has been already deleted).

However, in the current implementation (version i), booting up a large number of homogeneous VMs is time-consuming. To overcome this drawback, we propose a lightweight patch for Nova, which adopts a third-party library, called VMThunder, for fast booting homogeneous VMs. VMThunder accelerates the booting process through on-demand data transfer in a P2P manner. Problem description =================== Currently, Openstack provides two categories of methods for booting a virtual machine: (i) booting from a local image or (ii) booting from a remote Cinder volume. The first category needs to copy the entire image to a compute node, making it suffer from a long transfer delay for large images. The second category remotely attaches a volume to a VM and transfers only the necessary data from the volume, thus having better performance. However, this approach only allows booting a single VM from a volume at a time. Moreover, preparing a volume for each VM requires a long time. As a result, it is currently inevitable to take a long time for booting a large number of homogeneous VMs in Openstack. Proposed change =============== We propose to add a new method, named ""Boot from VMThunder"", for fast booting multiple homogeneous VMs. This method uses a third-party library (VMThunder) to support simultaneous booting of a large number of VMs. VMThunder configures each VM with two volumes (the figure can be found here http://www.kylinx.com/vmthunder/vmthunder.png): a (read-only) template volume exactly the same as the pre-created original volume and a (writable) snapshot volume storing each VM's difference to the template. The original volume is the root of a template volume relay tree, and each VM fetches only the necessary data from its parent over the multi-path iSCSI protocol. In addition, VMThunder makes use of a compute node's local storage as a cache to accelerate the image transferring process and avoid a repetitive data transfer. The P2P-style, on-demand data transfer dramatically accelerates VMs' booting process. Our modification to Nova is light-weighted (about 80 lines of insertions and deletions). Two major functions, i.e., the creation and deletion of the template and snapshot volumes, are implemented as following: (i) creation: We add a volume-driver class (about 50 lines, depends on VMThunder's API) in file ""nova/virt/block_device.py"" to prepare the template and snapshot volumes. (ii) deletion: We add a delete method (about 20 lines, depends on VMThunder's API) in file ""nova/compute/manager.py' to destroy the unused template and snapshot volumes. More details of the implementation can be found in the following links: Paper, http://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/td/preprint/06719385.pdf Modification diff file, http://www.kylinx.com/vmthunder/diff2.txt VMThunder demo videos, http://www.kylinx.com/vmthunder/boot_vmthunder_win7_success-V2.mp4 Image booting demo videos, http://www.kylinx.com/vmthunder/boot_image_test_win7_success-V2.mp4 Alternatives ------------ (1)Image cache: Nova's image-caching facility reduces the start-up time for creating homogeneous virtual machines on one nova-compute node. However, it helps neither the first-time provisioning nor the Cinder-based booting process. (2)P2P transferring: The P2P protocol can increase the speed of the file distribution. For example, the glance-bittorrent-delivery proposal transfers the image templates from the glance storage to Nova-compute servers. This approach, however, needs to transfer the entire image to all peers. (3)Backend storage optimization: The distributed storages like NFS, cluster FS, distributed FS or SAN can decrease the size of transferred volumes. However, the I/O pressure on the storage servers increases dramatically when powering on a large number of homogeneous VMs, since there may not be enough replicas on the storage servers for offloading the I/O demands. (4)Multi-attach volume: (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Cinder/blueprints/multi-attach-volume) This approach allows a volume to be attached to more than one instance simultaneously. As a result, volumes can be shared among multiple guests when the instances are already available. Besides, these volumes can also be used for booting a number of VMs by enforcing the multi-attach volumes as read-only image disks. Unfortunately, this approach does not scale well because of the star-structured topology in the data dissemination process. (5)Direct image access: (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/nova-image-zero-copy). This approach uses the direct_url of the Glance v2 API, such that the number of needed hops to transfer an image to a Nova-compute node is decreased. When images are stored at multiple backend locations, the Nova-compute servers can select a proper image storage for speeding up the downloading process. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ We will significantly decrease the delay of booting up large numbers of Cinder-volume-based VMs. Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: vmThunderGroup (vmthunder) Work Items ---------- We only add one lightweight patch for Nova. Dependencies ============ The patch depends on the VMThunder project (https://launchpad.net/VMThunder). Testing ======= We will add necessary tests into nova's test framework, in order to show the effectiveness of VMThunder. The unit tests and integrated tests will be added to the component. Documentation Impact ==================== We need to document how to create many homogeneous virtual machines though our new option.

This is mostly mechanical, but it does expose what appears to be a bug
in the interaction between object.Instance's config_drive field and
configdrive.required_by(). object.Instance defines config_drive to be
a String, but configdrive.required_by() expects it to be a Boolean. In
assigning a boolean value to config_drive, it is cast to a String,
which evaluates as True when cast back to a Boolean. We therefore
update the tests which use config_drive to set either a String value,
or None, which is what other code does.

Note that Nova does not pass an Instance object to all driver methods,
so not all uses can be updated.

ML2 provider networks partial specs let admins choose some provider
network attributes and let neutron choose remaining attributes. This
change provides the implementation for VLAN provider networks.

In practice, for VLAN provider networks provider:physical_network
and provider:segmentation_id choices can be delegated to neutron,
in such case neutron will try to find a network in tenant network
pools which respects provided provider attributes.

Problem description =================== PLUMgrid Director(s) requires information of OpenStack Neutron APIs to manage networking. In order to recieve such information from neutron service, a new ML2 mechanism driver is needed to post the data to PLUMgrid Director. The following sections describe the proposed changes in Neutron, a new ML2 mechanism driver, and make it possible to use OpenStack with PLUMgrid virtual network infrastructure. The following diagram depicts the OpenStack deployment with PLUMgrid virtual network infrastructure. PLUMgrid-OpenStack Topology:: +-----------------------+ +----------------+ | | | | | OpenStack | | | | Controller | | | | Node | | | | | | | | +---------------------+ | PLUMgrid | | |PLUMgrid mechanism | REST API | Director | | |driver |--------------| | | | | | | +-+--------+-----+------+ +--+----------+--+ | | | | | | | | | +--------------+ | | | | | | +----------+---------+ +---+---------+------+ | | | | | | | IOvisor | | IOvisor | | +--------------------+ ---- +--------------------+ | | OpenStack compute | | OpenStack compute | | | node 1 | | node n | | +----------+---------+ +--------------------+ | | | | | +-----------------------------------------+ As shown in the diagram above, each OpenStack compute node is connected to PLUMgrid Director, which is responsible for provisioning, monitoring and troubleshooting of cloud network infrastructures, which includes PLUMgrid virtual network infrastructure. The Neutron API requests will be proxied to PLUMgrid Director, then network topology information can be built and deployed. The compute nodes will have PLUMgrid IOvisor running. Proposed change =============== The requirements for ML2 mechanism driver to support PLUMgrid virtual network infrastructure are as follow: 1. PLUMgrid Director exchanges information with OpenStack controller node by using REST API. To support this, we need a specific client. 2. OpenStack controller (Neutron configured with ML2 plugin) must be configured with PLUMgrid Director access credentials. Sequence flow of events for a sample API call (create_network) is as follow: :: create_network { neutron -> ML2_plugin ML2_plugin -> PG-MD PG-MD -> PLUMgrid Director PG-MD <-- PLUMgrid Director ML2_plugin <-- PG-MD neutron <-- ML2_plugin } Alternatives ------------ The alternative would be to continue using the monolithic plugin for PLUMgrid. In order to simplify the controller and in order to take advantage of the support for various extensions already available in ML2 and to avoid replicating code as much as possible and in order to simplify the maintenance of our code we have decided to make the move to ML2 and develop a mechanism driver for it. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- 1. Configuration parameters for PLUMgrid mechanism driver will have to be updated.

Problem description =================== Currently, the Big Switch ML2 driver is only responsible for configuring VLANs in the fabric. It doesn't do anything with the vSwitch so it leaves the responsibility of binding the ports to the OpenVSwitch driver. However, it needs to support IVS switches as well, which will not have a binding driver since they are directly controlled by the backend controller. Therefore, it will need to be responisble for responding to the bind_port calls for hosts with the IVS switches and mark them as bound. Proposed change =============== At the port binding method to the Big Switch ML2 driver and have it respond to port binding calls for IVS ports.

To handle these cases, the Big Switch plugin needs to inform the L3 agent to perform these functions while leaving regular routing up to the fabric for performance. Problem description =================== The physical switches that the BSN fabric uses for routing have limited table sizes for rules. Under heavy load, there may be too many virtual machines with floating IPs and SNAT for the switch to handle. Proposed change =============== To optionally offload the job of SNAT and floating IP translation, the backend controller will issue a message back to the plugin on router creation that it needs an L3 agent router to be created as well. The plugin will then issue the RPC message to have the router instantiated on an L3 agent with a different router IP address. All first-hop traffic will be handled by the fabric, but any traffic leaving the tenant will be routed through the L3 agent for floating IP translation or source NAT. It is important to note that the creation of the L3 agent router is determined by the backend controller. If there is a physical NAT box in the network, the controller may use that instead, in which case no L3 agent router would be created.

For this scenario, the plugin needs to pass a port with a vlan network type and a VLAN to the OVS plugin agent for the vswitch to be configured with the appropriate VLAN translation rule to match the fabric's expectation for that segment. Problem description =================== The Big Switch plugin currently assumes all of the vswitches will have a direct connection to the backend controller for the provisioning of rules. Under this condition there was no need to leverage the OVS plugin agent since connectivity and segmentation was completely controlled by the rules installed in the vswitches by the controller. However, some deployments have incompatible vswitches that can't be changed out so they need to be controlled by the OpenvSwitch agent. In this scenario, a VLAN needs to be passed to the openvswitch agent to configure the appropriate VLAN rewrite rule to match the fabric's configured VLAN for that segment at that compute node's connection point. Proposed change =============== Add support for the the OVS plugin agent to the Big Switch plugin by including the appropriate RPC classes and by populating RPC port messages with the appropriate VLAN to configure. Alternatives ------------ There is no other way to support a mixed environment like this. Data model impact ----------------- N/A REST API impact --------------- Security impact --------------- N/A Notifications impact -------------------- None. All compute nodes already receive port notifications for security group operations. Other end user impact --------------------- N/A Performance Impact ------------------ N/A Other deployer impact --------------------- For compute nodes using OVS without a connection to the controller, the OVS plugin agent will need to be installed instead of the Big Switch agent. Developer impact ---------------- N/A Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: kevinbenton Work Items ---------- * Setup RPC code with appropriate callbacks and libraries as necessary * Add unit tests to make sure port messages are dispatched appropirately * Add 3rd party CI test scenario Dependencies ============ This depends on the provider net extension being integrated into the plugin.[1] Testing ======= Since this is leveraging the existing agent, the only component that needs to be tested is the dispatch of correct RPC messages. Unit tests can cover this. The BSN 3rd party CI system will be modified to test this as well. Documentation Impact ==================== Deployment guide for Big Switch plugin needs to be updated with option for an out-of-control OVS bridge.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ======================================================== FWaaS changes to support Distributed Virtual Router(DVR) ======================================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/neutron-dvr-fwaas Problem description =================== As we move to the DVR model, current L3 based services such as FWaaS that rely on seeing both sides of the traffic on the same namespace router are broken. The reference implementation of FWaaS is built on iptables and is stateful in that connections are tracked. DVR by intent distributes the routing functionality across instances on compute nodes and all traffic is no longer routed through a centralized router to achieve goals of scalability. Proposed change =============== To maintain FWaaS functionality in the context of a DVR deployment a phased approach is being advocated. Phase1: Ensure that FWaaS works as an L3 Perimeter Firewall so North - South traffic can be subject to Firewall Rules. DVR[1] classifies North - South traffic into two categories: Default SNAT use case - traffic flowing out to the external network will go through the Network Node and the SNAT Namespace hosted there to get out. Response traffic will again go thru the SNAT Namespace for translation and then directly switched to the appropriate VM in a Compute Node. VM's with Floating IP's(FIP) use case - traffic flowing out will go through the Internal Router and then the FIP Namespace on the Compute Node for translation and then the external network through it's br-ex. And on the incoming traffic again the flow is through the br-ex on the Compute Node, then the FIP Namespace for translation and through the Internal Router to the VM. DVR runs L3Agent on the Network Node as well as on the Compute Nodes. Since the FWaaS Agent runs in the context of the L3Agent the FWaaS Plugin - Agent messaging is available. In the context of both of the above use cases, FWaaS Agent on the Network Node should install the Firewall Rules in the SNAT Namespace and the FWaaS Agent in the Compute Nodes should install the Firewall Rules in the FIP Namespace. In this manner the FWaaS requirement of seeing traffic on both directions is satisfied for both of these use cases. Phase2: Distribute the Firewall Rules across all DVR instances so that one can enable Firewalls on the East - West traffic as well. Few approaches are being considered to distribute the rules in a manner similar to Security Groups for this use case. This is being listed for completeness and will be covered post Juno. At this point the focus is on Phase 1 so we atleast have coverage on the North - South traffic to support a perimeter Firewall. Alternatives ------------ None. Data model impact ----------------- No impact, the changes are on the Agent/iptables Driver. REST API impact --------------- No new REST API is introduced. Security impact --------------- The effort is to minimize the Security impact as DVR functionality breaks FWaaS. Coverage for North - South traffic but no support for East - West traffic. Notifications impact -------------------- None to existing. Other end user impact --------------------- No Support for FWaaS on East - West traffic. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- Deployers should be aware that this targets only North - South functionality. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: skandasw / badveli_vishnuus / (TBD) Other contributors: TBD Work Items ---------- Dependencies ============ Testing ======= Unit tests, Tempest API tests.

Problem description =================== The ML2 plugin does not adequately support hierarchical network topologies. A hierarchical network might have different network segment types (VLAN, VXLAN, GRE, proprietary fabric, ...) at different levels, and might be made up of one or more top-level static network segments along with dynamically allocated network segments at lower levels. For example, traffic between ToR and core switches could encapsulate virtual networks using VXLAN segments, while traffic between ToR switches and compute nodes would use dynamically allocated VLANs segments. :: +-------------+ | | | Core Switch | | | +---+-----+---+ VXLAN | | VXLAN +-----------+ +------------+ | | +------+-----+ +------+-----+ | | | | | ToR Switch | | ToR Switch | | | | | +---+---+----+ +---+----+---+ VLAN | | VLAN VLAN | | VLAN +-------+ +----+ +----+ +------+ | | | | +----+----+ +----+----+ +----+----+ +----+----+ | | | | | | | | | Compute | | Compute | | Compute | | Compute | | Node | | Node | | Node | | Node | | | | | | | | | +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ Dynamically allocating segments at lower levels of the hierarchy is particularly important in allowing neutron deployments to scale beyond the 4K limit per physical network for VLANs. VLAN allocations can be managed at lower levels of the hierarchy, allowing many more than 4K virtual networks to exist and be accessible to compute nodes as VLANs, as long as each link from ToR switch to compute node needs no more than 4K VLANs simultaneously. Proposed change =============== ML2 will support hierarchical network topologies by binding ports to mechanism drivers and network segments at each level of the hierarchy. For example, one mechanism driver might bind to a static VXLAN segment of the network, causing a ToR switch to bridge that network to a dynamically allocated VLAN on the link(s) to the compute node(s) connected to that switch, while a second mechanism driver, such as the existing OVS or HyperV driver, would bind the compute node to that dynamic VLAN. Supporting hierarchical network topologies impacts the ML2 driver APIs and the configuration of deployments that use hierarchical networks, but does not change any REST APIs in any way. A new function and property will be added to the PortContext class in the driver API to enable hierarchical port binding. :: class PortContext(object): # ... @abc.abstractmethod def continue_binding(self, segment_id, next_segments_to_bind): pass @abc.abstractproperty def segments_to_bind(self): pass The new continue_binding() method can be called from within a mechanism driver's bind_port() method as an alternative to the existing set_binding() method. As is currently the case, if a mechanism driver can complete a binding, it calls PortContext.set_binding(segment_id, vif_type, vif_details, status). If a mechanism driver can only partially establish a binding, it will instead call continue_binding(segment_id, next_segments_to_bind). As with set_binding(), the segment_id passed to continue_binding() indicates the segment that this driver is binding to. The new_segments parameter specifies the set of network segments that can be used by the next stage of binding for the port. It will typically contain a dynamically allocated segment that the next driver can use to complete the binding. Currently, mechanism drivers try to bind using the segments from the PortContext.network.network_segments property. These are the network's static segments. The new PortContext.segments_to_bind property should now be used instead by all drivers. For the initial stage of binding, it will contain the same segments as PortContext.network.network_segments. But for subsequent stages, it will contain the segment(s) passed to PortContext.continue_binding() by the previous stage driver as next_segments_to_bind. The ML2 plugin currently tries to bind using all registered mechanism drivers in the order they are specified in the mechanism_drivers config variable. To support hierarchical binding, a new port_binding_drivers configuration variable is added that specifies the sets of drivers that can be used to establish port bindings. :: port_binding_drivers = [openvswitch, hyperv, myfabric+{openvswitch|hyperv}] With this example, ML2 will first try binding using just the openvswitch driver. If that fails it will try the hyperv driver. If neither of these can bind, it will try to bind using the myfabric driver. If the myfabric driver partially bindings (calling PortContext.continue_binding()), then ML2 will try to complete the binding using the openvswitch driver, and if that can't complete it, the hyperv driver. When port_binding_drivers has the default empty value, the mechanism_drivers value is used instead, with each registered driver treated as a separate single item chain. Alternatives ------------ We originally considered supporting dynamic VLANs by allowing the (single) bound mechanism driver to provide arbitrary data to be returned to the L2 agent via the get_device_details RPC. This approach was ruled out because it requires a single mechanism driver to support both the ToR switch and the specific L2 agent on the compute node. This would require separate drivers for each possible combination of ToR mechanism (switch) and compute node mechanism (L2 agent). The approach described in this specification avoids this combinatorial explosion by binding separate mechanism drivers at each level. Data model impact ----------------- Whether the data model is impacted remains to be determined. If the ML2 plugin only nees to store the details of the final stage of the binding, then no change should be needed. But if it needs to store details of all levels, the ml2_port_bindings table schema will need to be modified. If we need to persist all levels of the binding, we need to store the driver name and the bound segment ID for each level. The vif_type and vif_details only apply to the lowest level. The driver and segment columns in the ml2_port_bindings table currently each store a single string, and we need to make sure DB migration preserves already established bindings. We may add columns to store a list of additional binding levels, store partial binding data in a separate table, or possibly redefine the current strings' content to be comma-separated lists if items. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ None. Other deployer impact --------------------- No change is required when deploying non-hierarchical (flat) network topologies. To support hierarchical network topologies, the new port_binding_drivers configuration variable will need to be set to specify the allowable binding driver chains, and all relevant drivers will need to be listed in the mechanism_drivers and type_drivers configuration variables. Developer impact ---------------- Mechanism drivers that support hierarchical bindings will use the additional driver API call(s). Other drivers will only need a very minor update to use PortContext.segments_to_bind in place of PortContext.network.network_segments. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: rkukura Other contributors: asomya Work Items ---------- This specification should not require much code change, so it can probably be implemented as a single patch that contains: 1. Update ML2 DB schema to support multi-level bindings, including migration (if necessary). 2. Update ML2 driver API. 3. Implement multi-level binding logic. 4. Add unit test for multi-level binding. 5. Update existing drivers to use PortContext.segments_to_bind If it does turn out that details of each partial binding need to be persistent, that might be implemented as a separate patch. Dependencies ============ Usage, and possibly testing, depend on implementation of portions of https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/ml2-type-driver-refactor, in order to support dynamic segment allocation. Testing ======= A new unit test will cover the added port binding functionality. No new tempest tests are needed. Third party CI will cover specific mechanism drivers that support dynamic segment allocation. Documentation Impact ==================== The new configuration variables and ML2 driver API changes will need to be documented. Configuration for specific mechanism drivers supporting multi-level binding will be documented by those drivers' vendors. References ========== ",,292,0

Flows seqdiag .. seqdiag:: seqdiag { API -> Neutron [label = ""POST create_network""]; Neutron -> ML2_Plugin [label = ""create_network""]; ML2_Plugin -> Type_Manager [label = ""create_network""]; Type_Manager -> VLAN_Driver [label = ""create_network""]; Type_Manager -> VxLAN_Driver [label = ""create_network""]; Type_Manager <-- VLAN_Driver [label = ""segment""]; Type_Manager <-- VxLAN_Driver [label = ""segment""]; ML2_Plugin <-- Type_Manager [label = ""segments""] Neutron <-- ML2_Plugin [label = ""Network dictionary""]; API <-- Neutron [label = ""Network dictionary""]; } Problem description =================== Currently the ML2 segmentation is managed in multiple places within the architecture: * The plugin invokes the type manager with tenant/provider segment calls. * The manager in turn invokes the type driver to reserve an available/specified segment for the network. * The segment_id if reserved is returned all the way to the plugin which then stores it inside a DB. * The type driver itself also has tables of it’s own where it stores segment details. This model works well for generic segmentation types like vlan, gre etc. But this also makes customizable and extensible type drivers nearly impossible to implement. Use Case -------- A sample use case for this feature is an overlay network with VTEP’s in the hardware layer instead of the soft switch edge. To overcome the 4k VLAN limit a single network can have different segmentation ID’s depending on location in the network. The assumption that a network has fixed segmentation id’s across the deployment doesn’t work with this use case with external controllers that are capable of managing this kind of segmentation. Proposed change =============== * Move all segmentation management to the type driver(s), ML2 plugin and the type manager should only be making calls to the type driver(s) to get segmentation ID’s when required. * Send real API calls, create_network and delete_network to the type driver(s). * Type manager manages distributing and collating replies from various type drivers. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- Extensive data model changes, all type driver DB models will be extended to store the network_id associated with a segment and information regarding provider network segments as well. Existing ML2 DB models will be modified to not store the segmentation id but just the name of the type driver(s) associated with a network. The patch will be accompanied by an Alembic migration to upgrade/downgrade all type driver and ML2 DB models. Need suggestion for generic type driver data migration. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ Instead of storing segmentation id’s in it’s own table, the ML2 plugin will rely on the type drivers returning segment ids. This will result in an extra database call, the ML2 plugin will inspect it’s database to find out the type drivers with segments for the network and then the type manager will call each individual type driver to retrieve segment(s) for that network. The type drivers themselves Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- No API impact. Developers developing new type drivers will have to manage all segmentation within the type driver itself. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Arvind Somya <asomya> Work Items ---------- Single work item. Dependencies ============ None.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================== API Intercept Plugin ==================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/api-intercept-plugin There currently isn't a good place to put complex dynamic policy enforcement in Neutron without modifying the core and service plugins to be policy aware. This spec is to add an option to configure neutron with an API intercept plugin that (if configured) will have all of the API requests routed through it before being sent to the core and service plugins. Problem description =================== There currently isn't a central place to enforce dynamic policy decisions on API requests that come into Neutron. The policy.json file is good for making decisions about API requests based on privileges the requesting user has on the target objects. However, it lacks the ability to base policy on complex conditions such as relationships between the object being modified and existing objects. For example, there currently is no central place to enforce a policy that states that a firewall rule or security group rule permitting DB traffic is not installed unless the source address is restricted to a specific set of CIDRs. This would require modifications to the core plugin as well as the FWaaS service plugin. Additionally, once the policy changes, there is nothing to trigger a cleanup or creation of resources without making the core plugin policy aware. Proposed change =============== As an experimental approach to allow a policy plugin to restrict API operations, this specification proposes a pluggable API interceptor. The configured intercept plugin will receive any API requests to the core and service plugins via the neutron manager. It will then be able to enforce policies on those requests before delegating them to the core and service plugins. This approach allows a separation of concerns by making the core and service plugins oblivous to any complex policy enforcement and the API intercept plugin oblivous to the implementation specifics of provisioning ports, networks, etc. If an API intercept plugin is not configured, requests will simply be handled in the current manner. Request Flow without Intercept Plugin:: +----------+ Core Reqs +----------+ | +---------------------+ Core | | API | | Plugin | | +-----------------+ +----------+ +----------+ Svc Reqs | | +----------+ | | Service | +---+ Plugin(s)| +----------+ Request Flow with Intercept Plugin:: +----------+ Core Reqs +------------+ +----------+ | +----------------+ API | | Core | | API | | Intercept +--------+ Plugin | | +----------------+ Plugin |----+ +----------+ +----------+ Svc Reqs +------------+ | | +----------+ | | Service | +---+ Plugin(s)| +----------+ The target implementation of this intercept plugin will be the group policy plugin. However, as part of this patch, a simple logging and dummy plugin will be added to provide an example and something to use for unit testing. Overall, this should require a relatively minor change to the neutron manager to reconfigure the core and service plugin references to point to the API intercept plugin. Alternatives ------------ Make the core and service plugins policy aware by including all of the policy check code directly in the plugins. This approach would make the core and service plugins complex and tightly coupled since they would be responsible for enforcing a global policy between each other. Data model impact ----------------- This should have no visible impact to the data model since this just allows requests to be intercepted in a plugin. Individual intercept plugins may change the data model, but that is beyond the scope of this specification. REST API impact --------------- This plugin framework will not modify the schema of the REST API. A specific plugin may modify the REST API depending on the policy it is enforcing, but that is beyond the scope of this specification. Security impact --------------- Since these intercept plugins will always be sitting behind the normal API policy.json enforcement, there should be no loss of security. They may add additional checks, but they will not circumvent the current checks. Notifications impact -------------------- N/A Other end user impact --------------------- If the intercept plugin is being used to enforce strict policies, the user may receive more error messages when trying to perform operations not permitted by the intercept plugin. Performance Impact ------------------ If no API intercept plugin is configured, there will be no performance impact. If one is configured, the impact will largely depend on what the plugin checks for every request. Other deployer impact --------------------- The deployers will have to specify an API intercept plugin in the same way they specify the core and service plugins if they want to use one. Developer impact ---------------- N/A Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Other contributors: Work Items ---------- * Modify neutron manager to make API intercept plugin get all API calls * Add dummy and logging plugin for unit tests and example * Modify group policy plugin to work as an API intercept plugin Dependencies ============ The last work item will require the group policy plugin. Testing ======= Unit tests will cover all of the change to allow API intercept plugins. Individual plugins (e.g. group policy) may be tested with tempest tests. Documentation Impact ==================== Policy plugins can be configured by the end user using the new API intercept option.

Problem description =================== When the backend controller controls all of the physical and virtual switches, the chosen segmentation ID is irrelevant to Neutron. Since this was the only supported model for the Big Switch plugin, it didn't need the provider net extension to specify segmentation IDs for each network. However, the plugin now needs to support heterogeneous environments containing vswitches under the control of the controller and standalone vswitches controlled by a neutron agent. To support these latter switches, a segmentation ID is required so the agent understands how to configure the VLAN translation to the physical network. Proposed change =============== Implement the provider network extention in the plugin to populate the segmentation ID for vlan networks. Alternatives ------------ N/A. This VLAN information is not available to neutron unless it selects it on its own rather then leaving it up to the fabric. Data model impact ----------------- N/A REST API impact --------------- Port and network responses for admins will contain segmentation information.

Problem description =================== The group policy to legacy network object mappings make it difficult for the backend controller to understand the intent of the original policy since it only receives the resulting port/subnet/network creation calls. This prevents it from making optimizations about grouping and enforcement that perform better on the fabric than the standard subnet/network groups. Proposed change =============== Create a new group policy driver that will communicate directly with a group policy API on the Big Switch controllers rather than rely on the mapping to standard Neutron objects. This allows the backend to make decisions about how to implement the grouping based on fabric optimizations. Alternatives ------------ Rely on the default GP mapping driver that converts endpoint groups into standard neutron objects. This does not let the controller perform grouping optimizations that work better for the network hardware.

Problem description =================== The Group Based Policy (GBP) blueprint has proposed new application centric APIs for Neutron. In order to utilize these new APIs with SDN-VE, it is necessary to provide the driver for implementing and proxying the new GBP APIs to SDN-VE. Proposed change =============== We propose the addition of a new driver in the context of the GBP service plugin to support the implementation the GPB API by using SDN-VE. Alternatives ------------ One possible option is not utilizing the GBP service plugin framework and either provide a new service plugin to be use by either the monolithic or the ML2 based SDN-VE driver. Another alternative is to add the support for the GBP extension in the monolithic SDN-VE. Considering that reusing the GBP service plugin will reduce code replication and significantly reduce the cost of maintaining the code, the alternative options do not seem cost effective. Data model impact ----------------- None, as this change is simply adding support for new API extensions. REST API impact --------------- The new GBP API extensions are supported.

This creates strange side effects when importing the plugin from the ML2 agent when database modules are loaded. The Big Switch modules need to be separated out better to prevent these cases and to cleanly express what is shared between the ML2 driver and the plugin. Problem description =================== Importing the Big Switch plugin from the Big Switch ML2 driver requires some ugly hacks since it causes all of the Big Switch plugin DB modules to be imported.[1] This very tight integration makes updating the ML2 driver or the plugin a delicate process because we have to make sure one doesn't break the other.

Freescale Firewall Service Plugin proxies ReSTful calls (formatted for CRD Service) from Neutron to CRD Service. It supports the Cloud Resource Discovery (CRD) service by updating the Firewall related data (rules, policies and firewall) into the CRD database. CRD service manages creation of firewall on network nodes, virtual network appliances and openflow controller network applications. Problem description =================== Neutron Firewall information (like rules, policies and firewall) is requried by CRD service to manage Firewall deployment in virtual network appliances and openflow controller apps. In order to send this information from neutron, a new firewall service plugin is required to post the data to CRD service. Proposed change =============== The basic work flow is as shown below. :: +-------------------------------+ | | | Neutron Service | | | | +--------------------------+ | | | | | Freescale Firewall | | | Service Plugin | | | | +----+-----------+--------------+ | | ReST API | | +---------v-----------+ | | | CRD Service | | | +---------------------+ Freescale Firewall Service plugin sends the Firewall related data to CRD server. The plug-in implements the CRUD operation on the following entities: * Firewall Rules * Firewall Policies * Firewall The plug-in uses the exisitng firewall database to store the firewall data. Sequence flow of events for create_firewall is as follows: :: create_firewall { neutron -> fsl_fw_plugin fsl_fw_plugin -> crd_service fsl_fw_plugin <-- crd_service neutron <-- fsl_fw_plugin } Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- No existing models are changed and new models are created. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ Negligible or None Other deployer impact --------------------- This change doesn't take immediate effect. To work with the change, neutron need to be configured with fsl_firewall for service_plugins. The following configuration changes are reruired to enable this plugin. In [DEFAULT] section of /etc/neutron/neutron.conf modify 'service_plugins' attribute as, :: service_plugins = fsl_firewall Update /etc/neutron/plugins/services/firewall/fsl_firewall.ini, as below. :: [fsl_fwaas] crd_auth_strategy = keystone crd_url = http://127.0.0.1:9797 crd_auth_url = http://127.0.0.1:5000/v2.0/ crd_tenant_name = service crd_password = <-service-password-> crd_user_name = <-service-username-> CRD service must be running in the Controller. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: trinath-somanchi Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- - Freescale firewall service plugin (fsl_firewall_plugin.py) Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= * Complete unit test coverage of the code is included. * For tempest test coverage, third party testing is provided. * The Freescale CI reports on all changes affecting this Plugin. * The testing is run in a setup with an OpenStack deployment (devstack) connected to a active CRD server.

Problem description =================== If there is any inconsistency in the state of neutron and the VSD database, there is no way to sync the resources between them. Proposed change =============== The proposed change is to introduce support for state synchronization between neutron and VSD in the Nuage plugin In case Nuage VSD loses its database or the database is restored using a backup copy, there is a possibility that the resources in Neutron and VSD are not in sync and this can lead to unexpected behavior. The sync will run as a part of Nuage plugin and will detect the “out of sync” scenario by comparing the state. Neutron is always the master. If there are less resources on VSD as compared to Neutron, the sync logic will create those resources on VSD. Assumption: 1. If the resource exists in VSD, all of its attributes are in sync with the corresponding Neutron resource. 2. There will never be a case where Neutron has fewer resources than VSD.

However, in the current implementation (version i), booting up a large number of homogeneous VMs is time-consuming. To overcome this drawback, we propose a lightweight patch for Nova, which adopts a third-party library, called VMThunder, for fast booting homogeneous VMs. VMThunder accelerates the booting process through on-demand data transfer in a P2P manner. Problem description =================== Currently, Openstack provides two categories of methods for booting a virtual machine: (i) booting from a local image or (ii) booting from a remote Cinder volume. The first category needs to copy the entire image to a compute node, making it suffer from a long transfer delay for large images. The second category remotely attaches a volume to a VM and transfers only the necessary data from the volume, thus having better performance. However, this approach only allows booting a single VM from a volume at a time. Moreover, preparing a volume for each VM requires a long time. As a result, it is currently inevitable to take a long time for booting a large number of homogeneous VMs in Openstack. Proposed change =============== We propose to add a new method, named ""Boot from VMThunder"", for fast booting multiple homogeneous VMs. This method uses a third-party library (VMThunder) to support simultaneous booting of a large number of VMs. VMThunder configures each VM with two volumes (the figure can be found here http://www.kylinx.com/vmthunder/vmthunder.png): a (read-only) template volume exactly the same as the pre-created original volume and a (writable) snapshot volume storing each VM¡¯s difference to the template. The original volume is the root of a template volume relay tree, and each VM fetches only the necessary data from its parent over the multi-path iSCSI protocol. In addition, VMThunder makes use of a compute node¡¯s local storage as a cache to accelerate the image transferring process and avoid a repetitive data transfer. The P2P-style, on-demand data transfer dramatically accelerates VMs' booting process. Our modification to Nova is light-weighted (about 80 lines of insertions/deletions). Two major functions, i.e., the creation and deletion of the template and snapshot volumes, are implemented as following: (i) creation: We add a volume-driver class (about 50 lines, depends on VMThunder¡¯s API) in file ""nova/virt/block_device.py"" to prepare the template and snapshot volumes. (ii) deletion: We add a delete method (about 20 lines, depends on VMThunder¡¯s API) in file ""nova/compute/manager.py' to destroy the unused template and snapshot volumes. More details of the implementation can be found in the following links: Paper, http://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/td/preprint/06719385.pdf Modification diff file, http://www.kylinx.com/vmthunder/diff2.txt VMThunder demo videos, http://www.kylinx.com/vmthunder/boot_vmthunder_win7_success-V2.mp4 Image booting demo videos, http://www.kylinx.com/vmthunder/boot_image_test_win7_success-V2.mp4 Alternatives ------------ (1)Image cache: Nova's image-caching facility reduces the start-up time for creating homogeneous virtual machines on one nova-compute node. However, it helps neither the first-time provisioning nor the Cinder-based booting process. (2)P2P transferring: The P2P protocol can increase the speed of the file distribution. For example, the glance-bittorrent-delivery proposal transfers the image templates from the glance storage to Nova-compute servers. This approach, however, needs to transfer the entire image to all peers. (3)Backend storage optimization: The distributed storages like NFS, cluster FS, distributed FS or SAN can decrease the size of transferred volumes. However, the I/O pressure on the storage servers increases dramatically when powering on a large number of homogeneous VMs, since there may not be enough replicas on the storage servers for offloading the I/O demands. (4)Multi-attach volume: (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Cinder/blueprints/multi-attach-volume) This approach allows a volume to be attached to more than one instance simultaneously. As a result, volumes can be shared among multiple guests when the instances are already available. Besides, these volumes can also be used for booting a number of VMs by enforcing the multi-attach volumes as read-only image disks. Unfortunately, this approach does not scale well because of the star-structured topology in the data dissemination process. (5)Direct image access: (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/nova-image-zero-copy). This approach uses the direct_url of the Glance v2 API, such that the number of needed hops to transfer an image to a Nova-compute node is decreased. When images are stored at multiple backend locations, the Nova-compute servers can select a proper image storage for speeding up the downloading process.

Problem description =================== Internet service providers want to be able to deploy their network infrastructure as virtual machines in an OpenStack cloud. Currently they need to choose between high-performance with SR-IOV or high flexibility with Linux kernel networking. Some network operators require both at the same time, and this is the problem that Snabb NFV solves. Specifically, Deutsche Telekom have this problem for the TeraStream network and want to deploy Neutron with Snabb NFV as the solution. (TeraStream overview: http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/deutsche-telekom-terastream-designed.html) Proposed change =============== To add a very simple mechanism driver for Snabb NFV to the ML2 plugin. The mechanism driver will only implement port binding callbacks. Portbinding will assign selected ports to VIF_SNABB and assist with scheduling them onto suitable hosts and ports. This mechanism driver does not access Neutron database contents for networks, ports, and subnets. Instead, Snabb NFV software accesses the Neutron database by independent (out of tree) means. Alternatives ------------ This blueprint is designed to minimize the amount of new code that has to be introduced into the Neutron tree. One alternative would be to bring all or part of the Snabb NFV software directly into the Neutron tree. However, OpenStack and Snabb NFV are likely to benefit from being developed separately, as with other projects including OpenDaylight, OVS, and OVS-DB. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ Snabb NFV is expected to substantially outperform the standard ML2 reference implementation. This expectation is based on the use of a poll-mode data-plane (like DPDK) and because much processing is offloaded onto NIC hardware including L2 switching, QoS, and packet filtering. Other deployer impact --------------------- Snabb NFV requires Intel 10G network adapters on compute hosts. The roadmap includes adding support for one additional network vendor during the Juno cycle. The deployer must configure: * HOST:PHYSICAL-NETWORK:PCI-ADDRESS mapping that specifies which provider physical networks will be implemented with Snabb NFV and which PCI network devices will be used on each host. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Luke Gorrie <lukego> Work Items ---------- 1. ML2 mech driver for creating VIF_SNABB ports. 2. Portbinding logic for scheduling ports onto suitable hosts based on connectivity and QoS requirements. 3. Support QoS blueprint (if/when merged). 4. Support ML2 Extensions blueprint (if/when merged). Dependencies ============ Hard dependencies: 1. Nova VIF_SNABB driver support. (Blueprint to be filed.) VIF_SNABB will be implemented based on the new QEMU vhost-user feature: http://www.virtualopensystems.com/en/solutions/guides/snabbswitch-qemu/. vhost-user is expected to be merged into QEMU and Libvirt early in the Juno cycle. Soft dependencies that will be used if available: 1. Neutron QoS API extension: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/quantum-qos-api 2. Support for extensions in ML2 mechanism drivers: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/neutron-ml2-mechanismdriver-extensions * This will be used to ensure that relevant extensions are enabled: provider networks, security groups, and QoS. Testing ======= The code will be covered by unit tests. Third party tempest tests will be provided for CI. Documentation Impact ==================== Configuration Reference guide will be updated from the code.

This reverts commit c3191cf0ba5ad3dc2df8da2a2bf5c9d270fde9d9.

The change needs to be thought out some more, i.e. why isn't
compute_api.get_all just loading up the image_ref value on the instance
object rather than calling a helper method from the servers extension to
the instance object which just calls back to compute_api, seems very
roundabout, plus isn't it a v3 API issue also?

The image locations table stores the swift url for images
which includes the user and key values. This if exposed,
can cause security risk. Hence this patch, santizies
that information out of the location before storing
and plugs it back in when it is required.
Introduced a new configuration file that supports
multiple swift account references. It has the credentials and
authurl for each store.  It is specified using
'swift_store_config_file'.
In addition, this patch does the following things:

Differentiate user and system created swift location

Currently we do not differentiate between user created
locations and system created locations that have the account
reference. This patch introduces new scheme:
'swift+config' for this purpose.

Image create in V1 should validate the uri

This patch ensures that a store is not set while
creating an image or updating it.

This commit introduces loadbalancer instance into LBaaS API,
object model, driver interface, unit tests.
The purpose of LB instance:
1) envelope other main balancer resources such as vips and pools
That is needed to retain loadbalancer configuration as a tree
instead of a graph when multiple pools-vips relationship is
introduced. So Loadbalancer object becomes the root of the tree
instead of the Pool
2) Provide clear boundaries for loadbalancer configuration.
All objects that belong to one loadbalancer are deployed to one
device or agent and are handled with the same provider (driver)
3) Loadbalancer object becomes a 'mounting point' of attributes
associated with configuration such as provider, device, agent,
router.

The patch contains the following changes:
 - CRUD operations for loadbalancer resource
 - Autocreation of loadbalancer resource with the pool
 - Autodeletion of loadbalancer resource with vip or pool deletion
 (needed for API compatibility)
 - Corresponding changes in the driver API

Other changes:
 - provider attribute has moved to loadbalancer resource from the pool.
 E.g. provider attribute in the Pool object is deprecated, but returned
 for backward compatibility.
 - NiciraServicePlugin was fixed in order to preserve backward
compatibility of LBaaS API of Nicira Plugin

after the supplier info update which added columns that would be null
for existing packages. Patch returns None from the JSON deserializer
in that case, and also refactors unittest base classes.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== ML2 Mechanism Driver for Cisco UCS Manager ========================================== URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/ml2-ucs-manager-mechanism-driver The purpose of this blueprint is to add support for Cisco UCS Manager into Openstack Neutron. This plugin for Cisco UCS Manager is implemented as a ML2 plugin. Problem description =================== A detailed description of the problem: 1. Initially this mechanism driver will be used to configure Cisco Vm-Fex on specific Cisco NICs while maintianing port profiles for these virtual functions(VFs) on the UCS Manager. 2. Port profiles created/managed by this mechanism driver are then used by Nova to configure 802.1Qbh in the VMs domain XML file. (Not in the scope of this BP.) 3. In addition, this mechanism driver can also be used to configure SR-IOV on specific Cisco and Intel NICs (without using port profiles). The ML2 based mechanism driver will interact with Cisco UCS Manager via UCS specific Python SDK. Proposed change =============== PCI passthrough and SR-IOV ports do not have a corresponding entity on the hypervisor. So, it is important that no L2 agent binds these ports. This ml2 mechanism driver takes care of binding the above mentioned PCI passthrough and SR-IOV virtual functions (VFs)that belong to specific Cisco and Intel NICs. The mechanism driver is also responsible for configuring and maintaining Port Profiles for the Openstack virtual functions on the UCS manager. The port profile is required to completely configure VMFex on Cisco NICs using UCS manager. However, we did not want the tenant to be exposed to this vendor specific concept. To take care of this situation, the ML2 driver creates or re-uses a port profile behind the scenes using relavant information from the network (vlan-id) on which the vm-fex port is configured. Alternatives ------------ ML2 mechanism drivers are preferred over monolithic plugins in Neutron. Data model impact ----------------- One new data model is created by this driver to keep track of port profiles created by Openstack. Other port profiles can exist on the UCS Manager that this driver does not care about. PortProfile: Tracks the vlan-id associated with a given port profile and the VF that is currently configured with this PortProfile. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- No user impact. As mentioned earlier, did not want to expose the port profile_id to the user since this is a verndor specific entity. Instead, managing allocation of port profiles internally within the driver. Performance Impact ------------------ The ML2 driver code would have to conditionally communicate with the UCS Manager to configure, update or delete port profiles and associated configuration. These tasks would have a performance impact on Neutron's responsiveness to a command that affects port config. Other deployer impact --------------------- The deployer must provide the following in order to be able to connect to a UCS Manager. 1. IP address of UCS Manager 2. Admin Username and password to log into UCS Manager. 3. Add ""cisco_ucsm"" as a ML2 driver to handle SR-IOV port configuration. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Sandhya Dasu <sadasu> Work Items ---------- Work Items can be roughly divided into the following tasks: 1. Mechanism driver handles port create, update and delete requests. 2. Network driver handles communication with UCS manager. This communication is triggered by an operation peformed on a port by the mechanism driver. 3. Unit test cases to test the mechanism driver and network driver code. 4. Tempest test cases to peform end-to-end and functional testing of 1 and 2. Dependencies ============ 1. This mechanism driver depends on third party UCS python SDK (located at : https://github.com/CiscoUcs/UcsPythonSDK) to communicate with the UCS Manager. 2. For SR-IOV ports to be actually scheduled and assigned to a VM, some non-vendor specific Nova code is required. This effort is tracked via: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/pci-passthrough-sriov Testing ======= Third party tempest testing will be provided for this mechanism driver. Cisco CI will start reporting on all changes affecting this driver. The third party tempest tests will run on a setup which runs Openstack (devstack) code on a multi-node setup that is connected to a UCS Manager system. Documentation Impact ==================== Details of configuring this mechanism driver.

This work has previously been tracked in bug/832507 as well as bp/fix-libvirt-console-logging. What's broken? -------------- libvirt console logging has been through a number of iterations. First off we had a FIFO that libvirt wrote to, and which the nova driver then read and logged to disk. This worked nicely, untime we discovered that libvirt would block writing to the named pipe the FIFO was implemented with if there was no one reading from the pipe. For example, if nova-compute was restarted on a hypervisor node, then instances writing to the console would pause waiting for nova-compute to come back. This made us sad. As a quick fix, we moved to using libvirt file logging for the console. This is the simplest option in libvirt, and therefore very reliable. libvirt just writes whatever is written to the console to a path we specify on disk, and we can use that file to return console log information to users. There are a few problems here though: - initially we would return the entire contents of this log file to users when they requested the console log of an instance. This was a problem for very large log files, where we found that rabbitmq would stop responding when we tried to send a 1gb message back to the caller. We've ""fixed"" this by having the driver limit the amount of information it is willing to return, and only returning the last N bytes of the log file. - however, this hasn't stopped the unbounded growth of these log files on disk. Its entirely possible to see log files that are bigger than a gigabyte, and this can be unexpected for operators. [1] What's the fix? --------------- In order to resolve this problem once and for all it was decided at the Havana design summit to move to using a unix domain socket for console logging. This has the advantages of the named pipe technique, without the annoying stall behaviour if there's no one around to read the console logs. If nova-compute isn't running, console output is simply discarded until it returns. This isn't perfect, but its better than a stall. This was implemented in review https://review.openstack.org/#/c/47634/ for Havana. Unfortunately, it was noticed very late in the review cycle that there were some filesystem permissions concerns with this implementation and it never landed. You can see the review discussion around these issues in: - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/39048/ - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/43099/ - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/46645/ - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/46873/ These reviews also implemented a simple rolling set of console log files in the instance directory. Files of the form console.log.<<num>> were written, and output moved to a new file when the current one reached a configured size. Older files could then be reaped as desired. File system permissions you say? -------------------------------- One problem with the unix domain socket approach is that the libvirt processes and the nova-compute process both need to be able to read and write [2] to the file that is the unix domain socket. It is hard for nova to know what permissions to apply to the unix domain socket to make this possible, as we don't know what user libvirt will run as (or if its even in the same group as the user running nova-compute). The initial implementation simply set the permissions of the domain socket to 777 on the theory that if you had access to the hypervisor node, then pretty much all bets are off anyway. Reviewers weren't happy with this for obvious reasons. The proposed alternative is a small binary that is run by rootwrap. This binary could be the thing that reads from the unix domain socket and manages the console log files on disk. For convenience, it is proposed that there be one of these binaries per instance. Because the code that reads from the unix domain sockets uses select() to decide to read, the expense of running multiple copies of this binary should be low. Lifecycle of the helper binary ------------------------------ - instance boot: the helper binary is started - instance delete: the helper binary is killed - instance migration: the helper binary is started on the destination and killed on the source - nova-compute startup: for each running instance ensure there is a copy of the helper running (probably by checking for processes which have the unix domain socket file open) Could this helper binary be more generic? ----------------------------------------- I can think of other uses for a per instance helper binary. I don't really want to implement them as part of this blueprint, but they're options for the future. Some ideas: - block migration of instances where the base image is no longer present in glance currently fail (bug/1206887). There's an option in libvirt to convert the disk on the source hypervisor node to not require a base image, but it is expensive and would cause a long pause of the instance. What if instead we could stream the base image from the source to the destination hypervisor nodes before performing the block migration? - block migration currently doesn't migrate the console log to the new hypervisor node (bug/1203193). This confuses operators and users. Similarly to above, the helper process could stream the console log to the destination hypervisor node before running the block migration. This is a little more complicated however, because it stands the risk of missing log messages emitted after the streaming but before the instance pause. We could handle this by forcing log file rotation before streaming and before migration and streaming any missing files. - the communication provided by unix domain sockets console logging is bi-directional and having bi-directional communication between a console of an instance and the helper is actually sort of cool. For example, it means we could expose interactive serial consoles to users in a manner similar to the current VNC console functionality. I would think that this would be in the form of a paramiko based SSH server running out of the helper that could authenticate users via the SSH key registered for an instance. This ssh server would be proxied to in a manner similar to what we do for VNC now. However, I see this as a secondary problemt to solving the operational concerns with console logging. The way forward --------------- It is proposed to revive the patches from Havana against Juno trunk. This probably involves a fair bit of rework because of the drift in the codebase during Icehouse. The console management code will then be split out into the new helper binary. Testing ------- Tempest tests should be added to ensure the helper binaries start and stop as expected. Who would do this work? ----------------------- Michael Still is the author of this blueprint and intends to persue implementation in Juno. Footnotes --------- 1: as an aside, console logs are not moved to new hypervisor nodes during live migration, so if you're seeing this in production one option would be to live migrate instances with very large console log files. 2: testing indicates that both in fact need to be able to write to the file, even though the nova-compute process does not currently write to the domain socket.",,157,0

As nuage strive to add more features and functionality to its monolithic plugin, it is important from other integration point of view to also support ml2 mechanism driver framework. This is the effort to start achieving that goal. Proposed change =============== In Juno release, mechanism driver will support basic L2 functionality as a stepping stone to enhance it in later release. It will implement CRUD APIs for network, subnets and ports. Idea is to reuse as much of the code base from the current monolithic plugin itself and for that reason driver class will inherit nuage plugin class as one of the parent. Alternatives ------------ Monolithic Nuage Plugin Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== In order for mechanism driver to talk to Nuage's VSD, it will require certain configuration to be read from the file. This is similar approach to nuage's monolithic plugin. Along with parameters mentioned at etc/neutron/plugins/nuage/nuage_plugin.ini, user will have to pass reference to precreated net-partition as well. Once https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/neutron-ml2-mechanismdriver-extensions is implemented (if at all), will add support for it in next release.

Currently, when attaching volumes, the Hyper-V driver selects the
slot on the SCSI controller by using the number of drives
attached to that controller.

This leads to exceptions when detaching volumes having lower
numbered slots and then attaching a new volume, as Hyper-V will
then try to use an occupied slot.

This patch fixes the issue by simply getting a list of used slots
and getting a slot that it's not among those. It also checks
for the slot number to be smaller than the maximum number of slots
per SCSI controller.

Fixes bug: #1329764

The following replacements were done in tests to have
clearer messages in case of failure:
- assertTrue(* in *) with assertIn
- assertTrue(* not in *) with assertNotIn
- assertFalse(* in *) with assertNotIn

assertTrue/False with custom error messages weren't
replaced because assertIn/NotIn doesn't have argument
'message' and we'll lose error messages if we replace it.

Also assertTrue/False with operator 'any' were
replaced with more simpler asserts assertIn/NotIn.

This patch just adds a tiny bit more info to give us

Second, add a warning message prior to getting to that

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ====================================== Use OVSDB instead of calling ovs-vsctl ====================================== Problem description =================== Neutron's ovs_lib uses the Open vSwitch CLI command *ovs-vsctl* to perform basic vSwitch CRUD operations. This is almost an order of magnitude slower than using either direct OVSDB protocol commands, or using the Open vSwitch Python API. In addition, using the CLI commands make it easy to misunderstand the asynchronous nature of some Open vSwitch operations. For example: ovs_lib.OVSBridge.add_port() runs *ovs-vsctl add-port* then returns the value returned by OVSBridge.get_port_ofport, which calls *ovs-vsctl get Interface ${ifname} ofport*. Open vSwitch does not assign the ofport inside a transaction, leading to a race condition where ofport may or may not be set, even though the port creation was successful. Using the proper APIs would make problems like the above easier to realize. In addition, relying on the parsing of CLI output which is intended to be human readable is both non-performant and brittle. Proposed change =============== Leaving the actual ovs_lib API largely unchanged, we should replace calls to ovs-vsctl with the upstream Open vSwitch Python API calls. On a simple test creating and deleting 100 ports on an existing bridge, the current ovs_lib implementation was 6-7x slower than using the OVS Python API. It should be noted that ovs_lib was over 100x slower than sending raw OVSDB commands to Open vSwitch. The performance disparity between the raw OVSDB and existing OVS Python API is due to the poor performance of the OVS Python API's own pure-Python JSON parser which tests show to be ~30x slower than Python's stdlib JSON parser which, unfortuanately, is not a good fit for OVS's use case as it is a pull-parser. Significant potential speedups are possible in OVS's JSON parser by writing an extension that wraps adds Python bindings to the C version of their parser. The OVS Python API's IDL implementation may need to be subclassed to provide a hook for being able to take the update notifications it receives so that we can use those to automatically update the OVS Plugin. Alternatives ------------ It would be possible to write our own library around the OVSDB protocol. It would most likely be faster, but it would most likely end up looking very much like the OVS Python API by the time we were finished. Data model impact ----------------- n/a REST API impact --------------- n/a Security impact --------------- The existing implementation handles privileges via sudo/rootwrap. The proposed change would be using a programatic API and would instead rely on the appropriate permissions being set on underlying Open vSwitch unix domain socket or through the use of Open vSwitch's SSL authentication. Notifications impact -------------------- n/a Other end user impact --------------------- n/a Performance Impact ------------------ With no changes to the upstream OVS Python API, a 6-7x speed improvement is possible. With Python bindings to the OVS C JSON parser, it should be possible to approach the native OVSDB protocol performance which was 100x faster than the current ovs_lib. Other deployer impact --------------------- Repeating from the Security section, deployers would have to ensure that the *neutron* user has r/w permissions to the Open vSwitch db.sock. A new config option specifying the connection string for ovs-server would also be required. Packagers will need to add a dependency for python-openvswitch (which seems to be readily available across common distributions as it is part of standard openvswitch packaging). Developer impact ---------------- For the initial implementation, there shouldn't be any change to ovs_lib's public-facing API, though many of the unit tests will have to be changed because they are tied far too heavily to specific implementation details, mocking out calls to ovs-vsctl, etc. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- otherwiseguy Work Items ---------- * Convert existing OVS unit tests that deal entirely with external Open vSwitch actions to functional tests. * Convert existing ovs-vsctl calls to the equivalent OVS Python API calls * Re-work OVSDB Monitoring to use the OVS Python API Dependencies ============ Adds a requirement for the OVS python bindings Testing ======= Existing tempest tests should be useful, but most of the ovs_lib unit tests will need to be removed as they don't test anything but the implementation details. Functional tests that actually test the CRUD operations against a real Open vSwitch installation should be created. Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation of the new config option and security considerations will be necessary.

The current cloning process in the LVM
driver uses a snapshot to do the data
copy in the background.  Trouble here
is that if the creation or activation
of the new volume fails, we don't
cleanup the snapshot we created.

Just move the create_volume and activate
calls down into the try block so the finally
clause can do the cleanup for us.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =========================================================== Reorganize neutron migrations (Once they've been 'healed') =========================================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/reorganize-migrations A good chunk of current migrations apply only to certain plugins making them configuration-dependent. A migration path dependent on configuration poses a serious upgrade problem. The Neutron DB is being restructured in a way that the DB schema will always be the same regardless of Neutron's configuration. For this reason, logic for handling configuration-dependent migrations should go; similarly configuration dependent migrations should be made 'independent'. Possibly they should also be squashed so that by reducing the overall number of migration we might be able to speed up DB ugrade process. The work described in this blueprint relies on the Neutron DB healing blueprint, whose spec can be found at: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/95738/ Problem description =================== There are currently 215 migrations in Neutron's DB upgrade path. A migration often applies only to certain plugins, and is skipped if currently neutron is configured with a different plugin. This creates a serious upgrade problem. As an example, the devstack job for Neutron for testing an upgrade from havana to icehouse fails because the 'metering' service plugin is specified only in the icehouse configuration; however since it was introduced in havana, some fundamental migrations to make it work where skipped. Hence the upgrade fails as soon as the first migration touching metering DB models is encountered. This problem is already being dealt with by ""healing"" neutron DB schema in a way such that its end state will be the same regardless of conf values. Nevertheless, there a few more things to take care of: * Existing DB migrations which apply to specific plugins must become plugin-agnostic * The logic for handling plugin-specific migrations should go in order to prevent plugin-specific migration from being pushed in the future. Proposed change =============== The proposed change is rather simple: remove the logic for skipping migrations according to the current configuration, and make all migrations ""global"". As this blueprint looks back at the whole migration history, which stretches back to folsom, this is also a good chance to coalesce this rather long path by squashing intra-release migrations together, and removing from the path versions which are now not anymore supported. For instance, the revised path could: 1) Start at Havana Release 2) Have a single, configuration-independent, migration to Icehouse 3) Resume the 'traditional' path from Icehoue up to trunk, ensuring that all migrations in this path become however configuration-independent This new migration path MUST ensure correct operation of upgrade/downgrades from Havana to Icehouse. To this aim, this change will introduce: * a new 'Havana' initial state. This will be independent from configuration * a single idempotent migration to/from Icehouse * a healing step immediately before icehouse on downgrade direction. This is for ensuring the database is in a healed state as the new migration to Havana will have this assumptions. Being the healing migration idempotent, this should not be a problem. NOTE: If there is consensus to keep allowing users running unsupported releases to upgrade to Icehouse directly then initial statuses for Folsom and Grizzly might be kept. Alternatives ------------ One alternative would be to leave everything as it is at the moment, and add a test (integrated with flake8) to prevent new plugin-dependent migrations from being added to the path; Also the check for asessing whether a migration should be executed or skipped will be bypassed. This should work, but it will still leave us with a lot of plugin-specific migrations which might confuse users. Also, there will be leftover, unused code in the source tree which will eventually end up bitrotting. Data model impact ----------------- The migration path up to Havana will be removed. This can be substitude with Grizzly if there is an agreement to provide users running the now unsupported Grizzly to uprade to a more recent release. Intra-release migrations between Havana and Icehouse (and possibly between Grizzly and Havana) will be squashed into a single migration. REST API impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- Nonw Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ If migrations are squashed, upgrade will obviously be faster. No impact for runtime performance. Other deployer impact --------------------- Operators which already already running havana should be able to upgrade to icehouse without any problem. For operators running Icehouse, Havana downgrade should be smooth, both if they executed or not already the 'healing' migration. Operators running versions prior to Havana might still be supported, if versions older than Havana are kept in the migration path. Developer impact ---------------- It will be no longer possible to create plugin-specific migrations. Implementation ============== In rough terms we might expect a first step where the migration logic is removed, and all migrations made independent of configuration. In a second step instead a new initial state will be defined and intra-release migrations prior to Icehouse will be squashed. Assignee(s) ----------- Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: salvatore-orlando Other contributors: Anybody else who wants to participate Work Items ---------- Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation. Dependencies ============ DB migration refactoring is a prerequisite for this blueprint. https://review.openstack.org/#/c/95738/ Testing ======= No additional tests should be added. Instead, some unit tests concerning plugin-specific migrations might be removed. Existing grenade tests should be enough to validate the new upgrade path.

Problem description =================== Brocade Hardaware supports SVI (Switch Virtual Interface) which provides ASIC level routing/gateway functionality in the switch for configured VLANs. This Service plugin provides support for this feature for line rate routing/gateway functionality. Please see definition of SVI in the references section of this document. Proposed change =============== This proposal will introduce a Layer 3 service plugin which will interface with the VDX switch using NETCONF. NETCONF interface on the switch will be used to program the SVI on the switch. From the Neutron API perspective the following calls in the service plugin will be added: * Create a router * Update a router * Delete a router * Add a new router interface * Remove a router interface This plugin works in conjuction with Brocade ML2 Driver which will continue to manage networks, subnets, and ports. Alternatives ============ The alternative approach is to use the open source agent based layer 3 router plugin and update the L3 agent to interact with Arista Hardware. Data model impact ================= In the Brocade specific DB a table will be added to track the SVI created on a tenant basis. Mapping of the SVI to the VLAN will also be provided. REST API impact =============== none Security impact =============== none Notifications impact ==================== none Other end user impact ===================== none Performance Impact ================== There are no changes to any existing code patterns, hence there is no significant change in performance profile. Instead of software L3 service this provides the same service using the VDX hardware. NETCONF requests to the switch may add a very slight change to the execution of the API but we expect this change to be minor and will affect only setups depolying this hardware based functionality.

Brocade will provide Third-Party tempest code coverage of this functionality. This will be implemented as a CI (continuous integration) Testing.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =============================================== Support for extensions in ML2 Mechanism Drivers =============================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/neutron-ml2-mechanismdriver-extensions Need to include extensions defined by mechanism driver in Ml2Plugin. Problem description =================== In current Ml2Plugin implementation, only extensions defined in Ml2Plugin is loaded and there is no support for mechanism driver to have their own extensions and load them when needed. Proposed change =============== The following changes can be considered as a solution to support extensions in mechanism driver: 1. If mechanism driver needs to support any extension, it should add: a) _supported_extension_aliases attribute to its class. b) extension path to the api_extensions_path. 2. Add new method in Ml2Plugin: This new method should go through the order_mech_drivers and if there is any aliases supported, add it to existing list of aliases in the Ml2Plugin that is _supported_extension_aliases. 3. Add new optional method to NeutronPluginBaseV2 (i.e. is_ml2_plugin(self)) for letting user know if the plugin is ML2 or not. Also new extension API should be supported by mechanism driver (i.e. GET/CREATE/UPDATE) as most of the mandatory API are listed in NeutronPluginBaseV2 and each plugin needs to implement them. The new method in NeutronPluginBaseV2 will return True if plugin is ML2, and False otherwise. In Controller object [in neutron/neutron/api/v2/base.py file] where _items is called to get an attribute (setting the obj_getter, for new extension) we will have AttributeError exception as Ml2Plugin does not support an API for the extension. The newly added method to the plugin (is_ml2_plugin()) can be used here to check if the plugin is ML2. If so, the order_mech_drivers can be used the get the attribute from a mechanism drivers object. If no attribute found then raise AttributeError exception. 4. In resource's post/pre_commit method (i.e. network, port, subnet) there is no way for mechanism driver to know the original data passed to the plaugin (for creating the resources). For instance for network resource, when a network is created with an extension attribute in the network parameters, according to the code below, the 'result' and 'mech_context' do not include the extension's attribute. So mechanism driver cannot use the required info passed to the create_network. def create_network(self, context, network): ... net_data = network['network'] <= net_data includes extension ... result = super(Ml2Plugin, self).create_network(context, network) NOTE: The result does not have extension's attribute ... mech_context = driver_context.NetworkContext(self, context, result) NOTE: The mech_context does not have extension's attribute ... self.mechanism_manager.create_network_precommit(mech_context) NOTE: mech_context does not have extension's attribute ... self.mechanism_manager.create_network_postcommit(mech_context) NOTE: mech_context does not have extension's attribute To avoid the issue, a new attribute can be added to NetworkContext (and also for PortContext and SubnetContext) such as prime_network (prime_port and prime_subnet). And it can be set when calling: driver_context.NetworkContext(self, context, result, prime_network=net_data), so that it can be passed to the mechanism driver when call to: self.mechanism_manager.create_network_post/pre_commit(mech_context) is made.

Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= The regular test for plugin still applies here. But to test extension on on mechanism driver, the test case should include ML2 mechanism driver with extensions and also resources such as network, port and subnet include extension attribute.

The previous implementation of list_block_devices used blockdev,
which would list partitions, software RAID and other devices as block devices.
By switching to lsblk, the agent can filter down to only physical block
devices, which is all the agent cares about for any of its operations.

This change adds two new fields to the BlockDevice class: model, a string of
the block devices reported model, and rotational, a boolean representing a
spinning disk (True) or a solid state disk (False). This data can be useful
for vendor hardware managers.

[*] Move rebuild instance to conductor task api will help
    in consolidating the logic for both evacuate instance and
    rebuild instance. Rebuild instance and evacuate instance
    uses the conductor task api for rebuild instance workflow.
[*] Add logic required to support rebuild without host.
    (used by evacuate)
[*] Refactor rebuild action to pass the instance host as argument,
    instead of None.

Evacuate and Rebuild will behave the same way as today.
Modifications for the new feature in API will be implemented in
new patches.

Background:
    ML2 plugin sometimes uses truncated port uuids.
    For example, in the case of ofagent and linuxbridge,
    if port id is 804ceaa1-0e3e-11e4-b537-08606e7f74e7,
    an agent would send ""tap804ceaa1-0e"" to the plugin.
    ML2 plugin's _device_to_port_id() would restore it to
    ""804ceaa1-0e"".  While it's still truncated, ML2 plugin's
    get_port() handles that by using ""startswith"".

The recently merged DVR change (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/102332/)
assumes that port_id is always a complete uuid (it's the case
for openvswitch) and fails to handle the above mentioned case.
This commit fixes the regression.

Trying to get the console log from an ERROR-ed server
does not really works

The console log does not contains any meaningful info
related to most status changes,
it is just what the instance prints to the serial console.

Only one action is guest assisted: the 'soft reboot',
which automatically switched to 'hard reboot'
when the guest forgets to assist
(ie. does not shutdown in 120 sec)

Testing the console output presence before reporting
active state would make more sense.

Instead of attempting to get the serial console output,
after this change the response 'fault' field will be used
for exception detail when available.

Problem description =================== One Convergence NVSD controller implements an overlay fabric to provide virtual networks and enable the deployment of network services in the virtual networks. GBP plugin framework provides the capability to use different drivers to render the policy defintion using a specific technology. One Convrgence GBP driver is required to implement the GBP APIs using the connectivity, policy flow and service insertion primitives provided by NVSD controller. Proposed change =============== We propose the addition of a new GBP driver to implement the GBP APIs and render the policy using the NVSD controller. This driver will proxy the APIs via REST interface to the NVSD controller. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None (existing GBP model is used) REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- To use this driver, the configuration files will need to be updated with parameters required to access the NVSD controller. Performance Impact ------------------ This driver should allow for a more scalable solution of GBP deployments using the NVSD controller. Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Hemanth Ravi (hemanthravi) Subrahmanyam Ongole (songole) Work Items ---------- 1. Developing the NVSD GBP driver Dependencies ============ Group Based Policy Plugin Testing ======= Unit tests will be provided. The 3rd party One Convergence CI setup will be enhanced to cover the testing of NVSD GBP driver using the NVSD controller. Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation needs to be updated to reflect the addition of a new GBP driver and it's configuration parameters.

Currently when an operator has to set up quotas, is not able to define
the quotas based on the # of a given flavor, for instance, define the
user quotas as 3 x m1.medium flavor.

Then, if a user boots a new instance and the limit for the flavor
associated to this is exceeded, the system won't create this instance.

This blueprint comes from the operators feedback:
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/operators-feedback-mar14 -> line 448

To address this request I propose to add a new resource for the flavors
that can be use when the operator set up the user quotas.

Related to blueprint per-flavor-quotas.

in system tests for ceph rados gw we
call ostf as soon as deployment finish.
And sometimes test on vilume creation fails
with error status of volume.
Second retry to run test is succesfull.
It was caused by cinder scheduler,
when we run ostf it do not see available spaces for volumes.
So we add single run of volume test with retry and sleep in 60 second
And if it passed - we runs full ostf suits

The Monasca API provides a RESTful JSON interface for interacting with and managing monitoring related resources. The API consists of six main resources: 1. Versions - Provides information about the supported Monitoring API versions. 2. Metrics - The metric resource allows the storage and retrieval of metrics. 3. Measurements - Operations for accessing measurements of metrics. 4. Statistics - Operations for accessing statistics about metrics. 5. Notification Methods - Represents a method, such as email, which can be associated with an alarm via an action. When an alarm is triggered notification methods associated with the alarm are triggered. 5. Alarms - Identifies one or more metrics scoped by name and dimensions, which should trigger a set of actions when the value of a threshold is exceeded. Before using the API, you must first get a valid auth token from Keystone. All API operations require auth token specified in the header of the http request. ## Name and Dimensions A metric is uniquely identified by a name and set of dimensions. ### Name Defines the name of a metric. A name is of type string(64). ### Dimensions A dictionary of (key, value) pairs. The key and value are of type string(255). Dimensions may only use the characters from: a-z A-Z 0-9 . _. ## Alarm Expressions The alarm expression syntax allows the creation of simple or complex alarms to handle a wide variety of needs. Alarm expressions are evaluated every 60 seconds. An alarm expression is a boolean equation which if it evaluates to true with the incoming metrics, will then trigger a notification to be sent. ### Syntax At the highest level, you have an expression, which is made up of one or more subexpressions, joined by boolean logic. Parenthesis can be used for separators. In a BNF style format: ``` expression : subexpression | '(' expression ')' | expression logical_operator expression ``` The logical_operators are: 'and' (also &&), 'or' (also ||). Each subexpression is made up of several parts with a couple of options: ``` subexpression : metric relational_operator threshold_value | function '(' metric ',' period ')' relational_operator threshold_value ('times' periods)? ``` The relational_operators are: 'lt' (also <), 'gt' (also >), 'lte' (also <=), 'gte' (also >=). Threshold values are always in the same units as the metric that they are being compared to. The first subexpression shows a direct comparison of a metric to a threshold_value, done every 60 seconds. #### Example ``` cpu_perc:{hostname=host.domain.com} > 95 ``` #### Example ``` avg(cpu_perc:{hostname=host.domain.com},85) > 90 times 3 ``` Note that period is the number of seconds for the measurement to be done on. They can only be in a multiple of 60. Periods is how many times in a row that this expression must be true before triggering the alarm. Both period and periods are optional and default to 60 and 1 respectively. Functions work on all metric measurements during the period time frame. * min (returns the minimum of all the values) * max (returns the maximum of all the values) * sum (returns the sum of all the values) * count (returns the number of metric observations) * avg (returns the average of all the values) * The metric is a complex identifier that says the name and optional dimensions. ``` metric : name ':' '{' dimensions '}')? ``` #### Simple Example ``` cpu_perc:{hostname=host.domain.com} ``` #### Larger example: ``` (avg(cpu_perc:{hostname=hostname.domain.com}) > 90 ) or ( avg(disk_read_ops:{hostname=hostname.domain.com,device=vda,120) > 1000 t ```","This document describes the Monasca API v2.0, which supports Monitoring as a Service (MONaaS).

Updated ""get_auth"" in ""internal_client.py"" so that it is compatible with
keystoneV2.0 without the dependancy on python-swiftclient. Did this by editing
the code so that it is more similar to the ""get_auth"" fucntion in the
swiftclient library.

Have also updated and added to the unit tests by using many of the ""get_auth""
tests that python-swiftclient incorporates into it's tests.

This commit adds two methods to the vendor interface for the
ipmitool driver:

* send_raw: this is used to send arbitrary bytes to a BMC. One
  example of a use case for this is: many BMCs fail in strange ways
  when 'chassis bootdev disk' is sent without first sending a
  certain sequence of bytes. This is common enough that pyghmi
  even does this by default. Takes one parameter, 'raw_bytes',
  which is the string representation of which bytes should be
  sent. For example: '0x00 0x01'.

* bmc_reset: used to reset a BMC. A cold or warm reset can be
  selected by setting the warm parameter to False (cold) or True
  (warm). Defaults to warm.

This changes splits the internal DB API in two parts, alarm and metering.
It also adds a new configuration options to set a different database
for alarm than the 'metering' one.

Example:

 [database]
 connection = mongodb://localhost/ceilometer
 alarm_connection = mysql://localhost/ceilometer

This changes don't take care of the drivers storaged.
They will be splitted in later changes
The ceilometer.storage.ConnectionProxy object ensure that only alarm methods
are available when the namespace is the alarm one, same for the metering
namespace.

Partial implements blueprint dedicated-alarm-database

Deployment process introduces a lot of disruptive changes
in system configuration which can lead to undesirable state in
nailgun db

As solution - update only timestamp when network data is incorrect

This fix will protect nailgun against wrong network data stored in db
that maybe generated during process of network configuration on slave

The count will ideally be provided when a user makes a request for something like /zones or /records (to limit the need to make multiple queries). Proposed change =============== Currently, the most pressing discussion is over how the JSON for zones and records will be reformatted to accommodate the new totalEntries data. Two possible formats have been proposed. * **Format 1** (presented in the JIRA for `DNS-11 <https://jira.rax.io/browse/DNS-11>`_): .. sourcecode:: http { ""records"" : [ { ""updated"" : ""2011-05-19T13:07:08.000+0000"", ""ttl"" : 5771, ""created"" : ""2011-05-18T19:53:09.000+0000"", ""name"" : ""ftp.example.com"", ""id"" : ""A-6817754"", ""type"" : ""A"", ""data"" : ""192.0.2.8"" }, { ""updated"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:52.000+0000"", ""ttl"" : 86400, ""created"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:52.000+0000"", ""name"" : ""example.com"", ""id"" : ""A-6822994"", ""type"" : ""A"", ""data"" : ""192.0.2.17"" }, { ""updated"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:51.000+0000"", ""ttl"" : 3600, ""created"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:51.000+0000"", ""name"" : ""example.com"", ""id"" : ""NS-6251982"", ""type"" : ""NS"", ""data"" : ""dns1.stabletransit.com"" }, { ""updated"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:51.000+0000"", ""ttl"" : 3600, ""created"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:51.000+0000"", ""name"" : ""example.com"", ""id"" : ""NS-6251983"", ""type"" : ""NS"", ""data"" : ""dns2.stabletransit.com"" }, { ""updated"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:53.000+0000"", ""ttl"" : 3600, ""created"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:53.000+0000"", ""name"" : ""example.com"", ""id"" : ""MX-3151218"", ""priority"" : 5, ""type"" : ""MX"", ""data"" : ""mail.example.com"" }, { ""updated"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:54.000+0000"", ""ttl"" : 5400, ""created"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:54.000+0000"", ""name"" : ""www.example.com"", ""id"" : ""CNAME-9778009"", ""type"" : ""CNAME"", ""comment"" : ""This is a comment on the CNAME record"", ""data"" : ""example.com"" }, ], ""totalEntries"" : 6, ""links"" : { ""self"" : ""..."" } } **Format 2** (proposed by Kiall): .. sourcecode:: http { ""records"" : [ { ""updated"" : ""2011-05-19T13:07:08.000+0000"", ""ttl"" : 5771, ""created"" : ""2011-05-18T19:53:09.000+0000"", ""name"" : ""ftp.example.com"", ""id"" : ""A-6817754"", ""type"" : ""A"", ""data"" : ""192.0.2.8"" }, { ""updated"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:52.000+0000"", ""ttl"" : 86400, ""created"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:52.000+0000"", ""name"" : ""example.com"", ""id"" : ""A-6822994"", ""type"" : ""A"", ""data"" : ""192.0.2.17"" }, { ""updated"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:51.000+0000"", ""ttl"" : 3600, ""created"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:51.000+0000"", ""name"" : ""example.com"", ""id"" : ""NS-6251982"", ""type"" : ""NS"", ""data"" : ""dns1.stabletransit.com"" }, { ""updated"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:51.000+0000"", ""ttl"" : 3600, ""created"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:51.000+0000"", ""name"" : ""example.com"", ""id"" : ""NS-6251983"", ""type"" : ""NS"", ""data"" : ""dns2.stabletransit.com"" }, { ""updated"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:53.000+0000"", ""ttl"" : 3600, ""created"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:53.000+0000"", ""name"" : ""example.com"", ""id"" : ""MX-3151218"", ""priority"" : 5, ""type"" : ""MX"", ""data"" : ""mail.example.com"" }, { ""updated"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:54.000+0000"", ""ttl"" : 5400, ""created"" : ""2011-06-24T01:12:54.000+0000"", ""name"" : ""www.example.com"", ""id"" : ""CNAME-9778009"", ""type"" : ""CNAME"", ""comment"" : ""This is a comment on the CNAME record"", ""data"" : ""example.com"" }, ], ""links"" : { ""self"" : ""..."" }, ""meta"" : { ""totalEntries"" : 6 } } The thought behind Format 2 is that other metadata may need to be included in the future. For instance, when paginating a collection of resources, it may also be useful to know the numerical offset of the page from the first element in the entire collection. Other suggestions for alternative formats are also welcome. API Changes ----------- This change would not add any new endpoints, but it would modify the data presented by some existing endpoints.

Central Changes --------------- A PagedListObjectMixin class will be added that will support the metadata associated with list pagination. This class will be added as a superclass of the ZonesList and RecordsList classes. Storage Changes --------------- Any calls to find_domains will also internally call count_domains and add this count to the DomainsList object that is returned. Any calls to find_records will also internally call count_records and add this count to the RecordsList object that is returned. Other Changes ------------- None Alternatives ------------ None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: jordan-cazamias Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: Juno-1 Work Items ---------- * Agree on spec for API formatting * Implement changes- should not take too long Dependencies ============ https://review.openstack.org/#/c/105021/ ",,216,0

Having the Stack create the Clients object means that custom constraints
do not have access to the already created clients. This greatly
complicates test mocking, and results in unnecessarily created
constraint-scoped clients.

This change makes the Clients be created in RequestContext on demand.
Constraints use the Clients associated with the context.

Mocking client create calls is simplified, generally needing to
call _create once instead of MultipleTimes()

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================ ML2 Mechanism Driver for Cisco Nexus1000v switch ================================================ URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/ml2-n1kv-mechanism-driver The purpose of this blueprint is to add support for Cisco Nexus1000v switch in OpenStack neutron as a ML2 mechanism driver. Problem description =================== Cisco Nexus 1000V for KVM is a distributed virtual switch that works with the Linux Kernel-based virtual machine (KVM) open source hypervisor. * Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM): Controller of the Cisco Nexus1000v DVS based on Cisco NX-OS software. * Virtual Ethernet Module (VEM): Data plane software installed on the Compute nodes. All VEMs are controlled by VSM. * Network Profiles: Container for one or more networks. VLAN type of network profiles will be supported in the initial version. * Policy Profiles: Policy profiles are the primary mechanism by which network policy is defined and applied to VM ports in a Nexus 1000V system. * VM Network: VM Network refers to a combination of network-segment and policy-profile. It maintains a count of ports that use the above combination. This proposed mechanism driver will interact with the VSM via REST APIs to dynamically configure and manage networking for instances created via OpenStack. Proposed change =============== The diagram below provides a high level overview of the interactions between Cisco Nexus1000v switch and OpenStack components. Flows:: +--------------------------+ | Neutron Server | | with ML2 Plugin | | | | +------------+ | | N1Kv | | | Mechanism | +--------------------+ +-------| | Driver | | | | | +-+--+---------+ REST API | Cisco N1KV | | +---+ | N1KV Client +-----------------+ | | | +-----------+--------------+ | Virtual | | | | Supervisor | | | | Module | | | +--------------------------+ | | | | | N1KV VEM +-----------------+ | | | +--------------------------+ +-+------------------+ | | | | | | +---+ Compute 1 | | | | | | | +--------------------------+ | | | | | | +--------------------------+ | | | N1KV VEM +-------------------+ | +--------------------------+ | | | +-------+ Compute 2 | | | +--------------------------+ The Cisco Nexus1000v mechanism driver will handle all the postcommit events for network, subnets and ports. This data will be used to configure the VSM. VSM and VEM will be responsible for port bring up on the compute nodes. The mechanism driver will initialize a default network profile and a policy profile on the VSM. All networks will have a binding to this default network profile. All ports will have a binding to this default policy profile. Dynamic binding of network and policy profiles will be implemented in the future once extensions are supported for mechanism drivers. Alternatives ------------ None. Data model impact ----------------- This mechanism driver introduces three new tables which are specific to the N1KV mechanism driver. * NetworkProfile: Stores network profile name and type. * N1kvNetworkBinding: Stores the binding between network profile and network. * PolicyProfile: Stores policy profile name and UUID. * N1kvPortBinding: Stores the binding between policy profile and port. * VmNetwork: Stores port count for each VM Network. A database migration is included to create the tables for these models. No existing models are changed. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ The performance of Cisco N1kv ML2 mechanism driver will depend on the responsiveness of the VSM. Other deployer impact --------------------- The deployer must provide the following in order to be able to connect to a VSM. * IP address of VSM. * Admin credentials (username and password) to log into VSM. * Add ""cisco_n1kv"" as a ML2 driver. * Add the ""vlan"" type driver. Initially, N1kv mechanism driver supports only the VLAN type driver. These should be provided in: /opt/stack/neutron/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_cisco.ini Example: [ml2_cisco_n1kv] # N1KV Format. # [N1KV:<IP address of VSM>] # username=<credential username> # password=<credential password> Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Abhishek Raut <abhraut> Sourabh Patwardhan <sopatwar> Work Items ---------- Work Items can be roughly divided into the following tasks: * Mechanism driver to handle network/subnet/port CRUD requests. * N1KV Client to perform HTTP requests to the VSM. * Unit test cases to test the mechanism driver and client code. * Tempest test cases to peform functional testing. Dependencies ============ Following third party library used: 1. requests Testing ======= Unit test coverage of the code will be provided. Third party testing will be provided. The Cisco CI will report on all changes affecting this mechanism driver. The testing will run on a setup with an OpenStack deployment connected to a VSM and VEM. Documentation Impact ==================== Configuration details for this mechanism driver. References ========== http://www.cisco.com/go/nexus1000v ",,217,0
