In some cases (for example the testr configuration in [1]) we expect
a PYTHON environment variable to define the python executable to use,
and default to ""python"" if none is present.

By explicitly setting the environment variable in the %python_expand
macro, we are avoiding ambiguity and keeping compatibility with
Python 2 and 3.

This patch is a followup to I6b87b147d301dea3251fe4509b04cd4b9b27ddba,
which lacked the secgroup-rules quota.

The reasoning is the same:
Octavia currently launches load balancer VMs in the services tenant
which has very low quotas by default. This patch increases the values
through the API for the services project to permit lots of load
balancers.

If you deploy a stack with mixed-case hostnames things will break
because no task that is supposed to run on boostrap nodes will run
due to the following code:
HOSTNAME=$(/bin/hostname -s)
SERVICE_NODEID=$(/bin/hiera -c /etc/puppet/hiera.yaml

...

The hiera key might contain mixed-case letters whereas the hostname
won't and the end result is going to be that no bootstrap tasks
will run on any nodes and, amongst other things, no database tables
will be created, making all services unusable.

Since we use bash explicitely we can leverage the ${var,,} expression
for this.

hacking is not capped in g-r and it is in
blacklist for requirement as hacking new version
can break the gate jobs.

Hacking can break gate jobs because of various
reasons:
- There might be new rule addition in hacking
- Some rules becomes default from non-default
- Updates in pycodestyle etc

That was the main reason it was not added in g-r
auto sync also. Most of the project maintained the
compatible and cap the hacking version in
test-requirements.txt and update to new version when
project is ready. Bumping new version might need code
fix also on project side depends on what new in that
version.

If project does not have cap the hacking version then,
there is possibility of gate failure whenever new hacking
version is released by QA team.

Example of such failure in recent release of hacking 1.1.0
- http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2018-May/130282.html

Also includes commit c09634ad80988e960af2bcaca737be3e87ba7592 from
master to ignore W503, otherwise the CI does not pass.

At present this action does not work.  While looking to repair the
functionality I found a number of issues with the current
implementation.

For now I suggest we remove this functionality, and at some point we may
consider replacing it with a `remove-disk` action.

The cidr property for a Neutron subnet should contain
the network cidr, not the network prefixlen.

The example portmap for the fake neutron port in tripleo
depleoyed-server is not correct. We should pass the
netowork cidr in the subnets so that the fake neutron
port subnets attribute return something that match
what an actual neutron port would return.

for local tox test. In Ci infra, target jobs, i.e. without ""-local""
targets, will be ran as setting,

To add these new targets, this patch refreshes requirements
and fixes tests.

Horizon plugins should be tested with Horizon on master branch,
so parent tox, i.e. ""checkbuild"" target on ui-cookiecutter/tox.ini,
will clone horizon from git into .tox/checkbuild/horizon/.

lower-constraints job will be added in subsequent patch.

Publisher service to update Publisher table

When there are no events for a long time, the publisher
service does not update the publisher table. This may
make it look like the publisher is inactive. This will
cause some pub/sub messages to be lost.

This change makes the publisher automatically update
the timestamp in the database every once in a while
(half the timeout time).

rabbitmqctl outputs can be multilined if some

This can happen if container's hostname is too long.

Commit 94ca328e5d309a5617043b2944e65df79271e0cd
introduced filters for ephemeral firewall rules
managed by Ironic Inspectors iptables PXE filter.
These new filters cause duplicate entries in the
persisted firewall rules.

sed expression '/-m comment --comment/p' was used
to ensure the ironic-inspector api port is not
accidentally removed. But the expression also
matches several other entries causing duplicates
to be written.

This change enhances the expression to check for
'-m comment --comment' and 'ironic-inspector'.

better overall performance. This change adds several options which will
ensure container workloads are using the lest amount of storage with the
best possible performance.

All of the ""machines"" mount procedures have been moved into a unified
volume task file. This was done to ensure a consistent experience across
our supported distros. To ensure any new options are non-disruptive, the
mount handler has been changed to use ""reload-or-restart"" which will first
try to reload a mount instead of restarting it mounts.

a)

/os-floating-ips was removed in Compute API 2.36 and from novaclient's
Python API in 10.0

Add to api.computev2:
floating_ip_add()
floating_ip_remove()

Convert add floating IP command to nova-net/neutron split:
""server add floating ip""
""server remove floating ip""

b)

/os-hosts was removed in Compute API 2.43 and from novaclient's
Python API in 10.0.

Add to api.computev2:
host_list()
host_set()
host_show()

Convert host commands to use intenal api:
""host list""
""host set""
""host show""

c)

The introduction of the Network-style commands into the server group
broke cliff's autoprogram directive as it executes the get_parser() methods
without fully initializing the Command object.

NOTE: This is really three reviews squashed to get through the gate in one pass.

In the case of an HA setup (ie with 3 controller nodes) if image
import method is 'glance-direct', it would require a shared
consistent staging location on the controller nodes otherwise it
might happen that the image is uploaded to one node and triggering
the import is executed on a different node - where the image does not
exist.

Hence when import method 'glance-direct' is needed, operators need to
enable it explicitly with enabling NFS across the controller nodes
to share the staging.

To determine the current rabbitmq file descriptor limit, a command has to be

This patch changes the filter to make sure the container image is found.

due to a TLS requirement that the haproxy be on the 'primary' tagged

Update the networks workbook to use the standard message sending
workflow. This workflow reduces the boilerplate that is copied between
workflows by defining the message structure, providing the retry logic
and ensuring the task on a ""FAILED"" message.

The workflow also offers optional persistence in Swift. If the plan name
is given to the workflow it will store the messages in a Swift container
named <plan_name>-messages.

Update the fernet-key-rotate workbook to use the standard message sending
workflow. This workflow reduces the boilerplate that is copied between
workflows by defining the message structure, providing the retry logic
and ensuring the task on a ""FAILED"" message.

The workflow also offers optional persistence in Swift. If the plan name
is given to the workflow it will store the messages in a Swift container
named <plan_name>-messages.

This patch also unsets the pingtest in favor of

...to the proxy-server.

The point is to allow the Swift proxy server to log accurate
client IP addresses when there is a proxy or SSL-terminator between the
client and the Swift proxy server.  Example servers supporting this
PROXY protocol:
  stud (v1 only)
  stunnel
  haproxy
  hitch (v2 only)
  varnish

See http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.7/doc/proxy-protocol.txt

The feature is enabled by adding this to your proxy config file:

  [app:proxy-server]
  use = egg:swift#proxy
  ...
  require_proxy_protocol = true

The protocol specification states:

  The receiver MUST be configured to only receive the protocol
  described in this specification and MUST not try to guess
  whether the protocol header is present or not.

so valid deployments are:

  1) require_proxy_protocol = false  (or missing; default is false)
     and NOT behind a proxy that adds or proxies existing PROXY lines.
  2) require_proxy_protocol = true
     and IS behind a proxy that adds or proxies existing PROXY lines.

Specifically, in the default configuration, one cannot send the swift
proxy PROXY lines (no change from before this patch).  When this
feature is enabled, one _must_ send PROXY lines.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================================== Allow Multiple Sources for TripleO Validations ============================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tripleo/+spec/validation-sources All validations are currently stored in a single directory. This makes it inconvenient to try and write new validations, update from a remote repository or to add an entirely new (perhaps private) source. Problem Description =================== * The deployer wants to develop and test their own validations in a personal checkout without risking changes to the default ones. * The deployer wants to use a stable release of TripleO but consume the latest validations because they are non-disruptive and check for more stuff. * A third party has developed validations specific to their product that they don't want to or can't include in the tripleo-validations repository. Proposed Change =============== Overview -------- We will have a new Mistral environment called ``tripleo-validations``. It will have one key called ``sources`` which will be an array of strings. Each string will be a ``file://`` URI with an absolute path to a directory with validations. On the initial undercloud deployment, this environment will contain: :: { ""sources"": [ ""file:///usr/share/openstack-tripleo-validations/validations/"", ] } If the environment does not exist, all validation actions will behave as if the default environment above was present (to preserve backwards compatibility). The validation Mistral actions (e.g. ``list`` and ``run_validation``) will read that environment and find validations in all the listed sources. If a validation with the same name is in multiple sources, we will always pick the one in the latest source. Which means that if the deployer has a list of ``[default validations, the latest git checkout]``, the validations from the checkout are going to be preferred. In the first iteration, we will only support local directories. In the future, it should be possible to extend this functionality to remote sources as well (by allowing e.g. a ``git://`` URI). .. note:: To make the validation output easier to understand, the validations now provide a custom formatter [1]_. With the proposed setup, each validation directory will use the formatting code it contains. This has the benefit of getting the latest formatting in the default + checkout scenario, but the downside is that different validations could show their results differently. Any bugs in the formatting code would make this matter worse. Do we want to address this as part of this spec? .. note:: In previous discussions about this feature, the idea of storing validations in Swift was always brought up. I believe that is an orthogonal change deserving a separate spec and discussion. If we commit to the proposal here, the API will remain the same if we decide to move validations to Swift later on. Alternatives ------------ * Do nothing. The deployers can already bring in additional validations, it's just less convenient and potentially error-prone. * We could provide a know directory structure conceptually similar to ``run-parts`` where the deployers could add their own validation directories. Security Impact --------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- In order to add their own validations, the deployer will need to update the ``tripleo-validations`` Mistral environment and make sure the new directories are readable by the Mistral processes. We could add a new action and UI functionality to make this easier. Performance Impact ------------------ Running a validation will require traversal of all the available source directories. This could lead to a slow down if the number is large, but that would imply an atypical use that can be fixed by e.g. merging multiple directories into one. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- None Developer Impact ---------------- Testing and developing new validations in both development and production environments will be easier with this change. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: tsedovic Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- * Update instack-undercloud to create the default ``tripleo-validations`` environment. * Update ``load_validations`` and ``find_validation`` functions to read validations from all the sources specified in the environment. * Optional: Mistral action + UI changes for adding new validation sources? Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= The changes will be unit-tested in the tripleo-common and instack-undercloud projects. We could also add a new CI scenario that would have multiple sources set up. Documentation Impact ==================== We will need to document the format of the new Mistral environment and the new behaviour this will introduce. References ========== ..

The fix was to calculate size delta inside extend_volume and pass the
calculated delta to the API resize method.

Time based constraints must prevail over size et al
constraints applied for logs of containerized services.
Time based constraints are needed in order to abide
GDPR requirements.

Depending on FS type, Linux may not allow system operators
to access files creation time attribute (see the Birth
attribute shown as '-' by the stat -c %w command).
This is work-arouned by alternative strict time-based rules
defined in the postrotate script, which purges files in
/var/log/containers and ensures GDPR compliant system
configuration, limited to the containerized services logs.

Extended management of life time of journald and /var/log
files residing on bare metal hosts, should be done in
follow up patches.

For information about the steps an operator needs to perform when running this upgrade please see the user_docs_. The Pike to Queens (P..Q) major upgrade workflow is significantly different to its predecesor (Ocata to Pike) or any previously used upgrade workflow. There are similarities to the Pike_minor_update_ in the general approach of using an initial Heat stack update to generate but not apply configuration, followed by *ansible-playbook $ARGS* to actually deliver it via ansible in a targetted way with respect to the overcloud nodes. The Queens_upgrade_spec_ may also be of interest in describing the design of the P..Q workflow. The P..Q major upgrade workflow is delivered almost exclusively via ansible playbook invocations on the overcloud nodes. Heat is still used however and a Heat stack update is performed against the overcloud stack in the first and last step of the workflow (the 'prepare_' and 'converge_' respectively). The 'prepare' Heat stack update does not apply any TripleO configuration and is exclusively used to generate the ansible playbooks that are subsequently invoked to deliver the upgrade. The 'converge' stack update *does* apply all TripleO configuration against all overcloud nodes and thus serves as a sanity check that the overcloud was successfully upgraded, since the same configuration will already have been applied. The 'converge' will also leave the Heat stack in a good state for subsequent updates, for instance scaling to add nodes. The 'converge' stack update unsets all upgrade specific tripleo-heat-template Heat stack parameters that were set during the upgrade 'prepare'. These parameters are set by the TripleO client (more below) using the prepare_env_file_ and similarly unset using the converge_env_file_. The Queens upgrade workflow brings a new cli via python-tripleoclient_, that allows the operator to invoke the upgrade prepare, run and converge steps, using mistral workflows in tripleo-common_ to invoke either a Heat stack update involving the tripleo-heat-templates_ , or ansible-playbook_ (tripleo-common) depending on the operation.

With dry run, playbooks are not executed.
The env variables, releases script output
and playbooks commands are written out to
files for debug.

The review also moves the collect logs lines
to a function for easier organization.

Documentation for the dry run option and
variable files is added.

During live-migration stress testing we are seeing the following log:
Error from libvirt during undefine. Code=42 Error=Domain not found

There appears to be a race while trying to undefine the domain, and
something else is possibly also doing some kind of clean up. While this
does paper over that race, it stops otherwise completed live-migrations
from failing. It also matches similar error handling done for when
deleting the domain.

The next part of the bug fix is to ensure if we have any similar
unexpected errors during this later phase of the live-migration we don't
leave the instance stuck in the migrating state, it should move to an
ERROR state. This is covered in a follow on patch.

This is an enhancement of the existing file publisher
- 'compress=True"" option is added to provide compression of files
  (within file rotation) to minimize disk usage and minimize bandwidth
  in transferring these files off server
- ‘format=csv’ option is added to the file publisher in order to
   enable CSV format

live_migration_scheme was being used when live_migration_inbound_addr was set.
This prohibits a non-default port/user/extra_params being used, which is often
required to fully describe the uri, particularly for the ssh transport
(see bug#1671288).

However live_migration_inbound_addr also works with live_migration_uri, so for
now revert back to using live_migration_uri in all cases.

This library will be used in TripleO to manage Ironic deployments,
eventually replacing Nova in the undercloud. It was written by me
as a pool of shared code for using Ironic to avoid placing business
logic, useful outside of TripleO, inside TripleO code base.

Is the library actively maintained?
Yes (disclosure: I'm the developer)

Is the library good code?
Yes (passes our standard pep8 check, has 95% unit test coverage
and voting integration testing with devstack)

Is the library python 3 compatible?
Yes (voting unit tests job with python 3.5)

Is the library license compatible?
Yes (Apache 2.0)

Is the library already packaged in the distros we target (Ubuntu latest / Fedora latest)?
No (will work on RDO packaging soon)

Is the function of this library already covered by other libraries in global-requirements.txt?
No (only partial overlap with Nova and Mogan services)

Is the library required for OpenStack project or related dev or infrastructure setup?
Yes (TripleO blueprint nova-less-deploy)

Currently we catch all Exception classes in a few places and log only
the error message. This is very problematic when e.g. KeyError happens,
since its error message is the missing key.

This change:
* Adds exception class to the error message wherever Exception is caught
* Logs traceback when the caught exception does not inherit IronicException
  (we assume that IronicException's come with good error messages and from
  predictable places)
* Fixes meaningless error message when boot.prepare_instance fails.

Neutron runs several processes to support features such as routers,
dhcp, etc. Neutron monitors these processes through shared domain
sockets, pids files, etc in /var/lib/neutron.  When upgrading a node
from a non-containerized deployment to containers, the user and group
ids are updated to that of the container and the supporting processes
are no longer able to access the shared files. This patch adds ACL to
the shared files to resolve this.

Note this only impacts upgraded nodes and only routers, networks, etc,
that existed before the upgrade.

ContainerImagePrepare via the modify_append_tag option, so that the

After purge_after_days, defaults to a 14, forcibly remove
any rotated and compressed logs of containerized services
in /var/log/containers. This overrides any related
containerized logrotate configuration used for
containerized services.

Allow to alter rotation interval for log files managed
via containerized logrotate. Defaults to 'daily'
and rotate 14 (days).

Use sharedscripts to clean up files in the postrotate
script only once.

Additionally, to enforce GDPR compliance of log files
in /var/log/containers, put them under logrotate management
(minsize 1) and always compress. Prohibit the size option
as it does not honor time-based contstraints required by
GDPR. Forcibly remove all files but those rotated and
compressed logs, via the postscript section.

Will read a Heat template with ContainerImagePrepare, prepare containers

The idea is to replace the other commands used by the overcloud for any
use case: undercloud, overcloud or any cloud.

One of the goals here is to execute this process before starting the
containers while deploying OpenStack on any cloud.

Upstream Linux kernel has deleted[*] the `perf` framework integration
with Intel CMT (Cache Monitoring Technology; or ""CQM"" in Linux kernel
parlance), because the feature was broken by design -- an
incompatibility between Linux's `perf` infrastructure and Intel CMT
hardware support.  It was removed in upstream kernel version v4.14; but
bear in mind that downstream Linux distributions with lower kernel
versions than 4.14 have backported the said change.

Nova supports monitoring of the above mentioned Intel CMT events
(namely: 'cmt', 'mbm_local', and 'mbm_total') via the configuration
attribute `[libvirt]/enabled_perf_events`. Given that the underlying
Linux kernel infrastructure for Intel CMT is removed, we should remove
support for it in Nova too.  Otherwise enabling them in Nova, and
updating to a Linux kernel 4.14 (or above) will result in instances
failing to boot.

To that end, deprecate support for the three Intel CMT events in ""Rocky""

If you have nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html To test out your formatting, see http://www.tele3.cz/jbar/rest/rest.html ============ Long Polling ============ https://blueprints.launchpad.net/zaqar/+spec/long-polling Problem description =================== Currently, Zaqar only supports short polling, it means when a client requests messages from a Zaqar queue, Zaqar will return empty response quickly if there is no messages in the queue. So the client will try again. That's not efficient for some cases. Long polling can reduce the number of empty response by allowing Zaqar to wait until a message is available in the queue before sending a response. Proposed change =============== 1. Add new attributes for queue: ``wait_seconds`` ``wait_seconds`` is the duration (in seconds) for which the request waits for a message to send in the queue before returning. If a message is available, the request will return earlier than wait_seconds. If no message is available and the wait time expires, the request returns successfully with an empty list. Value range: 0-20 seconds Default value: 0 2. Add new URL parameter for messages listing API: ``wait_seconds`` Here wait_seconds has the same meaning as the queue attribute mentioned aboved. But any valid value between 1-20 has higher priority over any value set for the queue attribute ``wait_seconds``. Value range: 1-20 seconds Default value: N/A Drawbacks --------- Because long polling needs to keep a long HTTP connection, so it will add workload for Zaqar servers. So HTTP connecton limit may be needed per queue/ tenant. Alternatives ------------ User could use websocket to maintain a long connection which is a popular way in nowadays. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: flwang <flwang@catalyst.net.nz> Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: Queens-3 Work Items ---------- #. Add queue attribute wait_seconds #. Add URL parameter wait_seconds for messages listing REST API. #. Add release note for this feature #. Update API reference #.

TripleO creates that subnet during the Octavia deployment process.
Currently, it is created as a class C subnet with allocation_pools
that essentially limit the number of address in that subnet to 150.

This patch enhances the lb-mgmt-subnet to be class B so the global
amount of Octavia loadbalancers won't be constrained to a very low
number.

TripleO creates that subnet during the Octavia deployment process.
Currently, it is created as a class C subnet with allocation_pools
that essentially limit the number of address in that subnet to 150.

This patch enhances the lb-mgmt-subnet to be class B so the global
amount of Octavia loadbalancers won't be constrained to a very low
number.

Now that bionic testing is added into the tests repos, we can
start testing it in the repo.

Since bionic uses lxc >= 3, we need to make some adjustments to the role
to allow the role to work with both lxc > 3 and lxc < 3, there were
several config options changes which will impact on upgradeability.

LXC >= 3 requires networks to have an index, we can achieve this by

The upgrade/update tasks in tripleo-upgrade started
with a create-scripts book, which generated most of
the scripts from the templates. However, this book
mixed the creation of scripts needed for the overcloud
as well as for the undercloud. This becomes an issue
when we want to perform only an undercloud upgrade, as
we are running tasks intended to the overcloud and it
might not even exist.
This patch divides the script creation tasks used for
the undercloud from the ones used for the overcloud.

The Octavia amphora image RPM failed to install on the undercloud on Red
Hat platforms. Reason was the Ansible playbook, specifically the
octavia-undercloud role, runs as part of octavia_post_deploy workbook as
'mistral' user which is a non-privileged user. Because of this, the
overcloud deployment exits with error when Octavia service is enabled
and tries to install the RPm or updating to latest its version.

This fix is not ideal. Other ways of fixing it have been attempted and
didn't work. For example, moving the image installation and further
image handling logic to an overcloud controller node where we would have
user privileged access to install the RPM. It proved to be less optimal
than current approach because a) controller node would need to be
subscribed to Red Hat OpenStack Platform RPM channels which in many
cases does not happen and b) would require reaching Internet to download
RPM.

This patch instead switches to using Ansible raw module [1] and
whitelist a yum command in sudoers for mistral user. Neither yum, shell
or command modules can be used as they run as Ansible sends Python code
to be executed on the targeted servers. Should we've gone that path,
we'd have needed to whitelist a hugly and insecure regex as follows:

mistral ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python /tmp/ansible-*/yum.py*

So, instead the raw module had to be used as it bypasses Ansible's
module subsystem. Ansible runs the command directly in the target host
and we can predictably allow execution of that particular command with
privileged access.

Add Couchbase 3 support and preliminary work
required for clustering and bucket support.

Elements:

 - Install Couchbase 3.0 and apply recommended OS tweaks.

Server:

 - Report the root state on single instances.
 - Includ recommended (non-SSL) ports in the config.
 - Compute the 'cluster_ramsize' quota based on the
   instance's RAM % (configurable).
   Make the guest retrieve the actual value from the OS (via psutil)
   as the flavor RAM value does not exactly match the
   available amount causing Couchbase to stop provisioning.
 - Encapsulate the 'couchbase-cli' calls.
   Move away from using hardcoded exec strings and build the
   commands dynamically instead.
 - Remove the unnecessary checks for initialization state
   from the status class as we no longer send heartbeats
   during prepare.
 - Removed no-op code (configuration methods).
 - Remove code moved to the elements (performance tweaks).
 - Implement user, datastore and root model for Couchbase.
 - Create status in the App.
 - Make manager name an init arg.
 - Move admin commands to CouchbaseAdmin class
 - Secure single-node 'clusters' (single instance)
   previously using hardcoded password ('password').

This patch set introduces generic user and database API.
The validation and parsing is implemented by derived classes.
The API controller is loaded dynamically based on the
target instance's datastore.

Controller classes on appropriate datastores is defined
in 'user_controller', 'user_access_controller',
'database_controller' configuration property.

Accept cluster ids in the instance API.
By default requests get routed to the first cluster node,
but this behavior may be overriden on per-datastore basis.

Notes:

    - The fake guestagent was updated to follow real guest
      behavior (not rising from get_user).
    - The root controller is now fully generic.
      The check for user existence on the guest is no longer
      required (disabling root multiple times is a noop and
      the root user is no longer removed from the instance)
      Derived root controllers are trivial 'pass' kept for
      backwards-compatibility.
    - Tests from 'mysql/test_common.py' were migrated
      to 'instance/test_instance_controller.py'
      They are concerned about initial users/databases
      (i.e. on instance create).

Implemented custom controllers for MySQL, Cassandra and
Postgresql at this stage.

The block storage service does not have a method for associating trusted certificates with image data stored in a volume. If trusted certificate validation is enabled and an instance is booted from a volume, there is no way for certificate validation to proceed. Therefore, all attempts to boot-from-volume with certificate validation will result in a build error. The seventh change updates the InstancePayload notification base, adding in trusted certificate IDs to every instance notification. This will help users and administrators identify when their instances are leveraging certificate validation and can assist in diagnosing validation failures when they occur. The eighth change updates the control flow for booting instances from volumes, intercepting these requests if certificate validation is enabled and generating a build failure instead. Certificate validation cannot be supported in these cases until the underlying block storage service supports mapping trusted certificate information to instance data [19]. The ninth change adds new policy rules around the use of trusted certificates, allowing nova administrators to easily enable/disable certificate validation if their deployments can/cannot support the feature. Specifically, new policy rules will be added for the server create and build requests. If either request is made and trusted certificates are provided, the policy checker will verify that the operation is allowed. If not, a PolicyNotAuthorized exception will be raised to fail the request. This is useful in cases where a deployment supports boot-from-volume (see the seventh change above) or supports virtualization drivers aside from libvirt. The tenth change updates the novaclient/openstackclient to support theThe eleventh and final change updates the output of the server show command toWith the addition of trusted certificate information to the InstanceExtra data model, all instance notifications should be updated to include the trusted certificate IDs for a specific instance. Specifically, the InstancePayload notification base should be updated to include a 'trusted_certificate_ids' field that will contain the list of trusted certificate IDs obtained from the instance associated with the notification.The inclusion of new policy rules controlling the usage of certificate validation will make it easy for administrators to enable or disable the feature if their deployment supports other features that are incompatible with certificate validation, like boot-from-volume support and non-libvirt based virtualization. * Add a new notification field, 'trusted_certificate_ids', to the InstancePayload notification base. * Modify the control flow for booting an instance from a volume to generate a build error when certificate validation is enabled. * Add new policy rules to allow simple enable/disable control for certificate validation if a deployment supports features that are incompatible with certificate validation.[19] ""Support image signature verification."" https://review.openstack.org/#/c/384143/ - Approved - Amended and re-proposed for official review Version 20 incorporates reviewer feedback, including updates on notification changes for instances, the inclusion of new policy rules, and associated error handling when certificate validation is used with boot-from-volume.",The seventh change updates the novaclient/openstackclient to support theThe eighth and final change updates the output of the server show command toNone,58,3

Manila's post_test_hook runs tempest after
populating tempest.conf with the requisite
options, the results from tempest are saved
prior to performing some post tasks, including
deciding to run tests again with a different
configuration if necessary
(Ex: manila-tempest-minimal-dsvm-dummy). The
result is then replayed at the end of the gate
job so it can be reported to gerrit as a
SUCCESS or a FAILURE.

Fix the mis-aligned command that saves the
test execution status to replay later.

Previously the default role name for the standalone deployment was
'Undercloud'. This was not configurable so unless you used a new role
named 'Undercloud' with 'openstack tripleo deploy', it wouldn't deploy.
This change adds a new command line parameter named --standalone-role to
the command.  The undercloud deploy has been updated to continue to pass
'Undercloud' to this parameter so the containerized undercloud remains
the same.

This patch adds ansible playbooks and roles to carry out migration of
an existing ML2/OVS tripleo setup to ML2/OVN.

In this patch, all the migration tasks are carried out using ansible.
Below are the migration steps

1. Generates a hosts file with the ip addresses of the controllers
and computes.

2. Creates pre migration resources (including a VM) and validates them

3. Runs the overcloud deploy script with ovn-controller's configured to
use a temporary ovs bridge (OVNIntegrationBridge: ""br-migration"")

4. Carry out the migration tasks
   - Generate the OVN north db by running ovn sync util
   - Configure ovn-controllers to take over br-int
   - Delete all the qrouter/q-dhcp namespaces

5. Validates the pre migration resources again to check if everything is fine
or not.

6. Deletes the pre migration resources and creates and validates post migration
resources.

7. Deletes the post migration resources

8. And finally runs the overcloud deploy script again by setting
""OVNIntegrationBridge: ""br-int""

This updates the relevant environment/services templates so that
they also default to docker. Without this change users of these
services could end up with mismatched (unsupported) deployments.

Additionally, this picks environment/services-docker as the
source of truth when resolving collisions for moving those over
environment/services. So environment/services now contain all of
the containerized services' env files used to be located in
environment/services-docker. The latter will be deleted later to

To enable the possibility to migrate a non-routed network to a
routed network allow updating the segment_id of a subnet.

Only allow the operation if:
 - The network only has one segment
 - The network only has one subnet
 - The current segment_id == None

APIImpact: The segment_id attribute of subnets now allows put operation.
