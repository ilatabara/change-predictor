Instances will currently alternate between
BUILD->ACTIVE->BUILD->ACTIVE on create. This was
happening because a race condition existed between
the datastore sending heartbeats that the service is
ACTIVE before and the prepare call manually stopping
the service to bring the status back to BUILD.

The fix is to add an optional param force to set_status
that is going to be set to True for end_install_or_restart
which is called at the end of prepare for all datastores either
directly or through app.complete_install_or_restart(). When
set_status is called it will now check if the instance status
was currently BUILDING and if the force flag is False. This
means that the prepare call has not yet finished and to skip
the heartbeat from updating the status. Once prepare is finished
it will call complete_install_or_restart which will in turn
call end_install_or_restart and force the status to be updated
from BUILD to ACTIVE. If setting status to FAILED or
BUILD_PENDING it will never skip the heartbeat.

For mongodb I added complete_install_or_restart to service.py
to be called at the end of prepare for single instance mongo
instead of calling set_status directly to RUNNING.

Cleaned up BaseDbStatusTests and added new tests covering new
logic.

The SQL command ForeignKey marks a requirement that two tables are kept
in sync with a common key.  We want to ensure that for every project
quota record, there is a matching project record in the projects
table.

Also add the migration script that adds the project quotas table
to databases based on an older Barbican database model.

Following are some guidelines for reference to ensure consistency, reduce confusion, and enable documentation clarity. Project Naming Process ---------------------- The Technical Committee reviews the incoming project proposals through the openstack/governance repository with an update to the doc/source/reference/ projects.yaml file. TC members should review the patches with these guidelines. Project Name Guidelines ----------------------- When seeking a team name refer to the `Legal Issues FAQ <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/LegalIssuesFAQ>`_ on the OpenStack wiki. Realize the team name will not be a trademark. In documentation on `docs.openstack.org <http://docs.openstack.org>`_, team names are lowercase, such as nova and keystone and when referring to the Command Line Interfaces (CLI) for those projects. Service Name Guidelines ----------------------- When naming the service that your project provides, please consider the use of the service name in documentation for operators, administrators, end-users, and developers consuming the service. The current convention is: Do not use OpenStack in the name of the service. Use module if it is consuming other services (such as heat). Use service in general as that is mostly what is being added as projects. Uppercase first letter of first word only. Review Guidelines ----------------- If you have a question about legal use of the OpenStack name or logo, refer to the `OpenStack Brand website <http://www.openstack.org/brand>`_. Refer to `Documentation Conventions <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation/Conventions#Service_and_project_names>`_ and ask for guidance on the openstack-docs mailing list if you have questions about using the names in context. Refer to the IBM Style Guide for final arbitration about a term. ",,47,0

As the 'current' alembic command seems to not be working with
multiple heads, this patch maps the 'neutron-db-manage current'
command to 'alembic heads',  which correctly reports the current
head for each branch.

This patch redefines the mapping of the 'current' action rather
than defining a new action in order to ensure seamless experience
for neutron-db-manage users.

This is a request to add the App Catalog to the OpenStack
namespace.  The Community App Catalog is a collection of
ready-to-use applications, Heat templates and machine images, and
other OpenStack components that you can immediately deploy into
your OpenStack cloud.

The project was  developed in coordination with the OpenStack
Foundation, and is hosted by OpenStack Infra at
http://apps.openstack.org.  This project is already using all of
the OpenStack infrastructure and services and is gated through
gerrit.

We are using the both the Dev and Operators mailing list, and
bring up initiatives on the mailing lists in order to provide
ample opportunity for those in the community to provide feedback,
and so everyone can be kept aware of our progress and intentions.
We also hold weekly IRC meetings[1] which are announced
regularly, and logged for review.

The IRC channel #openstack-app-catalog is logged[2], and active
with community members, core developers and like minded people
all helping and discussing issues within the project as well as
questions that come up from using the App Catalog or adding
content to it.

Christopher Aedo has been acting as the temporary PTL, and has
been actively working with the App Catalog since before it was
officially launched at the Vancouver summit. We plan to hold an
official PTL election before the Tokyo summit.

This commit is a formal request to add the Community App Catalog
into the OpenStack namespace as an official project.

This commit adds basic docs building support to grenade. Previously
we just had rst files in the root of the repo and relied on github
or something else to render them. After this commit we'll support
sphinx built docs.

The next step after this is to add a docs publishing job to infra so

The Hyper-V driver uses the Microsoft\Windows\SMB WMI namespace
in order to handle SMB shares. The issue is that this namespace is
not available on Windows versions prior to Windows Server 2012.

For this reason, the Hyper-V driver fails to initialize on Windows
Server 2008 R2.

This patch fixes the issue by properly handling the PathUtils
initialization.

Nova Hyper-V driver fails to detach virtual hard disks when using
the virtualizaton v1 WMI namespace. This affects Windows Server
2008 as well as Windows Server 2012 when the old namespace is used.

The reason is that it cannot find the attached resource,
using the wrong resource object connection attribute.

This patch fixes the issue by using the right resource connection
attribute when attempting to find an attached virtual disk resource
by its path.

The base object obj_reset_changes method has a recursive parameter that
dives into objects within an object to reset changes.  The Flavor and
Instance objects override that method but are missing that parameter.
The recursive parameter was not added to those objects when it was
changed on the base object.

The resulting action can be only pass or fail. Validators are configured in the ``config.json`` file and each one comes with different options. Included validators ------------------- The following validators are implemented at the moment: ``common_name`` Verifies: CSR. Parameters: ``allowed_domains``, ``allowed_networks``. Ensures that the CN matches one of names in ``allowed_domains`` or IP ranges in ``allowed_networks``. ``alternative_names`` Verifies: CSR. Parameters: ``allowed_domains``. Ensures that names specified in the subject alternative names extension match one of the names in ``allowed_domains``. ``alternative_names_ip`` Verifies: CSR. Parameters: ``allowed_domains``, ``allowed_networks``. Ensures that names specified in the subject alternative names extension match one of the names in ``allowed_domains`` or IP ranges in ``allowed_networks``. ``blacklist_names`` Verifies: CSR. Parameters: ``allowed_domains``, ``allowed_networks``. Ensures that the CN and subject alternative names do not contain anything configured in the ``domains``. ``server_group`` Verifies: Auth, CSR. Parameters: ``group_prefixes``. Ensures the requester is authorised to get a certificate for a given server. This is currently assuming specific server naming scheme which looks like ``{prefix}-{name}.{domain}``. For example if the prefixes are defined as ``{""Nova"": ""nv""}``, and the client authentication returns group ""Nova"", then a request for ``nv-compute1.domain`` will succeed, but a request for ``gl-api1.domain`` will fail. Only CN is checked and if there are no dashes in the CN, validation succeeds. This is not a well designed validator and may not be safe to use! A better version is on the TODO list. ``extensions`` Verifies: CSR. Parameters: ``allowed_extensions``. Ensures that only ``allowed_extensions`` are present in the request. The names recognised by Anchor are: policyConstraints, basicConstraints, subjectDirectoryAttributes, deltaCRLIndicator, cRLDistributionPoints, issuingDistributionPoint, nameConstraints, certificatePolicies, policyMappings, privateKeyUsagePeriod, keyUsage, authorityKeyIdentifier, subjectKeyIdentifier, certificateIssuer, subjectAltName, issuerAltName ``key_usage`` Verifies: CSR. Parameters: ``allowed_usage``. Ensures only ``allowed_usage`` is requested for the certificate. The names recognised by Anchor are: Digital Signature, Non Repudiation, Key Encipherment, Data Encipherment, Key Agreement, Certificate Sign, CRL Sign, Encipher Only, Decipher Only, as well as short versions: digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment, keyAgreement, keyCertSign, cRLSign, encipherOnly, decipherOnly ``ca_status`` Verifies: CSR. Parameters: ``ca_requested``. Ensures the request does/doesn't require the CA flag. This is not a well designed validator and may not be safe to use! A better version is on the TODO list. ``source_cidrs`` Verifies: CSR. Parameters: ``cidrs``. Ensures the request comes from one of the ranges in `cidrs`. Extension interface ------------------- Custom validators can be used with Anchor without changing the application itself. All validators are exposed as Stevedore_ extensions. They're registered as entry points in namespace ``anchor.validators`` and each name points to a simple function which accepts the following keyword arguments: ``csr`` : anchor.X509.signing_request.X509Csr An object describing the submitted CSR. ``auth_result`` : anchor.auth.results.AuthDetails An object which contains authentication information like username and user groups. ``request`` : pecan.Request The https request which delivered the CSR. ``conf`` : dict Dictionary describing the registration authority configuration. On successful return, the request is passed on to the next validator or signed if there are no remining ones. On validation failure an ``anchor.validators.ValidationError`` exception must be raised. .. _Stevedore: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/stevedore/index.html",TODO,116,1

While it provides one implementation (based on cryptography.io and OpenSSL), other implementations may be configured. The backend is configured by setting ca.backend configuration value to the name of the right module. Backend implementations need to provide only one function: sign(csr, conf), taking the parsed CSR and the ""ca"" block of the configuration as parameters and returning signed certificate in PEM format. If `ca.backend` is not defined, it defaults to string `anchor.certificate_ops` The resulting certificate is stored locally if the `output_path` is set to any string. This does not depend on the configured backend. Backends can specify their own options - please refer to the backend documentation for the specific list. The default backend takes the following options: * `cert_path`: path where local CA certificate can be found * `key_path`: path to the key for that certificate * `signing_hash`: which hash method to use when producing signatures * `valid_hours`: number of hours the signed certificates are valid for Sample configuration for the default backend: ""ca"": { ""cert_path"": ""CA/root-ca.crt"", ""key_path"": ""CA/root-ca-unwrapped.key"", ""output_path"": ""certs"", ""signing_hash"": ""sha256"", ""valid_hours"": 24 } ",,85,16

now. Virtual registration authority is a new concept which right now includes
everything the original configuration included. That means for example each
registration authority available within Anchor deployment can configure its own
CA, auth, and validators. Clients request a specific registration authority via
the URL. This does not mean they can just choose who signs the CSR - they still
need to pass all checks. Only the guesswork of ""which validation set applies to
them"" is gone because of this change.

The previous concept of validator sets is gone. Each registration authority
configures its own validators and all of them need to pass.

Previous endpoint /sign will not work anymore. It's incompatible with
the new design.

The configuration file changes in the following way:
1. Registration authorities need to be defined in the main config.
2. Validator sets are not available anymore.
3. CA and auth settings at the top level need to be named. They can be referred
   to in the registration authority block.
4. Old names are removed. Any use of ""auth"", ""ca"", or ""validators"" at the top
   level will result in an error and explanation regarding the upgrade path.

Further documentation and a sample config with the new layout can be found in
the docs/configuration.rst file.

When running Keystone in WSGI, Glance_image is not run in the right
moment.
This patch aims to make sure Glance_image is run after creating Glance
endpoint Keystone resource by using the Puppet chain arrow.
Keystone_endpoint is actually the latest resource created by Keystone
providers to make Glance working.
If Glance_image resource is in the catalog, it will be executed when
keystone & glance are actually ready and not before.

If an event comes in that does not have a associated router_id, we attempt
to call out to neutron to resolve it by tenant_id and cache it locally on
the TenantRouterManager instance. This happens during get_state_machines()
and, if a router could not be found, the event msg effectively gets dropped.

This is a bit of a waste of Neutron calls if the event happens to be one
that would be ignored later on by the worker (for global or tenant debug,
for example)

This moves that caching out to the worker using a dumb in-memory dict based
cache (we could back this by memcache and improve it if it ends up being
beneficial)  Instead of having the TRM decide to drop messages with no
associated router, we move that responsibility up to the worker where its
already doing similar things around debug modes.  Ensuring the worker has
visibility of the router_id at all times will later let it use this as a
hash key when RUGs are managed using a distributed hash ring.

The Monasca API states that dimensions may not begin with an underscore;
as such no dimensions should be returned that begin with an underscore,
even if they are in the database.

This issie was exposed by new behaviour in InfluxDB 0.9.0 which resulted
in a _key column always being included in returned output. This feature
is scheduled to be removed in 0.9.3, (see
https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/3076) but monasca-api should still
be robust against this behaviour.

This patch ensures secrets files processed by pw-token-gen retain:
* Licence header
* Commented out keys

The implementaiton stores all single hashed lines and inserts them into
the output file before the yaml dump.

Double hashed lines are not retained as they are section headers and
wouldn't make sense in the output.

This has some benefits and some drawbacks. This spec is aimed at addressing the drawbacks. Launchpad Blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/trove/+spec/backup-encryption-keys Problem Description =================== Currently the Trove backup and restore feature encrypt a backup using openssl and a static key (backup_aes_cbc_key) if backup_use_openssl_encrypt is set to true. This is (by default) enabled and operators, I am told, would prefer to have backups encrypted rather than in plain text to minimize their liabilities arising from loss of data. The encryption erects at least a small barrier of protection. Yet, a static key has some issues. First, it is a system-wide, static key. If changed, it would invalidate all existing backups. But for the reason stated above, encryption is favored. Proposed Change =============== The proposal is that Trove (no longer) use the static system-wide key for backup encryption. Rather, when a user attempts to launch a backup, it should accept a pass-phrase from the user and use that as, or in the generation of a backup key. When the user wishes to launch a new instance based on a backup, the user will be required to provide the key. The above would address part of the problem in the future. It still leaves at least two issues to be addressed. First, operators prefer a backup be encrypted rather than be stored in plain text. For this, it is proposed that we continue to use the existing system-wide static key mechanism. Second, when changing keys, care must be taken to ensure that old backups can still be read. By retaining the legacy key mechanism as the fall-back if no key is provided, we ensure that old backups can still be read. Configuration ------------- The proposal is that a new configuration parameter be added. backup_require_encryption_key [True| False] default: False If set to True, backup will require the user to provide an encryption key. If set to False, the system performance will default to the present operation(s). Database -------- There is no proposed schema change. Public API ---------- The backup-create and create API calls require a new parameter: backup_encryption_key. Public API Security ------------------- The proposed API changes introduce a scheme that will send an encryption key as part of a ReST'ful call. Sending this key in plain text over the network is not prudent. However, since the key needs to be used on the receiving side, a one-way cipher cannot be used. Options to protect the key in flight would be a reversible cipher, a pki scheme, or to rely on the encryption of the underlying transport. In the absence of a multi-step exchange between the client and the API service which would lend itself to a secure exchange of a password, we propose the use of a simple reversible cipher, and to rely on the security of the underlying transport. Python API ---------- Nothing is removed. CLI (python-troveclient) ------------------------ Yes, the Trove client will now accept the new pass phrase on the backup-create and the create calls. Internal API ------------ Yes, the key needs to make its way over to the guest agent. Guest Agent ----------- Yes, and the proposed behavior is backwards compatible. Alternatives ------------ One alternative that was considered was to introduce a more secure way of getting the key from the client to the API service. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: amrith Milestones ---------- Liberty-1 Work Items ---------- TBD Upgrade Implications ==================== Existing backups will be preserved as the legacy behavior is preserved. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= TBD Documentation Impact ==================== The user documentation and the API documentation will need to be changed.

There were several examples showing passing an

log the exception details, so doing something
like this results in the exception information

This updates the devtest scripts so they support using
--visibility instead of --is-public.

Add --container-format to places where glance is called
as its now required.

Use ""nova image-show"" in place of glance, as glance now
only take an image id and no longer accepts the image name.

Ubuntu packaging for Liberty - called Liberty Staging - is broken for
one month for heat, ironic and python-glanceclient.
It currently blocks our CI to land patches.

To unblock the situation, this patch aims to make the 3 jobs non-voting
but still running so we can monitor them and revert this patch when
packages are stable enough.

Jobs that we want non-voting:
* gate-puppet-glance-puppet-beaker-rspec-dsvm-trusty
* gate-puppet-heat-puppet-beaker-rspec-dsvm-trusty
* gate-puppet-ironic-puppet-beaker-rspec-dsvm-trusty

There are cases where it takes a long time to create a new resource as
requested by the scaling operation on an ASG resource, for instance, a
nova server creation followed by a complex SoftwareDeployment. During
this process, additional alarms may come in but failed to be blocked
by the current cooldown checking mechanism because the very first
timestamp has yet to be generated. This is leading to unexpected size
adjustment to the ASG.

This patch augments the existing cooldown checking mechanism with a
scaling-in-progress test so that additional alarms arriving during
the very first scaling operation will be ignored.

A standard meter definition looks like the following:: --- metric: - name: 'meter name' event_type: 'event name' type: 'type of meter eg: gauge, cumulative or delta' unit: 'name of unit eg: MB' volume: 'path to a measurable value eg: $.payload.size' resource_id: 'path to resouce id eg: $.payload.id' project_id: 'path to project id eg: $.payload.owner' The definition above shows a simple meter definition with some fields. The ``name``, ``event_type``, ``type``, ``unit`` and ``volume`` are require fields. A generic notification handler consumes the notification message and matches with the meters defined in the `meter.yaml` file. If there is a match on the event type, samples are generated for the meter. The values that need to be searched in the notification message are set with a jsonpath starting with ``$.``. For example, if we need to lookup the volume information from the message, its set as a jsonpath `$.payload.size'. There are cases where multiple meters need to be defined in a single meter definition. The following is the meter definition example showing how to define multi meters:: --- metric: - name: $.payload.measurements.[*].metric.[*].name event_type: 'event_name.*' type: 'delta' unit: $.payload.measurements.[*].metric.[*].unit volume: payload.measurements.[*].result resource_id: $.payload.target user_id: $.payload.initiator.id project_id: $.payload.initiator.project_id In the above example, the ``name`` field is a json path with matching a list of meter names defined in the notification message. More complex operations can be handled with json paths. For example in the following example, ``volume`` and ``resource_id`` fields perform an arithmetic and string concatenation:: --- metric: - name: 'compute.node.cpu.idle.percent' event_type: 'compute.metrics.update' type: 'gauge' unit: 'percent' volume: payload.metrics[?(@.name='cpu.idle.percent')].value * 100 resource_id: $.payload.host + ""_"" + $.payload.nodename There are some existence meters defined in the `meter.yaml`. These meters have a ``volume`` as 1 and are at the bottom of the yaml file with a note suggesting that these will be deprecated in M release. For example, the meter definition for existence meters is as follows:: --- metric: - name: 'meter name' type: 'delta' unit: 'volume' volume: 1 event_type: - 'event type' resource_id: $.payload.volume_id user_id: $.payload.user_id project_id: $.payload.tenant_id By default, these meters will not be loaded. To load these meters, flip the `disable_non_metric_meters` configuration option. ",,82,0

default_ipv4_subnet_pool and default_ipv6_subnet_pool in neutron.conf
are currently defined by uuid. This doesn't actually work as the admin
cannot know the uuid of the subnetpool until after neutron has been
started and the subnetpool has been created.

This patch changes the above values to be set by name, allowing the admin
to create the relevant subnetpools after starting the neutron service.

If multiple subnetpools exist with the same name, a new error
""MultipleSubnetPoolsFound"" will be returned.

Tracing through Nova ==================== When one first starts to look at the Nova code, it can be hard to see how the parts communicate. This document presents a vertical trace through a live migration request, to demonstrate the code path and thereby aid new developers in traversing and comprehending the Nova codebase. External API ------------ To map URLs to controllers and actions, OpenStack uses the `Routes`_ package. URLs are mapped to ""action"" methods on ""controller"" classes in ``nova/api/openstack/__init__/ApiRouter.__init__``. Most developers will be more interested in the action methods themselves. These are held in: * ``nova/api/openstack/compute/servers.py`` * ``nova/api/openstack/compute/contrib/\*.py`` * ``nova/api/openstack/compute/plugins/v3/\*.py`` (soon to be removed) We will find ``@wsgi.action('os-migrateLive')`` annotating ``_migrate_live`` in ``contrib/admin_actions.py``. After parsing some arguments, this calls ``self.compute_api.live_migrate``. Checking the ``__init__`` method of ``self`` (the ``AdminActionsController``), we can see that ``self.compute_api`` is just an alias to ``nova.compute.API``. We can see ``nova/compute.py`` doesn't exist but there is a module called ``nova/compute``. So we look at ``nova/compute/__init__.py`` and happily an API class is declared. This uses a utility method to import all the methods from either ``nova.compute.api.API`` (in the normal case) or ``nova.compute.cells_api.ComputeCellsAPI`` (if this node is configured as a Cells API node). Let's ignore Cells for now and look for the ``live_migrate`` method we wanted on ``nova.compute.api.API``. This is easily found in ``nova/compute/api.py`` (we'll gloss over the class/filename mapping from now on). It calls ``self.compute_task_api.live_migrate_instance``. ``self.compute_task_api`` is a property method of the ``API`` class, which simply lazy-loads ``nova.conductor.ComputeTaskAPI``. Checking ``nova/conductor/__init__.py`` we can quickly see ``nova.conductor.ComputeTaskAPI`` proxies calls to either ``nova.conductor.api.LocalComputeTaskAPI`` or ``nova.conductor.api.ComputeTaskAPI`` depending on whether configuration parameter ``[conductor] use_local`` is set. Let's look at the RPC case first. Remembering we called ``live_migrate_instance`` back in ``nova/compute/api.py``, we find that method on the ``ComputeTaskAPI`` class. It doesn't do very much before calling ``self.conductor_compute_rpcapi.migrate_server``. ``self.conductor_compute_rpcapi`` is always an alias to ``nova.conductor.rpcapi.ComputeTaskAPI`` so let's look for a ``migrate_server`` method on there. This method does some version negotiation. It's important to remember that the conductor may have been upgraded to a later version than the compute nodes, so requests which go through the conductor may have to be back-versioned. The request then disappears into: ``cctxt.call(context, 'migrate_server', **kw)``. This is where some ``nova/rpc.py`` and ``oslo.messaging`` magic happens. So far, all this has been executing on the API server which received the HTTP request. At this point, the API server sends a message to RabbitMQ and unwinds its call stack. Soon afterwards, a Conductor node will pick up this message and continue execution. Conductor --------- RPC calls go to Manager classes. In this case, the call turns up on the ``nova.conductor.manager.ComputeTaskManager`` so let's look there for ``migrate_server``. Incidentally, this pattern of local API, RPC API and Manager is pretty common in Nova. Managers are where much of the juicy code lives. ``migrate_server`` is a bit of a clearing-house. Based on our parameters of ``live=True``, ``rebuild=False`` and ``flavor=None``, we call ``self._live_migrate``. This internal helper calls another helper, ``self._build_live_migrate_task`` to generate a ``nova.conductor.tasks.live_migrate.LiveMigrationTask`` and immediately executes it. The task checks the destination before passing off the request to ``self.compute_rpcapi.live_migration``. ``self.compute_rpcapi`` is assigned from the ``compute_rpcapi`` parameter to the task's ``__init__`` method. Remembering the task was constructed by the ``nova.conductor.manager.ComputeTaskManager``, we can trace through to that classes ``__init__`` where ``self.compute_rpcapi`` is set to ``nova.compute.rpcapi.ComputeAPI``. Thankfully we do find the ``live_migration`` method we're looking for on that class. Again, this disappears into RPC, to emerge on the compute node. Compute ------- This is it, the final step. We have traversed the API and Conductor code to reach the ``nova.compute.ComputeManager`` of the Compute node we want to migrate our instance from at last. This is where the rubber hits the road. After a little bit of fuss, we call ``self.driver.live_migration``. ``self.driver`` is loaded in ``__init__`` by ``nova.virt.driver.load_compute_driver``, which loads the class specified by configuration parameter ``compute_driver``. Let's suppose we're running libvirt and consequently this parameter is set to ``libvirt.LibvirtDriver``. ``nova.virt`` is prepended meaning we load ``nova.virt.libvirt.LibvirtDriver``. ``nova/virt/libvirt/__init__.py`` aliases this to ``nova.virt.libvirt.driver.LibvirtDriver``. Remembering we were trying to call ``self.driver.live_migration``, we can now find this method on the ``LibvirtDriver``. This also brings us to the end of our journey. Conclusion ---------- This article demonstrated how to trace a live migration request all the way from Nova's HTTP interface on the API node, through the Conductor, all the way down to the libvirt driver. It showed how a little persistence and basic knowledge of Python class and module name resolution allows you to tunnel almost all the way through Nova, with only a couple of walls presented by RPC interactions. I hope you found it helpful! **[TODO: add github links to all code references]** .. _Routes: http://routes.groovie.org/ ",,78,0

oslo_utils.timeutils.isotime() is deprecated as of 1.6 so we need
to stop using it.

This patch replaces timeutils.isotime(dt) with dt.isoformat() as
the deprecation message suggests in oslo_utils.timeutils.
However this might be a backward incompatible change as
timeutils.isotime() produced '1955-11-05T18:00:00Z' format
but datetime.isoformat() produces '1955-11-05T18:00:00+00:00'
format.

The following places still use the deprecated method because
oslo.versionedobject also use it:

* nova.tests.unit.objects.test_objects
* nova.tests.unit.objects.test_fields
* nova.tests.unit.objects.test_instance

The above places will be fixed after oslo.versionedobject are fixed
with Ied2643d3d891600e0e5cd31c7ef1ff6107e3a777

Before this patch, if user's rights were changed
or revoked - there would be ""Unauthorized"" errors
on every page since user had no rights to view them
because he had no valid tokens in that case.

Now user will be logged out if he has no valid tokens.
Set `escalate` to True (for unauthorized-error)
to always log user out.

Also, now horizon.exceptions.NotAuthorized is a part of
UNAUTHORIZED tuple in the exceptions.py, because this type
of exception is re-raised after handling services unauthorized errors.
Looks like it was missing. Now the horizon.exceptions.NotAuthorized
is handled like all NotAuthorized exceptions.

And horizon_middleware.py in process_exception now generates
logout_reason for cases if user is not authorized.

The connect method of ssync_sender tells the remote connection that it's
going to send a valid HTTP chunked request, but if the remote end needs
to respond with an error of any kind sender throws HTTP right out the
window, picks up his ball, and closes the socket down hard - much to the
surprise of the eventlet.wsgi server who up to this point had been
playing along quite nicely with this 'SSYNC' nonsense assuming that
everyone here is consenting mature adults.

If you're going to make a ""Transfer-Encoding: chunked"" request have the
good decency to finish the job with a proper '0\r\n\r\n'. [1]

N.B. It might be possible to handle an error status during the
initialize_request phase with some sort of 100-continue support, but
honestly it's not entirely clear to me when the server isn't going to
close the connection if the client is still expected to send the body
[2] - further if the error comes later during missing_check or updates
we'll for sure want to send the chunk transfer termination line before
we close down the socket and this way we cover both.

ofport is usually an integer but when a port is not ready
ofport is an empty set.
This patch makes SimpleInterfaceMonitor handle that case too.

Creating a port on a prefix delegation enabled subnet with a fixed ip
list containing only the subnet id will cause a DBDuplicateEntry error.
This is because the subnet is not treated as an ipv6 auto address subnet
as it should be by _test_fixed_ips_for_port in ipam_non_pluggable_backend.py

All IPV6 PD subnets are auto address subnets, so the additional check was
unnecessary and incorrect in this case.

This patch changes the condition for appending the subnet id to the
fixed_ip_set so that PD subnets are treated the same as auto address
subnets. Also includes a unit test to catch this failure.

When SR-IOV introduce in Juno Agent supported only link state change
Some Intel cards don't support setting link state, so to
resolve it the SR-IOV mech driver supports agent and agent less mode.
From Liberty the SR-IOV agent brings more functionality like
qos and port security so we want to make the agent mandatory.
(of course I already talked with Intel Guys to get their approval)

This patch deprecates the agent_required in Liberty
and updates the agent_required default to be True.

This reverts commit 3b2d14ad993c1e605f0242f99eb2224bbc10c353.

This has been causing heat to break for a number of users running
mariadb 10 - this may be a dependency issue, but reverting this
until we work out why things are broken seems the safest course
of action.

Tripleo is in the process of changing from tripleo-incubator/devtest
driven CI to CI driven by instack.

Until we are confident that the instack based CI is reliable and
gives us the coverage we want. We are removing our CI from all non tripleo
projects, with the exceptions of heat, ironic, neutron and nova as we have
found a lot of value in running running our CI on these projects in the past.
For these 4 projects the instack jobs will be available in the
experimental-tripleo queue.

Remove the ubuntu based jobs as instack doesn't currently support them
and there isn't currently any users interested in adding support.

The SolidFire driver uses a simple method of gathering
the Storage Virtual IP, it just queries the Cluster and
asks for the SVIP. This is great almost all the time,
BUT it doesn't take into consideration that the deployer
may be using VLAN's and accessing the cluster from multiple
clouds, or multiple networks.

This patch just adds a config option to specify an SVIP
if the admin has configured VLANs in their environment and
on their cluster.  The default behavior is to still use the
global SVIP.

Adds support for root-enable for Vertica clusters,
with optional user-provided passwords. In order to
support root-enable for clusters, a new route was added.

A new VerticaRootController extends the features that
the RootController provides for clusters. This datastore
specific controller is added to the subfolder vertica
in extensions.

When testing upgrades, we have some cases where we apply the wsgi
manifest first and then eventlet. The problem is apache which is started
so keystone cannot be started because ports are already in use.

So this patch installs Apache on eventlet manifest and makes sure the
service is stopped before trying to start keystone with eventlet.

Library release requests are filed as patches to deliverables files in the openstack/releases repository, see the README there for more details. Before beginning this process, you need to set up ``gpg`` with a valid key, and authorize launchpad to run the release tools commands. Authorizing launchpad can be tricky on a system that only provides a terminal-based browser, since the launchpad site does not work well with the default configuration of ``lynx`` (cookies and referrer headers need to be enabled for the launchpad site). Newer versions of launchpadlib also rely on keyring, which may require a password for every command being run if you are not in a graphical environment with a better interactive key manager. Talk with dhellmann if you start a release and run into trouble with launchpad auth. When a release request is ready to be approved, follow these steps: 1. If the release includes any completed blueprints, go to launchpad and create a ``next-$SERIES`` milestone as part of the ``$SERIES`` release. Set the targets for the blueprints to ``next-$SERIES`` and mark them as implemented. If there are no blueprints, this step can be skipped. 2. If this is a stable release and there are bugs to be reported as fixed, create a ``next-$SERIES`` milestone as part of the ``$SERIES`` release and target the bugs to the milestone. Set their status to ``Fix Committed``. If the release is from the ``master`` branch, this step can be skipped. 3. The release team member taking responsibility for the release should approve the change in ``openstack/releases``. Release requests should not be approved until we are actually ready to cut the release. 4. After the release request merges, check out or update a local copy of ``openstack/releases`` to get the new version of the deliverable file. 5. In a local copy of this ``openstack-infra/release-tools`` repository, run ``release_from_yaml.py``, giving the path to the deliverable file and the version from that file that needs to be released as arguments. For example:: $ ./release_from_yaml.py ~/repos/openstack/releases/deliverables/liberty/openstack-doc-tools.yaml 0.30.1 6. As the release script runs, it reports on the existing tags in the branch being released and offers a last chance to review the new tag in light of the history. Press ``<return>`` when ready to continue, then enter the pass phrase for your GPG key to add the tag. 7. After the tag is created locally and pushed up to the remote server, the script generates a release announcement email with some basic change information. It prints the results to the console, and saves a copy in ``relnotes/$project-$version``. The file is a fully formatted email, ready to be processed with a tool like ``msmtp``. If you use another mailer, copy the contents of the subject and body into the mail program, preserving the topic tags in the subject line, then send the message to ``openstack-announce@lists.openstack.org`` with the ``Reply-To`` header set to ``openstack-dev@lists.openstack.org``. 8. After the release notes are written out, the script ensures that a launchpad milestone with the version number is created. If there is a ``next-$SERIES`` milestone, it is renamed and used. For releases from ``master``, all closed bugs are targeted to the new milestone. For stable branches, bugs should be targeted explicitly (see step 2).",,80,0

Several problems exist with Horizon on centos+binary:

1. The default setup of http binds a port to port 80 on RPM
   based distros.

2. There is no horizon user/group added causing config-external
   to break badly.

3. openstack-dashboard is installed in
   /usr/share/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard. This
   is incompatible with the expectations of the wsgi configuration.

4. the target for config-external is

5. A workaround is required for:

There is a single RPC method used to both create and update block device
mappings in a parent cell.  Based on arguments passed to it it will
either create/update/update_or_create the block device mapping.  This
could cause duplicate bdms to be created if multiple update_or_create
calls come in quickly.  Instead the update_or_create argument should
only be used when sending the first RPC message to the parent cell.

There's additional complexity here in that a bdm object create() call
should create the bdm and all save() calls should update.  However
create() doesn't send an update message if device_name isn't set due to
uniqueness being determined by a combination of instance uuid and device
name.  So save() needs to use update_or_create if device name is being
changed, and update all other times.

a change in Heat that makes Heat inompatible with these older
distro-based versions of MySQL-python.  The patch removes a
migration from the repository which is responsible for the
incompatability.

This has been causing heat to break for a number of users running mariadb 10 - this may be a dependency issue, but reverting this until we work out why things are broken seems the safest course of action.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================== Cisco IMC PXE Driver ==================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ironic/+spec/cisco-imc-pxe-driver This spec proposes adding a new driver which provides out-of-band non-ipmi based control of UCS C-Series servers through CIMC. Problem description =================== Current drivers only allow for control of UCS servers via either IPMI or UCSM, the Cisco UCS C-Series operating in standalone mode can also be controlled via CIMC using its http/s XML API. This provides finer control over the server than IPMI can, and doesn't require the extra infrastructure that UCSM needs. Proposed change =============== Power and Management interfaces will be created that understand how to talk to CIMC, and these will be used in conjunction with the PXE boot interface, ISCSI deploy interface and Agent deploy interface to create pxe_cimc and agent_cimc drivers. The CIMC Power interface will inherit the base PowerInterface and implement: * get_power_state * set_power_state * reboot * get_properties * validate The CIMC Management interface will inherit the base ManagementInterface and implement: * get_properties * validate * get_supported_boot_devices * get_boot_device * set_boot_device * get_sensors_data - This will raise NotImplemented Alternatives ------------ The alternatives are to use the pxe_ipmi or agent_ipmi driver to control the UCS C-Series via IPMI, or install the infrastructure to manage these servers with UCSM and use the pxe_ucs or agent_ucs driver.

Testing ======= Unit tests for the Power and Management interfaces will be provided. Functional testing will be added in the future. Upgrades and Backwards Compatibility ==================================== There should be no compatibility issues introduced by this change. Documentation Impact ==================== * Writing configuration documentation. * Updating Ironic documentation section _`Enabling Drivers`: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ironic/deploy/drivers.html with pxe_cimc and agent_cimc driver related instructions.

On Windows Threshold, a new WMI class was introduced, targeting
VM serial ports.

For this reason, attempting to retrieve serial port connections
fails on Windows Threshold.

This patch fixes the issue by adding an extra check and using the
right WMI class in order to retrieve VM serial ports.

In OpenStack Infra for example, Tempest is already in /opt/git/tempest

To make sure we can get the Glance image ID and use the setter provider,

writes a fake PV tools information prior to live-migration.

The information about the presence of pv driver or version is read
straight though xenstore and written back to xenstore.

This information is checked by xapi (not nova) during live migration.

Move the ResourceTracker._instance_in_resize_state() method to a simple
module-level function, since nothing in the method actually accessed the
resource tracker object anyway, and testing a simple function means we
can test it without the hassle of creating the resource tracker in the
test cases.

Also removes a duplicate test_claim() method from the
test_resource_tracker module that was already in the NoDBTestCase-based
test_tracker.MoveClaimTestCase object. The idea behind this and the next

changing the PciDeviceTracker's constructor and its instantiation in the

The code recently added to clean up the compute monitor loading to use
stevedore was assuming a single type of compute monitor: cpu monitors.
This patch allows multiple monitor types, namespaced by the directory in
nova/compute/monitors. The NUMA memory bandwidth monitor is the next
monitor namespace to be proposed, and this code sets up that patch
series.

DocImpact: This patch provides the infrastructure for non-CPU compute
monitors to be loaded properly by the stevedore extension manager. The
CONF.compute_monitors configuration option previously supported only CPU
monitors, and so the format of the configuration option (which is a
multi-list option) looked like this: CONF.compute_monitors = ['virt_driver'],
which could be read as ""Use the virt_driver CPU monitor"". Now, non-CPU
monitors can be loaded by the extension manager, and so a namespace
prefix is also considered. For example, setting CPU.compute_monitors to
['cpu.virt_driver', 'numa_mem_bw.virt_driver'] would allow the loading
of both the virt_driver CPU monitor and the virt_driver NUMA memory
bandwidth monitor. To preserve backwards compatibility, if there is no
namespace given, the 'cpu.' namespace is assumed.

This change set optimizes how the extended attributes are determined
within the driver.  The Storage XAG is a very expensive extended
attribute, with each query taking a couple seconds.  The MAPPING XAGs
are linear with the number of mappings on the system.

As such, it is best to determine which XAGs are needed ahead of time to
minimize the amount needed to gather.

The behavior is such that a default deploy only needs SCSI Mappings (for
vOpt and local/SSP disks).  The volume adapters vary what they need.
NPIV needs Storage and FC Mappings.  The vSCSI adapter only requires the
SCSI mappings (turns out the Storage mapping is NOT required there -
further testing showed).

Therefore a new method was introduced called _get_inst_xag.  It takes in
some information (including bdms).  If a volume is provided, it will
determine from the volume adapter what XAG attributes are required.

This should significantly speed up all deploys that do not require NPIV
volume adapter connections.  As further volume adapters are added, this
framework should be flexible to handle the new mechanisms as well.

This method also re-introduces a vSCSI optimization that was lost in a
recent refactoring.  It gathers the physical WWPNs once up front and
caches them.

There was a conditional checking either the vm_state or the task_state to see
if it was an IO operation. By thinking on it, there are 5 calls to the scheduler
for asking a destination :
 - build_instances
 - cold_migrate
 - live_migrate
 - unshelve
 - rebuild

All of them will try to find a destination and consume_from_instance() will be
decrementing the host resources by the instance usage, which means it's an I/O
operation anyway.

Also, the current implementation is buggy since a live migration is not
considered as an io_ops (the MIGRATING task_state is missing in the conditional...)
so that's a good opportunity for just saying bye-bye to the conditional.

We'll need to provide dictionary primitives for what I call the
legacy filter_properties and request_spec for 3 reasons :
 - Scheduler RPC API needing a backwards compatibility path in
   case it doesn't understand a RequestSpec object
 - Notifications which will need to be consistent with the

   in one-shot, but rather incrementally.
