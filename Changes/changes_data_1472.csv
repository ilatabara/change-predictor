Previous patch I79d70543856c01a45e2d8c083ab8df6b9c047ebc
implemented filtering of glance ""os_glance..."" metadata
but its logic overlooked the fact that the glance metadata
to be filtered are actually in a ""properties"" sub-dict
as adjusted by the ""_merge_volume_image_meta"" method in
cinder/volume/api.py.

This patch re-invokes the filtering loop on
the ""properties"" sub-dict when it is present.

New unit test covers filtering in both cases.

At the moment only strongswan seems to support disablement of
dpdaction. At the same time, an option to disable it is called `none`
rather then `disabled` [1]. For backwards compatability we don't drop

With that we're adding proper `none` option.

When using a mech_driver that needs dhcp_agent extension
eg. linuxbridge alongside the ovn mech_driver the dhcp
agent extension is disabled. This is not desired as it
will break the other exension driver that needs it.

This is also needed as OVN with barmetal uses dhcp agent.

Especially if there are a lot of port_bindings the metadata agent became

the traffic for those ports that belong to a Security Group.

To implement this with OVN, we created a Port Group 'neutron_pg_drop'
to which we added all the ports that belonged to a Neutron SG.
At scale, this could pose some issues as we could find the PG
with tens of thousands ports affecting the performance.

With this core OVN patch [0], there is the option to reverse the
behavior and Neutron then would need to do the opposite:

- Create a default 'allow' port group and add those ports that
  do not belong to any SG.

- Set the config setting in OVN to change the policy.

- Remove the old 'drop' Port Group

Ideally, this new Port Group will have a lot less ports and
should perform better.

With this new behavior, we also need to have three ""global"" ACLs in every
security group / port group:

- Since now every traffic has to be allowed explicitly, there has to be
  a couple of ACLs that allow ARP and ND packets, one for each
  direction.
- Since [1], traffic in the after load balancer stage has to be allowed
  explicitly.

Please keep in mind that:

- This hasn't been tested
- There's no way to tell from the schema if the core OVN knob is going
  to be honored
- There are cases missing in this current patch (eg. port removed from a
  SG)
- No tests added
- No code accounting for the db sync tool
- Maybe others

This is just a quick PoC.

Commit abe5a289 fixed the rendering of the ironic driver in the
nova-compute.conf file for OpenStack versions >= Wallaby. However, it
always renders the nova-compute.conf file for train and above, which is
hard-coded to the Ironic libvirt driver.

This adds additional templating logic to the nova-compute.conf driver in
order to render the correct driver to use.

This patch is replacing ppa.launchpadcontent.net
by ppa1.novemberain.com.

Reason for replacement is that only latest erlang version
is available on the current ppa source.

Setting Debian ARM jobs non voting for now, since the new ppa
does not contain arm64 packages.

This repo is based on the official Erlang/OTP package
for Debian. The RabbitMQ team adapted the upstream package
to produce packages for more/different combinations of
Erlang/OTP, Debian and Ubuntu releases.

Currently, there is a check if ephemeral-device exists or not.
However, if that option returns non-empty and device is not found
charm code continues the processing without raising an error.

That can lead to confusion that is difficult to change once the
environment is in production.

This change adds a check after: if ephemeral-device is non-empty
but not found, then raise an exception.

While there is a serious issue when v3 API is used for etcd

https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/4961
https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/9949

using v2 API does not solve the problem because there are known issues
in maintaining leader locks:

https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/1184#issuecomment-232433373
(this comment describes intermittent issues with S3 storage and
etcd ha_storage with etcd2 API)
https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/2214#issuecomment-269718252
https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/1908#issuecomment-248686276

This is vaguely documented in the official documentation:

https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/storage/etcd.html
""the Etcd storage backend supports high availability. The v2 API has
known issues with HA support and should not be used in HA scenarios.""

Arguably, having v3 used by default and knowing that the failure of the
first etcd endpoint in an ha_storage connection string will lead to
a vault outage is better than having v2 API used (meaning future v3
migration) with an unpredictable HA behavior.

Therefore, this change makes the API version configurable for a deployer
to decide until V3 API issues are fixed.

ha_enabled does not need to be set as configurable for etcd since
ha_backend has to have ha_enabled set to ""true"" for it to work as an
ha_backend (vault will error out and exit(1) if ha_enabled is false):

This patch is adding a feature for an option to copy different
ceph configuration files and corresponding keyrings for cinder,
glance, manila, gnocchi and nova services.

This is especially useful when the deployment uses availability
zones as below example.

  - Individual compute can read/write to individual ceph
    cluster in same AZ.
  - Cinder can write to several ceph clusters in several AZs.
  - Glance can use multistore and upload images to
    several ceph clusters in several AZs at once.

librbd methods call lower level C code which runs in native code
and isn't aware about the eventlet threads hence hangs the eventlet
loop until the native code is finished.
This could cause problems when we are creating multiple images
with large size where one call to librados can cause the process to
hang and other operations can starve for execution and error out.
This patch wraps each RBD call in it's own native thread that won't
affect other RBD call from executing.

Note that since glance can run under eventlet *or* native threads
with something like uwsgi, this only delegates to an eventlet worker
when we are running in that environment.

Note: This was originally merged as commit
27ab8a6aeb7a59bc56ed0ad26ffb5a83d426b447, but without the handling
for non-eventlet cases.

When OVN is used with OpenStack the end user specifies the desired state of the system by communicating with the Neutron APIs. The HA of Neutron APIs is maintained by the hacluster charm as for other API services. Neutron maintains its own state in a SQL database and this data is made HA by MySQL Innodb Cluster. From OVNs point of view the desired state is dictated by the Cloud Management System (CMS), in this case OpenStack Neutron, and programmed into the OVN Northbound database by workers on the Neutron API nodes. The OVN central control daemon, ovn-northd, reads the high level logical network configuration from the OVN Northbound database and programs it into logical datapath flows in the OVN Southbound database. The charms configure the OVN databases to use the Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) Clustered Database Service Model. To ensure consistency OVSDB uses the Raft algorithm. The charms run multiple copies of the ovn-northd daemon and they will through the use of a locking mechanism in the database make sure that only one of them is active at a time. In the event of the currently active ovn-northd daemon becoming unavailable one of the others standing by will automatically take over. The ovn-central charm deploys the Northbound and Southbound databases along with the ovn-northd daemon. OVN control plane security ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ OVN data plane HA ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Each transport node in the system (chassis), typically a hypervisor in OpenStacks case, runs a local copy of Open vSwitch along with its local OVSDB server which together maintains the run-time state of the system. The local switch is programmed by the OVN local controller, ovn-controller, which connects up to the Southbound database to retrieve configuration data relevant to the chassis it runs on. The ovn-controller process is also placed in the datapath for some types of network control traffic such as DNS queries (to implement internal dns resolution) and DHCP requests. When possible the result of any packet processing done by the ovn-controller will be programmed back into the local Open vSwitch so that any similar flows arriving in the future can be dealt with by the networking stack without involving the ovn-controller process. Tunnels are established to other chassis in the system. Communication between instances in the same virtual network (East/West) flow directly from the chassis the traffic originates from to the chassis the traffic is destined to through these tunnels. Communication to the outside world or instances on other virtual networks (North/South) go through chassis selected as gateway chassis. Chassis are selected as gateways based on a combination of presence of external connectivity and a scheduling algorithm (least loaded or round robin). Other than that a gateway chassis is just like any other chassis and they still host a hypervisor with instances etc. HA for North/South traffic is accomplished by each virtual router being scheduled to up to 5 gateway chassis. Liveness detection between them is implemented using the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection protocol (BFD). It is also possible to configure the system in such a way that North/South traffic to/from instances with a Floating IP will be handled by the chassis that hosts the instance. Depending on your physical networking configuration this may or may not be desirable. As opposed to the Neutron legacy OVS+DVR implementation you do not need to have external connectivity to all hypervisors to get distributed east/west traffic and you can influence which chassis are selected for handling North/South traffic. Minimal deployment example ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",OVN can then be deployed:,39,1

Refactor ``configure_ovs`` to consume ``add_bridge_bond`` and

To be able to safely refactor and extract parts of the
``configure_ovs`` function from the ``neutron-openvswitch`` charm
we need a unit test for configure_ovs that measures its output
to Open vSwitch.

The Open vSwitch CLI provided by ``ovs-vsctl`` is rich, and multiple
combinations and orders of arguments can be used to accomplish
exactly the same programming of the system.

A side effect of any refactoring of this part of the code will lead
to change in order of which things are called, so we want to be able
to test that the expected set of ``ovs-vsctl`` sentences are called
regardless of in which order they arrive.

Debugging Hash Ring problems can be difficult challenge given that prior
to this patch the logs were very limited.

This patch improves the logging for this feature as follow:

1. Log when a node is added to the ring
2. Log when nodes are removed from the ring
3. Keep track the number of offline nodes and log it upon loading the
   ring
4. Improve the ""Hash Ring is empty"" exception with the number of offline
   nodes found (if 0, means the ovn_hash_ring table has no entries)

RBD snapshots automatically end up in the trash
when deleted when using RBD image format v2.

However, they prevent images from being deleted.

Instead, move RBD images to the trash in this
situation.  This trash must be purged by a scheduled
rbd trash purge operation outside of Glance.

This passes new cinder<->image dependency tests in
I5fee2395195 when using ceph require-min-compat-client
of ""mimic"", which enables clone v2.

Nova's instances directory may be a shared directory (ie nfs), in
these cases, we do not want to clean out the directory.

This patch introduces the parameter SHARED_INSTANCE_DIR. This value can
be set to True or False (defaults to False). If set to True, nova instances
directory is treated as shared and will not be deleted; otherwise, it will be
deleted when stack.sh is invoked.

As of now a single attempt is made to obtain gnocchiclient, if
this request fails due any intermittent issue, ceilometer fails to
load gnocchi publisher.

This change uses tenacity to retry fetching gnocchiclient if it
fails with keystone exceptions ""ServiceUnavailable"",

When passing custom properties that are not strings to image-create,
image-create-via-import and image-update, we get the following error:

---8<------------------------------------------------------------------
$ glance image-create --name myimg --property min_ram=123
Unable to set 'min_ram' to '123'. Reason: '123' is not of type 'integer'

Failed validating 'type' in schema['properties']['min_ram']:
    {'description': 'Amount of ram (in MB) required to boot image.',
     'type': 'integer'}

On instance['min_ram']:
    '123'
---8<------------------------------------------------------------------

Because we get custom properties through the command line, they all
default to being strings, which means warlock cannot properly validate
their types.

Furthermore, warlock does not check the readOnly attribute of the
jsonschema, which means it will not complain if we try to set the value
of a read-only property, thus making one useless API call and taking
time to give feedback to the user:

---8<------------------------------------------------------------------
$ time glance image-create --name myimg --property updated_at=foo
HTTP 403 Forbidden: Attribute &#x27;updated_at&#x27; is read-only.

real    0m1.191s
user    0m0.503s
sys     0m0.063s
---8<------------------------------------------------------------------

This patch makes sure that:
- integer properties are cast from string to integer before they have to
  be validated by Warlock;
- we exit early if a read-only property is given on the command line;
- we do not repeat ourselves by factorising this code in
  _populate_properties.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================================================== External Authentication Server OAuth2.0 Grant Support ===================================================== Provides a capability for the third-party end-users authenticated by an External Authentication Server via the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant in `RFC6749 OAuth 2.0 Authentication Framework` [#oauth2_specification]_ to access the protected OpenStack service directly. Problem Description =================== The current OAuth2.0 in keystone middleware only supports Keystone as an authorization server. In other words, Keystone users cannot use a third-party authorization server (such as Keycloak [#keycloak]_). This limitation reduces the benefit of supporting OAuth2.0 which defines general procedures of authorization so that an API server can use various authorization servers supporting OAuth2.0. Thus, it is necessary to improve the interoperability of OAuth2.0 in Keystone by allowing the use of a third-party authorization server. Proposed Change =============== The proposed change is to add a new keystone middleware that implements RFC7662 OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection [#token_introspection]_ and allows users to optionally use that middleware when using an external authorization server. Terminology ----------- - *Administrator:* The administrators of the External Authentication Server who can create clients, roles, users, and set the scopes that each user can access. - *Client:* The application that is managed by the External Authentication Server, and can access the protected OpenStack service on behalf of the user. - *User:* The end-users who are managed by the External Authentication Server, and can access the protected OpenStack service. - *Access Token:* A token used by the end-users to make protected resource requests with the delegated roles. - *Service credentials:* The credential used by the application with a grant type of Client Credentials. With this credential the application can access the introspect APIs provided by the External Authentication Server. - *User credentials:* The credential used by the end-user with a grant type of Resource Owner Password Credentials. This grant type is suitable for clients capable of obtaining the resource owner's credentials (username and password, typically using an interactive form). External Authentication Server OAuth2.0 Grant Preparation Flow -------------------------------------------------------------- .. seqdiag:: seqdiag { Administrator; AuthServer [label = ""External\nAuthentication\nServer""]; Administrator -> AuthServer [label = ""1. create service credentials""]; Administrator <-- AuthServer [label = ""Response 201 Created\n service credentials""]; Administrator -> AuthServer [label = ""2. create user credentials""]; Administrator <-- AuthServer [label = ""Response 201 Created\n user credentials""]; } The prepare flow consists of the following steps as illustrated in the above sequence: #. A administrator user creates a service credentials, and maintain relevant information for resource access control, such as roles, groups, scopes, tokens, certificates, etc. #. A administrator user creates a user credentials, and maintain relevant information, such as roles, attributes, etc. External Authentication Server OAuth2.0 Grant Flow -------------------------------------------------- .. seqdiag:: seqdiag { User; AuthServer [label = ""External\nAuthentication\nServer""]; ""Keystone Middleware""; ""OpenStack Service""; User -> AuthServer [label = ""1. request\n Token API\n with user credentials""]; User <-- AuthServer [label = ""Response 200 OK\n with Access Token""]; User -> ""OpenStack Service"" [label = ""2. request\n OpenStack Service API\n with Access Token""]; ""OpenStack Service"" -> ""Keystone Middleware"" [label = ""3. verify the Access Token""]; ""Keystone Middleware"" -> AuthServer [label = ""4. request\n Introspect API\n with service credentials\n and the Access Token""]; ""Keystone Middleware"" <-- AuthServer [label = ""Response 200 OK\n with Access Token metadata""]; ""Keystone Middleware"" -> ""Keystone Middleware"" [label = ""5. parse\n the necessary\n information\n from the metadata""]; ""Keystone Middleware"" -> ""Keystone Middleware"" [label = ""6. set\n request.environ\n with the necessary\n information""]; ""OpenStack Service"" <-- ""Keystone Middleware"" [label = ""return request.environ\n with the necessary\n information""]; ""OpenStack Service"" -> ""OpenStack Service"" [label = ""7. continue\n OpenStack\n Service\n processing""]; ""User"" <-- ""OpenStack Service"" [label = ""Response 200 OK""]; } The flow consists of the following steps as illustrated in the above sequence: #. The end-user authenticates with the External Authentication Server and requests a new OAuth2.0 Access Token. #. The end-user uses the OAuth2.0 Access Token to make requests for OpenStack Service APIs. #. The OpenStack Service use Keystone Middleware to validate the Access Token. #. Keystone Middleware sends a request to the External Authentication Server to verify if the Access Token is active and to obtain the metadata for the Access Token. If validation fails, Keystone Middleware sends an error response directly to the end-user, such as ""401 Unauthorized"". In general, end-users will send multiple requests using the same Access Token, so to provide performance, the metadata can be saved to a local cache such as the Memcached Server. Keystone Middleware access the External Authentication Server via Client Credentials, therefore, it is necessary to use the auth_method that the External Authentication Server allows, such as SSL, Mutual-TLS, client_secret_basic, client_secret_post, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, etc. #. Keystone Middleware uses the mapping definition in the config file to parse all the necessary information from the metadata. If parsing fails, Keystone Middleware sends an error response directly to the end-user, such as ""403 Forbidden"". #. Keystone Middleware sets the environment variables in the OpenStack service HTTP request with the required information. #. After verifying the access token, the OpenStack applies the matching policy according to the request environment variable, and continues the subsequent business processing, and finally sends the response to the end-user. Alternatives ------------ * The delegated mode in the Keystone Middleware [#delegated_mode]_ can be used to handle request that needs an external authorization server. In this case, no changes to the Keystone Middleware are needed and an API server will perform the token introspection instead. However, the proposed features in the present document doesn't impair the current Keystone Middleware, but rather is beneficial feature for the OpenStack users. Security Impact --------------- * During the OAuth2.0 Grant flow, some sensitive values are sent in plain text. Thus, Keystone using this feature must enable HTTPS. * Check the security requirements of a third-party authorization server and do not access vulnerable one. Notifications Impact -------------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- * Enables the use OAuth2.0 access token for the External Authentication Server from the settings of Keystone Middleware without using API. These configurations are shown in the part of Other Deployer Impact. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- Configuration of Keystone Middleware ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ To use OAuth2.0 access token for the External Authentication Server, a deployer has to configure Keystone Middleware by changing ``[filter:authtoken]`` in ``/etc/tacker/api-paste.ini`` as shown below. :: [filter:authtoken] paste.filter_factory=keystonemiddleware.external_oauth2_token:filter_factory .. note:: If the Openstack services require authorization to an external authorization server through Keystone Middleware, the config for each service must be changed. This section shows how to set up Tacker as an example. In order for Keystone Middleware to access the External Authentication Server for token verification and to obtain metadata, has to configure Keystone Middleware by appending some options in ``/etc/tacker/tacker.conf`` as shown below. Regarding the option ``auth_method`` may need to support the following: client_secret_basic, client_secret_post, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, etc. :: [keystone_authtoken] memcached_servers=localhost:11211 introspect_endpoint=https://keycloak/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect cacert=/opt/stack/keycloak_ca.pem key=/opt/stack/tacker_client.key cert=/opt/stack/tacker_client.pem auth_method=client_secret_basic client_id=tacker_client_id client_secret=tacker_client_secret jwt_key=/opt/stack/jwt.pem jwt_algorithm=S256 mapping_domain_id=domain_id mapping_domain_name=domain_name mapping_project_id=tenant_id mapping_project_name=tenant_name mapping_project_domain_id=domain_id mapping_project_domain_name=domain_name mapping_tenant_id=tenant_id mapping_tenant_name=tenant_name mapping_provider_id=provider_id mapping_provider_name=provider_name mapping_user_id=user_id mapping_user_name=username mapping_user_domain_id=domain_id mapping_user_domain_name=domain_name mapping_roles=roles Configuration of Keystoneauth ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In order for OpenStack Command to access the External Authentication Server to get an OAuth2.0 Access Token, has to configure Keystoneauth by appending some fields to the environment variable of the operating system as shown below. :: export OS_AUTH_TYPE=v3externaloauth2password export OS_EXTERNAL_OAUTH2_ENDPOINT=https://keycloak/protocol/openid-connect/token export OS_EXTERNAL_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=333e5ae19cbb47e8b18969306582be25 export OS_EXTERNAL_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=333e5ae19cbb47e8b18969306582be25 export OS_EXTERNAL_OAUTH2_CACERT=/opt/stack/keycloak_ca.pem export OS_EXTERNAL_OAUTH2_CERT=/opt/stack/client.pem export OS_EXTERNAL_OAUTH2_KEY=/opt/stack/client.key export OS_EXTERNAL_OAUTH2_USER_NAME=admin export OS_EXTERNAL_OAUTH2_PASSWORD=test Developer Impact ---------------- None * There is no impact on other Openstack developers and backend services.

There are obvious differences with other authentication methods, After the authentication ispassed, if the subsequent request is sent via HTTPS protocol by the session, the ""Authorization"" field with an OAuth2.0 access token is automatically added to the request headers.

Xena branch is in Extended Maintenance now[1]. Tempest and
tempest plugins are branchless which means master version of
Tempest and its plugins is used to test the supported stable
branches.

Once any stable branch is moved to EM state then, Tempest and
its plugins compatible tag[2] needs to be released so that we can
keep testing the EM stable branches with that tag once master
Tempest and its plugins are not compatible[3].

Tagging 'xena-last' with the latest hash which is nothing but 2.7.1

Business Case ------------- The official language of OpenStack is United States English (en-us). End-user-facing strings in both the web UI and in responses from the OpenStack APIs appear by default in en-us. This can be a barrier to non-native English readers who would otherwise like to use an OpenStack cloud. Sponsoring an engineer to adapt the current translations infrastructure from Zanata to Weblate is a way to visibly demonstrate your commitment to the OpenStack community and investment in support for its translation to other languages. Technical Details ----------------- There are two Zuul CI jobs that exist today: upstream-translation-update and propose-translation-update [0]. upstream-translation-update operates in a source repository and generates a gettext .pot translations file for that repo then uploads those to Zanata [1]. This is the piece that takes information from the git repos and puts it in Zanata so that translators know what needs to be translated. propose-translation-update operates in a source repository and fetches .po files containing translated strings for various languages and synchronizes them into the git repositories then pushes the result to Gerrit for review [2]. Unfortunately, the end result here is a bit of spaghetti. A possibly incomplete list of bits that come into play here: [3][4][5]. Much of this isn't actually Zanata specific and can be reused. We suspect that the bulk of the work in switching to Weblate is updating these scripts [1][2] to talk to Weblate. Additionally, reorganizing things to be more centralized and easier to maintain would be helpful. Another approach would be to build new jobs from scratch copying what is useful from the old Zanata stuff. Then we can run both sets of jobs in parallel as part of the transition ; this also has the upside of allowing you to refactor from the start.

This patch adds support to revert to snapshot for NFS, FC and
iSCSI drivers with FlexVol pool.

Adds a method on client_cmode to rename a NFS volume file using
the file-rename-file zapi call.

The revert steps are:
  1. Create a clone volume file/LUN from snapshot.
  2. Change the original volume file/LUN path to a temporary path.
  3. Change clone file/LUN path to the original path.
  4. Delete the volume file/LUN on temporary path.

If any step fails, the original volume file/LUN is preserved and
the clone file/LUN is deleted.

For NFS, ONTAP clone file is not supported on FlexGroup pool, in
this case the generic implementation will perform the revert to
snapshot.

Juju >= 3.1 and ops >= 2.1.0 support opening of ports for K8S
operators using the open-port hook commands.

Switch away from use of k8s service patcher for this purpose;
this probably means that most OpenStack K8S operators can now

The existing method of exposing the default ingress port is
supported as well as the ability to provide a charm specific

This patch fixes a condition where iRMC driver interfaces would have
the FIPS enforcement logic check applied if the SNMP version was not
set to SNMP v3, even if the interfaces did not use SNMP.

With this patch, if FIPS enabled, iRMC driver enforces SNMP
version to be version 3 only when any xxx_interface of iRMC
driver actually uses SNMP.

if some container build needs to downgrade gnutls version.

This is a patch that adds a new LVM/nvmet job which also
exercises a few relevant code paths in os-brick
which are likely to be used in a production environment:

- Uses the new NVMe-oF connection information.

- Uses NVMe-oF native multipathing, even if it's by using the local IP
  address, which is not real multipathing.

- Shares the namespace for all connections on the same node.

- Add support for credentials per project groups
- Add support for base api to receive a client in base.
- Update existing testcase for volume capability with persona
- Add new project client based on persona for resource manage

Tempest allocates the credentials per project groups,
The class testcase pick a persona to test, allocate
resources with required client (admin or others)
we will be able to allocate any resource from any project
scope because base api accepts the client.

We can reuse the code and run the same tests with differnet
personas by inheritence.

This commit adds some trivial protection tests for volume operations
with the default role and scope permutations possible from keystone and
available by default through tempest and devstack.

Some of these tests are execising the read-only role in keystone, which
is going to fail until we update cinder's policies to do valid role
checking for writeable operations. For now, those tests are skipped and
we will remove the skips as we incrementally work through cinder's
policies and implememnt default roles.

crush_rule delegate task fails while looking for
assimilate_ceph.conf in few controller nodes and
few tasks fails with permission issues.

This patch
 - will not bind mount assimilate_ceph.conf in the generated
tripleo_cephadm_ceph_cli while applying crush rules.
 - uses right permissions for crush_rule tasks
 - uses default crush rule.name 'replicated_rule' in 'create

This patch deals with overlooked situation in patch
d23f72ee501a5bdcc89806eb0ebbba929a36e64d, in which
`irmc_ipmi_succeed` flag is added to deal with iRMC
firmware's IPMI incompatibility introduced at iRMC
firmware version S6 2.00 and later.
That flag is set and updated by `irmc` power_interface
code and rest of iRMC driver code use that flag.

When `ipmitool` is set as power_interface, that flag
is not set nor updated and rest of iRMC driver code
fail to handle IPMI incompatibility correctly.

This patch adds logic to check power_interface to
make iRMC driver properly deal with iRMC firmware's IPMI
incompatibility even when `ipmitool` power_interface
is used.

""""""# KubernetesServicePatch Library. This library is designed to enable developers to more simply patch the Kubernetes Service created by Juju during the deployment of a sidecar charm. When sidecar charms are deployed, Juju creates a service named after the application in the namespace (named after the Juju model). This service by default contains a ""placeholder"" port, which is 65536/TCP. When modifying the default set of resources managed by Juju, one must consider the lifecycle of the charm. In this case, any modifications to the default service (created during deployment), will be overwritten during a charm upgrade. When initialised, this library binds a handler to the parent charm's `install` and `upgrade_charm` events which applies the patch to the cluster. This should ensure that the service ports are correct throughout the charm's life. The constructor simply takes a reference to the parent charm, and a list of [`lightkube`](https://github.com/gtsystem/lightkube) ServicePorts that each define a port for the service. For information regarding the `lightkube` `ServicePort` model, please visit the `lightkube` [docs](https://gtsystem.github.io/lightkube-models/1.23/models/core_v1/#serviceport). Optionally, a name of the service (in case service name needs to be patched as well), labels, selectors, and annotations can be provided as keyword arguments. ## Getting Started To get started using the library, you just need to fetch the library using `charmcraft`. **Note that you also need to add `lightkube` and `lightkube-models` to your charm's `requirements.txt`.** ```shell cd some-charm charmcraft fetch-lib charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch cat << EOF >> requirements.txt lightkube lightkube-models EOF ``` Then, to initialise the library: For `ClusterIP` services: ```python # ... from charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch import KubernetesServicePatch from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort class SomeCharm(CharmBase): def __init__(self, *args): # ... port = ServicePort(443, name=f""{self.app.name}"") self.service_patcher = KubernetesServicePatch(self, [port]) # ... ``` For `LoadBalancer`/`NodePort` services: ```python # ... from charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch import KubernetesServicePatch from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort class SomeCharm(CharmBase): def __init__(self, *args): # ... port = ServicePort(443, name=f""{self.app.name}"", targetPort=443, nodePort=30666) self.service_patcher = KubernetesServicePatch( self, [port], ""LoadBalancer"" ) # ... ``` Port protocols can also be specified. Valid protocols are `""TCP""`, `""UDP""`, and `""SCTP""` ```python # ... from charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch import KubernetesServicePatch from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort class SomeCharm(CharmBase): def __init__(self, *args): # ... tcp = ServicePort(443, name=f""{self.app.name}-tcp"", protocol=""TCP"") udp = ServicePort(443, name=f""{self.app.name}-udp"", protocol=""UDP"") sctp = ServicePort(443, name=f""{self.app.name}-sctp"", protocol=""SCTP"") self.service_patcher = KubernetesServicePatch(self, [tcp, udp, sctp]) # ... ``` Bound with custom events by providing `refresh_event` argument: For example, you would like to have a configurable port in your charm and want to apply service patch every time charm config is changed. ```python from charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch import KubernetesServicePatch from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort class SomeCharm(CharmBase): def __init__(self, *args): # ... port = ServicePort(int(self.config[""charm-config-port""]), name=f""{self.app.name}"") self.service_patcher = KubernetesServicePatch( self, [port], refresh_event=self.on.config_changed ) # ... ``` Additionally, you may wish to use mocks in your charm's unit testing to ensure that the library does not try to make any API calls, or open any files during testing that are unlikely to be present, and could break your tests. The easiest way to do this is during your test `setUp`: ```python # ... @patch(""charm.KubernetesServicePatch"", lambda x, y: None) def setUp(self, *unused): self.harness = Harness(SomeCharm) # ... ``` """""" import logging from types import MethodType from typing import List, Literal, Optional, Union from lightkube import ApiError, Client from lightkube.core import exceptions from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort, ServiceSpec from lightkube.models.meta_v1 import ObjectMeta from lightkube.resources.core_v1 import Service from lightkube.types import PatchType from ops.charm import CharmBase from ops.framework import BoundEvent, Object logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) # The unique Charmhub library identifier, never change it LIBID = ""0042f86d0a874435adef581806cddbbb"" # Increment this major API version when introducing breaking changes LIBAPI = 1 # Increment this PATCH version before using `charmcraft publish-lib` or reset # to 0 if you are raising the major API version LIBPATCH = 6 ServiceType = Literal[""ClusterIP"", ""LoadBalancer""] class KubernetesServicePatch(Object): """"""A utility for patching the Kubernetes service set up by Juju."""""" def __init__( self, charm: CharmBase, ports: List[ServicePort], service_name: Optional[str] = None, service_type: ServiceType = ""ClusterIP"", additional_labels: Optional[dict] = None, additional_selectors: Optional[dict] = None, additional_annotations: Optional[dict] = None, *, refresh_event: Optional[Union[BoundEvent, List[BoundEvent]]] = None, ): """"""Constructor for KubernetesServicePatch.

This patch configures ironic-conductor to send a service token along
with the received user token on requests to other services. This allow
those other services to accept the request even if the user token has
been invalidated since received by Ironic. Also with this patch Ironic
will accept request from other services with invalid user tokens but

""""""# KubernetesServicePatch Library. This library is designed to enable developers to more simply patch the Kubernetes Service created by Juju during the deployment of a sidecar charm. When sidecar charms are deployed, Juju creates a service named after the application in the namespace (named after the Juju model). This service by default contains a ""placeholder"" port, which is 65536/TCP. When modifying the default set of resources managed by Juju, one must consider the lifecycle of the charm. In this case, any modifications to the default service (created during deployment), will be overwritten during a charm upgrade. When initialised, this library binds a handler to the parent charm's `install` and `upgrade_charm` events which applies the patch to the cluster. This should ensure that the service ports are correct throughout the charm's life. The constructor simply takes a reference to the parent charm, and a list of [`lightkube`](https://github.com/gtsystem/lightkube) ServicePorts that each define a port for the service. For information regarding the `lightkube` `ServicePort` model, please visit the `lightkube` [docs](https://gtsystem.github.io/lightkube-models/1.23/models/core_v1/#serviceport). Optionally, a name of the service (in case service name needs to be patched as well), labels, selectors, and annotations can be provided as keyword arguments. ## Getting Started To get started using the library, you just need to fetch the library using `charmcraft`. **Note that you also need to add `lightkube` and `lightkube-models` to your charm's `requirements.txt`.** ```shell cd some-charm charmcraft fetch-lib charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch cat << EOF >> requirements.txt lightkube lightkube-models EOF ``` Then, to initialise the library: For `ClusterIP` services: ```python # ... from charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch import KubernetesServicePatch from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort class SomeCharm(CharmBase): def __init__(self, *args): # ... port = ServicePort(443, name=f""{self.app.name}"") self.service_patcher = KubernetesServicePatch(self, [port]) # ... ``` For `LoadBalancer`/`NodePort` services: ```python # ... from charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch import KubernetesServicePatch from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort class SomeCharm(CharmBase): def __init__(self, *args): # ... port = ServicePort(443, name=f""{self.app.name}"", targetPort=443, nodePort=30666) self.service_patcher = KubernetesServicePatch( self, [port], ""LoadBalancer"" ) # ... ``` Port protocols can also be specified. Valid protocols are `""TCP""`, `""UDP""`, and `""SCTP""` ```python # ... from charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch import KubernetesServicePatch from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort class SomeCharm(CharmBase): def __init__(self, *args): # ... tcp = ServicePort(443, name=f""{self.app.name}-tcp"", protocol=""TCP"") udp = ServicePort(443, name=f""{self.app.name}-udp"", protocol=""UDP"") sctp = ServicePort(443, name=f""{self.app.name}-sctp"", protocol=""SCTP"") self.service_patcher = KubernetesServicePatch(self, [tcp, udp, sctp]) # ... ``` Bound with custom events by providing `refresh_event` argument: For example, you would like to have a configurable port in your charm and want to apply service patch every time charm config is changed. ```python from charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch import KubernetesServicePatch from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort class SomeCharm(CharmBase): def __init__(self, *args): # ... port = ServicePort(int(self.config[""charm-config-port""]), name=f""{self.app.name}"") self.service_patcher = KubernetesServicePatch( self, [port], refresh_event=self.on.config_changed ) # ... ``` Additionally, you may wish to use mocks in your charm's unit testing to ensure that the library does not try to make any API calls, or open any files during testing that are unlikely to be present, and could break your tests. The easiest way to do this is during your test `setUp`: ```python # ... @patch(""charm.KubernetesServicePatch"", lambda x, y: None) def setUp(self, *unused): self.harness = Harness(SomeCharm) # ... ``` """""" import logging from types import MethodType from typing import List, Literal, Optional, Union from lightkube import ApiError, Client from lightkube.core import exceptions from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort, ServiceSpec from lightkube.models.meta_v1 import ObjectMeta from lightkube.resources.core_v1 import Service from lightkube.types import PatchType from ops.charm import CharmBase from ops.framework import BoundEvent, Object logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) # The unique Charmhub library identifier, never change it LIBID = ""0042f86d0a874435adef581806cddbbb"" # Increment this major API version when introducing breaking changes LIBAPI = 1 # Increment this PATCH version before using `charmcraft publish-lib` or reset # to 0 if you are raising the major API version LIBPATCH = 6 ServiceType = Literal[""ClusterIP"", ""LoadBalancer""] class KubernetesServicePatch(Object): """"""A utility for patching the Kubernetes service set up by Juju."""""" def __init__( self, charm: CharmBase, ports: List[ServicePort], service_name: Optional[str] = None, service_type: ServiceType = ""ClusterIP"", additional_labels: Optional[dict] = None, additional_selectors: Optional[dict] = None, additional_annotations: Optional[dict] = None, *, refresh_event: Optional[Union[BoundEvent, List[BoundEvent]]] = None, ): """"""Constructor for KubernetesServicePatch.

This patch fixes a condition where iRMC driver interfaces would have
the FIPS enforcement logic check applied if the SNMP version was not
set to SNMP v3, even if the interfaces did not use SNMP.

With this patch, if FIPS enabled, iRMC driver enforces SNMP
version to be version 3 only when any xxx_interface of iRMC
driver actually uses SNMP.

Xena branch is in Extended Maintenance now[1]. Tempest and
tempest plugins are branchless which means master version of
Tempest and its plugins is used to test the supported stable
branches.

Once any stable branch is moved to EM state then, Tempest and
its plugins compatible tag[2] needs to be released so that we can
keep testing the EM stable branches with that tag once master
Tempest and its plugins are not compatible[3].

Tagging 'xena-last' with the latest hash which is nothing but 1.6.0
tag.

There are some issues with NDB when multiple IPs are added/removed
from the NICs that may lead to the problem reported in [1]. This
can be caused by live migration of VMs due to bug [2].

It seems by just moving the next methods to IPRoute we can avoid
the NDB hang that in turns caused the privsep thread to hang,
stopping the agent for processing further events:
- set_device_status
- add_ip_to_dev

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================== Support attribute API ===================== This spec adds a new API to update the device vgpu_type. Problem description =================== So far, we manage vgpu_type by configuring gpu_devices[1]_ and need configure the vgpu_type for every GPU. When we change the vgpu_type, we have to restart the cyborg-agent service. Which is complex and uneasy to change as more and more GPUs are required nowadays. In addition, when we change the vgpu_type configuration if the GPU has been allocated to VM, the GPU report task will raise exception. Use Cases --------- 1.An admin or operator wants to change the vgpu_type convenient. 2.An admin or operator cannot change the vgpu_type if the GPU is using. Proposed change =============== For the case 1, we can provider an API to change the vgpu_type for the single GPU, and call the cyborg-agent the period task to report the new info, making the vgpu_type effective immediately. For the case 2, we can check the GPU usage state before change its vgpu_type, if the GPU is using, we forbidden to change the vgpu_type. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- * Add new column `vgpu_type` for the devices table. The column is StringField type and store the vgpu_type info like `{'vgpu_type': 'nvidia-180'}`. REST API impact --------------- URL: ``/v2/devices/{uuid}`` METHOD: ``PATCH`` Update vgpu_type for the device.

Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- No need to configure the vpgu_type for cyborg-agent. Developer impact ---------------- If the user want to use these feature, they should upgrade their Cyborg project to latest to support these changes. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: songwenping Work Items ---------- * Change Cyborg Device table. * Add API of patching vgpu_type for the device. * Change cyborgclient to support change vgpu_type action. * Add related tests.

Infinidat Cinder driver truncates the list of configured iSCSI
portals and returns only the first IP for a given network space.
And in case of network path failure we lose access to the data.

To fix this issue, we need to return all configured and enabled
iSCSI portals for a given configured network space.

In case glance services are configured as a shared service as part of a
region config, images are cached in the secondary region and future
requests for those images go to the cache.

These changes are transparent to the primary region cloud, so it should
work with any 3rd party openstack solution.

a probe namespace. Instead, just try and use any namespace

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================== Link Compute Objects by ID ========================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/compute-object-ids Nova has long had a dependency on an unchanging hostname on the compute nodes. This spec aims to address this limitation, at least from the perspective of being able to detect an accidental change and avoiding catastrophe in the database that can currently result from a hostname change, whether intentional or not. As a continuation of the effort to `robustify compute hostnames`_, this spec describes the next phase which involves strengthening the linkage between the primary database objects managed by the compute nodes. Problem description =================== The `ComputeNode`, `Service`, and `Instance` objects form the primary data model for our compute nodes. Instances run on compute nodes, which are managed by services. We rely on this hierarchy to know where instances are (physically) as well as which RPC endpoint to send messages to for management. Currently, the linkage between all three objects is a relatively loose and string-based, association using the hostname of the compute node and/or the `CONF.host` values. This not only makes an actual/intentional rename very difficult, but also risks breaking critical links as a result of an *accidental* one. Use Cases --------- As an operator I want an accidental or transient hostname rename to not cause corruption of my Nova data structures. As a developer, I want a stronger association between the primary objects in the data model for robustness and performance reasons. Proposed change =============== We already have a `service_id` field on our `ComputeNode` object. We should resume populating that when we create a new `ComputeNode` and we should fix existing records during `ComputeManager.init_host()`, similar to how we added checks for hostname discrepancies in the earlier phase of this effort. We will need to add a `compute_id` field to the `Instance` object, which will require a schema migration. This field will need to remain nullable, and will be `NULL` for instances before scheduling, as well as instances in `SHELVED_OFFLOADED` state. The `compute_id` field can be populated at the same time we currently set `Instance.host`, and similar to `ComputeNode` records above, we can migrate existing records during `ComputeManager._init_instance()`. It is important to note that this spec defines one part of a two-part effort. The setup described here will require a subsequent step to change how we look up these objects to use the new relationships once all the data has been migrated. Alternatives ------------ This is not *required* for proper operation, so we could choose to do nothing. We could also choose to keep the string-based association, strengthened by Foreign Key relationships. Data model impact ----------------- All changes will be confined to the Cell database: * Instance will grow a `compute_id` field * ComputeNode's existing `service_id` field will be populated * Both will be populated during new record creation, and for existing records at runtime during `nova-compute` startup. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ While not the primary intent, a follow-on effort to this will enable querying these objects by integer ID relation instead of by string, which should be both faster as well as lower impact on the database server. Other deployer impact --------------------- No additional deployer impact other than a tiny amount of online data migration traffic on the next startup after upgrade, as well as improved performance and robustness going forward once the effort is completed. Developer impact ---------------- Some additional re-learning about the relationships between the objects being based on IDs instead of hostnames. Upgrade impact -------------- No real upgrade impact here, other than what is already expected. A simple and database migration will be added, with no specific requirements about ordering or simultaneous code change. Compute nodes will migrate existing records during the first post-upgrade restart. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: danms Work Items ---------- * Start populating `ComputeNode.service_id` on creation * Migrate existing `ComputeNode` objects on startup (`init_host()`) * Add a migration to add the `Instance.compute_id` field * Start populating `Instance.compute_id` on completion of scheduling * Migrate existing `Instance` objects on startup (`_init_instance()`) Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Unit and Functional tests will be added to verify that new and existing objects are properly linked and migrated.

When this happen we need to run

The libvirt container image used for the subject container
no longer contains dumb-init in its entrypoint, because
other (not init-like) containers that use it, run in the host
pid namespace.

Add dumb-init to the migration target container directly as it
doesn't run in the host pid ns.

Problem description
===================

It is not possible to create multiple rating types
for the same metric in Gnocchi, which forces operators
to create multiple metrics for the same resource type in
Gnocchi to create different rating types in Cloudkitty for
the same resource type in Gnocchi.

Proposal
========

We propose to extend the Gnocchi collector to allow operators
to create multiple rating types for the same metric in Gnocchi.
Using this approach we can create, for example, a rating type
for software licenses in a running instance and another rating
type for the instance flavor; it can be implemented using only
one metric in Gnocchi which has the instance installed softwares
and flavor metadata.

Xena branch is in Extended Maintenance now[1]. Tempest and
tempest plugins are branchless which means master version of
Tempest and its plugins is used to test the supported stable
branches.

Once any stable branch is moved to EM state then, Tempest and
its plugins compatible tag[2] needs to be released so that we can
keep testing the EM stable branches with that tag once master
Tempest and its plugins are not compatible[3].

Tagging 'xena-last' with the latest hash which is nothing but 4.7.1

It is recommended that you get familiar with them. Rating ------ It is the process of assigning a monetary value to the consumption of a computing resources. CloudKitty uses the concepts of services, which are rated. Therefore, one can configured services to be collected/monitored, and then through its processes, we can assign monetary values to the service consumption. Modules ------- Define the rating processes that are enabled. To get to know more about the rating modules, one should check `rating modules`_ . .. _rating modules: ../user/rating/index.html Services -------- Define the metrics that are collected in a storage backend, and that are then rated by CloudKitty. Services need to be defined via API to be processed later by the rating modules, and configured in the collectors to be captured. Services are configured to be collected in the ``metrics.yml`` file. More information about service creation can be found at `service configuration page`_ .. _service configuration page: ../admin/configuration/configuration.html Groups ------ Define sets of services that should be charged together. Therefore, once a group rating rule is configure, the charge of the group is going to be applied together with the service charge. Fields ------ Define the attributes that are retrieved together with the service collection that can be used to activate a rating rule. PyScripts --------- It is an alternative method to write rating rule. When writing PyScripts, one will be able to handle the complete processing of the rating. Therefore, no need to create services, fields, and groups in cloudKitty. The PyScript logic should take care of all that. Rating rules ------------ Are the expressions used to create a charge (assign a monetary value to a computing resource consumption). Rating rules can be created with PyScripts or with the use of fields, services and groups with hashmap rating rules. Rating type ----------- Is the expression used to determine a service definition in the collection backend. For instance, one can use the following syntax in the ``metrics.yml`` file. The entry ``dynamic_pollster.compute.services.instance.status`` is the definition for rating types. In the example e show here, there are two rating types being defined, one called ``instance-usage-hours`` and the other called ``instance-operating-system-license``. The rating types are configured in CloudKitty API as services. If they are not configured, they will not be rated by rating rules defined with hashmap. Therefore, they would be collected, and persisted with value (price) as zero. .. code-block:: yaml metrics: dynamic_pollster.compute.services.instance.status: - unit: instance alt_name: instance-usage-hours description: ""compute"" groupby: - id - display_name - flavor_id - flavor_name - user_id - project_id - revision_start - availability_zone metadata: - image_ref - flavor_vcpus - flavor_ram - operating_system_name - operating_system_distro - operating_system_type - operating_system_version - mssql_version extra_args: aggregation_method: max resource_type: instance use_all_resource_revisions: false - unit: license-hours alt_name: ""instance-operating-system-license"" description: ""license"" groupby: - id - display_name - flavor_id - flavor_name - user_id - project_id - revision_start - availability_zone - operating_system_distro - operating_system_name metadata: - image_ref - flavor_vcpus - flavor_ram - operating_system_type - operating_system_version extra_args: aggregation_method: max resource_type: instance use_all_resource_revisions: false ",,186,9

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =============================================== Cyborg NVIDIA GPU Driver support MIG management =============================================== GPU MIG is the new feature of A serial card, MIG can partition the GPU into as many as seven instances, each fully isolated with its own high-bandwidth memory, cache, and compute cores[1]_. Its virtualization need enable SRIOV like QAT and SmartNIC, which is different from V100 and other GPU cards. This spec proposes the specification of supporting MIG management in the nvidia mig driver. Problem description =================== GPU MIG is the new feature of A serial card and has different virtualization type from V serial and other GPU cards. We need a new driver to manage MIG resources by Cyborg like other accelerators. Use Cases --------- An admin or operator wants to use the MIG resource like other vGPU resources, and boots up VM with MIG device attached. Proposed change =============== Add new driver to manage MIG resources. 1.collect raw info of GPU devices from compute node by ""lspci"" and grep nvidia related keyword. 2.partition the default GPU instances for every A serial cards. 3.find the MIG resources by filter the VFs of GPU 4.report available VFs to cyborg-conductor and placement Change MIG partition by cyborg-api like change vgpu_type. Cyborg-api will call cyborg-agent to partition GPU and exec the period task to report new MIG info. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- No need to configure the vpgu_type for A serial GPU cards. Add new driver named nvidia_mig_driver for enabled_drivers. Developer impact ---------------- If the user want to use these feature, they should upgrade their Cyborg project to latest to support these changes. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: songwenping Work Items ---------- * Add new driver to manage MIG resources. * Change MIG partition by cyborg-api. * Change cyborgclient to support change MIG partition action. * Add related tests. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= Appropriate unit and functional tests should be added. Documentation Impact ==================== * Need a documentaiton to explain nvidia_mig_driver usage. References ========== ..

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =================================== Use extend volume completion action =================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/assisted-volume-extend This blueprint proposes to use the ``os-extend_volume_completion`` volume action that has been proposed for Cinder in [3]_, to provide feedback on success or failure when handling ``volume-extended`` external server events. Problem description =================== Many remotefs-based volume drivers in Cinder use the ``qemu-img resize`` command to extend volume files. However, when the volume is attached to a guest, QEMU will lock the file and ``qemu-img`` will be unable to resize it. In this case, only the QEMU process holding the lock can resize the volume, which can be triggered through the QEMU monitor command ``block-resize``. There is currently no adequate way for Cinder to use this feature, so the NFS, NetApp NFS, Powerstore NFS, and Quobyte volume drivers all disable extending attached volumes. Use Cases --------- As a user, I want to extend a NFS/NetApp NFS/Powerstore NFS/Quobyte volume while it is attached to an instance and I want the volume size and status to reflect the success or failure of the operation. Proposed change =============== Nova's libvirt driver uses the ``block-resize`` command when handling the ``volume-extended`` external server event, to inform QEMU that the size of an attached volume has changed. It is in principle also capable of extending a volume file, but is currently unable to provide feedback to Cinder on the success of the operation. Currently, Cinder will send the ``volume-extended`` external server event to Nova only after it has finalized the extend operation and reset the volume status from ``extending`` back to ``in-use``. With [3]_, Cinder will allow volume drivers to hold off finalizing the extend operation and leave the volume status as ``extending``, until after it has send the ``volume-extended`` event and received feedback from Nova in form of the ``os-extend_volume_completion`` volume action, with an ``error`` argument indicating whether to finalize or to roll back the operation. This will currently affect only the volume drivers mentioned above, all of which did not previously support online extend. All other drivers will continue to send the ``volume-extended`` event after finalizing the operation and resetting to ``in-use`` status, and will not expect a ``os-extend_volume_completion`` volume action. Compute Agent ------------- Nova's compute agent will use the volume status to differentiate between the two behaviors when handling ``volume-extended`` events: * If the volume status is ``extending``, then it will attempt to read ``extend_new_size`` from the volume's metadata and use this value as the new size of the volume, instead of the volume size field. After successfully extending the volume, it will call the extend volume completion action of the volume, with ``""error"": false``. If anything goes wrong, including ``extend_new_size`` being missing from the metadata, or being smaller than the current size of the volume, it will log the error and call the ``os-extend_volume_completion`` action with ``""error"": true``, so Cinder can roll back the operation. * For any other volume status, including ``in-use``, the event will be handled as before. API --- Nova's API will introduce a new microversion, so that Cinder can make sure the new behavior is available, before leaving an extend operation unfinished. To handle older compute agents during a rolling upgrade, the API will also check the compute service version of the target agent when receiving a ``volume-extended`` event with the new microversion. If a target compute agent is too old to support the feature, the API will discard the event and call the ``os-extend_volume_completion`` action with ``""error"": true``. Alternatives ------------ * A previous change tried to use the ``volume-extended`` external server event to support online extend for the NFS driver [1]_, but did not rely on feedback from Nova to Cinder at all. Instead, it would just set the new size of the volume, change the status back to ``in-use``, notify Nova, and hope for the best. If anything went wrong on Nova's side, this would still result in a volume state indicating that the operation was successful, which is not acceptable. * A previous version of this spec proposed a new synchronous API in Nova [2]_, that would directly call ``CompVirtAPI.extend_image`` of the nova-compute instance managing the guest that a volume was attached to. This API would provide a single mechanism to trigger the resize operation, communicate the new size to Nova, and get feedback on the success of the operation. The problem with a synchronous API is, that RPC and API timeouts limit the maximum time an extend operation can take. For QEMU, this seemed to be acceptable, because storage preallocation is hard disabled for the ``block-resize`` command, and because all currently plausible file systems support sparse file operations. However, this may not be true for other volume or virt drivers that might require this API in the future. It would also break with the established pattern of asynchronous coordination between Nova and Cinder, which includes the assisted snapshot and volume migration features. * Following this pattern, we could make the proposed API asynchronous and use a new callback in Cinder, similar to Nova's ``os-assisted-volume-snapshots`` API, which uses the ``os-update_snapshot_status`` snapshot action to provide feedback to Cinder. The function of the new Nova API would then just be to trigger the operation and to communicate the new size. The question is then, whether that warrants adding a new API to Nova, since there are existing mechanisms that could be used for either. * The existing mechanism for triggering the extend operation in Nova is of course the ``volume-extended`` external server event. Using it for this purpose, as this spec proposes, requires the target size to be transferred separately, because external server events only have a single text field that is freely usable, which for ``volume-extended`` is already used for the volume ID. Besides storing it in the admin metadata, as [3]_ and this spec propose, there is also the option of updating the size field of the volume, as [1]_ was essentially doing. This would require the volume size field to be reset on a failure. If an error response from Nova was lost, the volume would just keep the new size. We would need to extend ``os-reset_status`` to allow a size reset, or something similar to clean up volumes like this. This would be possible, but updating the size field only after the volume was successfully extended seems like a cleaner solution. * We could also extend the external server event API to accept additional data for events, and use this to communicate the new size to Nova. This option was judged favorably by reviewers on the previous version of this spec, [2]_, but it would be a more complex change to the Nova API. However, if additional data fields become available in a future version of the external server event API, it would be a relatively minor change to use this instead of volume metadata. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- The behavior of the external server event API will change. * If Nova receives a ``volume-extended`` event, and the referenced volume has status of ``extending``, Nova will look for the ``extend_new_size`` key in the volume metadata, and use this instead of the volume size field as the target size to update the block device mapping and to pass to the virt driver's ``extend_volume`` method. Nova will also attempt to call Cinder's new ``os-extend_volume_completion`` volume action proposed in [3]_ to let Cinder know if the operation was successful or not. * Otherwise, the API will behave as before. Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- Checking the target compute service version allows the API to handle rolling upgrades gracefully. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: kgube Other contributors: None Feature Liaison --------------- Feature liaison: None yet Work Items ---------- * Update the external server event API to check the target compute service version for ``volume-extended`` events. * Update the ``ComputeVirtAPI.extend_volume`` method to follow the behavior outlined in `Compute Agent`_. * Add unit tests. * Adapt NFS job in the Nova gate to validate online extend. Dependencies ============ * The extend volume completion action [3]_ Testing ======= We should test that the ``os-extend_volume_completion`` gets called correctly in all possible error or success condition if a volume has ``extending`` status. We should test the case that the call to ``os-extend_volume_completion`` fails. We also need to test that ``volume-extended`` continues to be handled correctly for volumes not in ``extending`` status. Documentation Impact ==================== The new behavior of the ``volume-extended`` event should be added to the documentation of the external server event API. References ========== ..

Previously the two values were the same; this caused us
to always exceed the timeout limit ACK_REQUEUE_EVERY_SECONDS_MAX
which results in various code paths never being traversed
due to premature timeout exceptions.

Also apply min/max values to kombu_reconnect_delay so it doesn't
exceed ACK_REQUEUE_EVERY_SECONDS_MAX and break things again.

Supported stable branches in maintenance state
(stein, train, ussuri) use the Tempest and plugins master
version for their testing. To make sure master version (new
tests or any changes) is compatible with stable branch testing,
we need to add the stable branches job on the plugins master gate.
