Previously we used short living OVN database connection to create
neutron_pg_drop Port Group before workers were spawned. The
pre_fork_initialize actually happens after the api workers are spawned
anyways and it blocks spawning of other workers, such as maintenance,
rpc or periodic. If the OVN database was large it may take several
minutes to connect to the database at scale and this blocks spawning of
other workers. That means connecting to OVN in pre_fork is not a good
idea.

This patch replaces the mechanism by using ovsdb-client to send a
transaction without connecting to the database and downloading the whole
content. The command does following, everything is on the server side:

 1) With timeout 0 it waits for neutron_pg_drop Port Group. If the PG is
    present, the transaction finishes and nothing happens.

 2) If the PG is not present, it times out immediately and commits new
    entries that effectivelly creates neutron_pg_drop Port Group with
    implicit ACLs to block ingress and egress traffic.

allowing us to do this in a future change when we've unified the

We want 'ServerBase' to inherit from 'InstanceHelperMixin'. They both
have implementations of a ""wait until server is deleted"" function.  The
'ServerBase' implementation is called '_wait_for_deletion' and takes a
'server_id', while the 'InstanceHelperMixin' implementation is called
'_wait_until_deleted' and takes a full server JSON-y dict. A later
change, I0c56841d098d3e9d72db65be3143f3c893f0b6ba, will rework the
'ServersTestBase' version to bring it inline with 'InstanceHelperMixin'
version. However, 'ServerBase._delete_server' currently calls a
'_wait_for_deletion' function and passes it a 'server_id'. As such,
'_delete_server' itself is only passed a server_id. After the future
change, this 'server_id' will no longer be enough as '_delete_server'
will need to call the newly merged '_wait_until_deleted' that takes a
full server JSON-y dict, so '_delete_server' itself needs to receive a
full server JSON-y dict.

Do this work now to simplify the future patch.

None of our functional live migration tests uses neutron ports. Simply
adding a port to the boot request shows that the live migration step of
the tests fails because the compute manager's
_do_pre_live_migration_from_source() call wait for vif-plugged events
from Neutron but our Neutron fixture does not send it.

This does not cause problem during a simple boot because during boot the
virt driver triggers the waiting for the vif-plug event and in the
functional test we have a FakeDriver that does not do it.

This patch implements the simplest solution to make it possible to test
live migration with neutron ports. It simply turns off the waiting by
setting CONF.vif_plugging_timeout to 0

A nicer solution would be to extend either the Neutron fixture or the
fake virt driver to send vif-plug event at certain triggers. But that
would require a lot more surgery.

This patch is a prerequisite to later patches covering live migration
with qos neutron ports.

Use an OVSDB lock to ensure that only one worker tries to create
the neutron_pg_drop port group. This also waits pre_fork so that if
getting the port group fails, neutron exits instead of continuing
on without the port group being created.

It was previously possible that a server could create the port
group and we wouldn't get the update before trying to create it
ourselves and checking for its existence.

This also modifies the get_port_group method to use the built-in
lookup() which searches by name or uuid and can take advantage of
both indexing and newly added ovsdbapp wait for sync functionality.

While the reverse order may work, it's considered invalid by OVN and not
guaranteed to work properly since OVN may not necessarily know which of
two ports is the one to configure.

This configuration also triggered a bug in OVN where tearing down a port
after deploying a new one resulted in removing flows that serve the
port.

There is a patch up for review for OVN [1] to better handle multiple
assignment of the same port, but it doesn't make the setup any more
valid.

This is first attempt to test whole upgrade procedure from
Train to Wallaby. We for now deal just with the OpenStack
upgrade part without OS upgrade step. When we will understand
the process better we will refactor this code.

Changes:
- Remove tls templates comversion.
- Cleanup adjust-roles-data. We might introduce new ones.
- Handle the network switch to ansible templates
- For now use Fast Furious procedure to generate playbook
- Add ceph adoption workflow from ceph-ansible to cephadm

Charms for OpenStack Yoga supports both Ubuntu Focal and Jammy
which means Python 3.8 and Python 3.10.  Managing dependencies
across those two versions is non-trivial and we need to build
the charm on the series the charm is supposed to support.

Switch to using a binary build which allows pip's dependency
resolution to work.

This patch also drops the impish bundle and unused overlay
bundles.

This change puts the specified key/value config-flags into
the [DEFAULT] section of the config file rather than the [api]
section, as they were supposed to be in the [DEFAULT] section.

Additionally, this change switches to using the config-flags
support from charms.openstack.

Since Ansible was bumped to 2.14, we've observed the container image
build process gets stuck in the middle of ansible tasks to generate
Docker/Buildah files, because of a bug[1] with ansible-runner.

This removes --debug option from the build command to avoid -vvv option
in the ansible command, to workaround the above bug.

Same workaround is added for content-provider already[2], adding same
workaround for build-containers role.

Changes:
- Remove tls templates comversion.
- Cleanup adjust-roles-data. We might introduce new ones.
- Handle the network switch to ansible templates
- For now use Fast Furious procedure to generate playbook
- Add ceph adoption workflow from ceph-ansible to cephadm

This change provides fixes that were dectected by unit
test failures with new jsonschema (and py310).

The types argument has been removed in favor of providing a
type_checker to jsonschema.validators.extend:
https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/issues/577

This change also refactors additional type checks after the
documentation here to get past many of the remaining failures:
https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validate/#validating-with-additional-types

It also fixes the format used for a few hostname format tests
to idn-hostname and this adds idna as test requirements,
which seems to be included anyway through other dependencies.

This is first attempt to test whole upgrade procedure from
Train to Wallaby. We for now deal just with the OpenStack
upgrade part without OS upgrade step. When we will understand
the process better we will refactor this code.

Changes:
- Remove tls templates comversion.
- Cleanup adjust-roles-data. We might introduce new ones.
- Handle the network switch to ansible templates
- For now use Fast Furious procedure to generate playbook
- Add ceph adoption workflow from ceph-ansible to cephadm

At the moment, we are actually going ahead and sending
an API request for every single member when doing a batch
update, this can be very expensive in large number of
members and will cause a big hit against the Neutron API,
it potentially also makes those API calls timeout.

This patch instead implements a simple cache (per batch
call) to simply store the subnets which are considered valid
which means that it will make significantly less calls,
potentially even one.

It also adjusts the behaviour so that it only runs this on newly
added members which should avoid running it for deleted and
updated members which won't have an effect in this change.

While migrating from cinderclient to OpenStack client, there is
expected to be a smooth transition and that means we want to try
to keep the syntax as similar as possible.
One such case where this isn't satisfied is the name and size
arguments in the volume create command.
The name argument is positional (although it was made optional) and
size is an optional argument (although it is mandatory when not
creating volume from another resource), this is a gap that could
cause the following behavior for end users:

When we are creating a volume from snapshot (or source volume or
backup), we execute the following command in cinderclient:

cinder create --snapshot <snapshot-uuid> <size>

This will create a volume from snapshot with the given size.

Eg: cinder create --snapshot <some-snapshot-uuid> 2
will create a volume of size 2 from given snapshot.

If we execute the same command in OSC,

openstack volume create --snapshot <some-snapshot-uuid> 2
This will create a volume of size same as snapshot but with name as 2.

This is because the syntax in OSC is following:
openstack volume create --snapshot <snapshot-uuid> <name>
and we need to specify --size to provide the size for the resource.
This example is executed in [1] for reference.

This patch modifies the behavior to make size as positional argument
and name as optional (--name).

Continue similar approach following in [1], where some project imports
collide with config options.

As part of the change, a wrapped decorator has been implemented to cover
those functions that include any of the ovn config options as value to
the decorators arguments (e.g. tenacity retry). This way we avoid
requiring the options to be registered as soon as the module is imported,

POST l7rule API call and PUT pool API call had a bug that might have

The code didn't use the right locked DB session to set the statuses and
then to rollback them when an exception was caught.

Ephemeral heat is shut off just after a Heat stack is created and
playbooks are generated. Thus we don't need to shut it off again.

Exporting stack no longer launches the ephemeral heat service since
commit d7af2f54826b3086af4691753b00173dc7a95a70 was merged.

To prepare for the new quota system we start deprecating configuration
options that will no longer be relevant in the new system:

- ``use_default_quota_class``
- ``max_age``
- ``until_refresh``
- ``reservation_clean_interval``
- ``reservation_expire``

The patch also adds a check on the ``quota_driver`` configuration option
if the deployment is using an external quota system.

The table ""router_extra_attributes"" is a child of ""router"" table.
Each register contains extra information that completes the router
description. When using ML2/OVS mechanism driver, the methods that
create and populate the ""router_extra_attributes"" register are always
called from the L3 DVR, L3 HA and availability zones extensions.

When using ML2/OVN, those extensions are not loaded and therefore the
""router_extra_attributes"" register is not created.

Despite this register is currently not used in ML2/OVN (it will be in
future features), there are some project expecting the
""router_extra_attributes"" register to be always created (for example,
neutron-dynamic-routing [1]).

This patch enforces the child register creating always when a router is
created. This register is populated with the default values. This new
register does not affect any current operation related to ML2/OVN nor
ML2/OVS.

There is a 1:1 relationship between ""routers"" and
""router_extra_attributes"". The child register is deleted by the database
engine when the ""routers"" register is deleted (ondelete=""CASCADE"").

Continue similar approach following in [1], where some project imports
collide with config options.

As part of the change, a wrapped decorator has been implemented to cover
those functions that include any of the ovn config options as value to
the decorators arguments (e.g. tenacity retry). This way we avoid
requiring the options to be registered as soon as the module is imported,
where they have not yet been registered by a main process.

Previously we used short living OVN database connection to create
neutron_pg_drop Port Group before workers were spawned. The
pre_fork_initialize actually happens after the api workers are spawned
anyways and it blocks spawning of other workers, such as maintenance,
rpc or periodic. If the OVN database was large it may take several
minutes to connect to the database at scale and this blocks spawning of
other workers. That means connecting to OVN in pre_fork is not a good
idea.

This patch replaces the mechanism by using ovsdb-client to send a
transaction without connecting to the database and downloading the whole
content. The command does following, everything is on the server side:

 1) With timeout 0 it waits for neutron_pg_drop Port Group. If the PG is
    present, the transaction finishes and nothing happens.

 2) If the PG is not present, it times out immediately and commits new
    entries that effectivelly creates neutron_pg_drop Port Group with
    implicit ACLs to block ingress and egress traffic.

Continue similar approach following in [1], where some project imports
collide with config options.

As part of the change, a wrapped decorator has been implemented to cover
those functions that include any of the ovn config options as value to
the decorators arguments (e.g. tenacity retry). This way we avoid
requiring the options to be registered as soon as the module is imported,
where they have not yet been registered by a main process.

the current context with it. This is used by many ml2 drivers, as it is
the only way for them to get the current context. We now make this a

automatically once devstack base job start running on Jammy(Depends-On).

While the reverse order may work, it's considered invalid by OVN and not
guaranteed to work properly since OVN may not necessarily know which of
two ports is the one to configure.

This configuration also triggered a bug in OVN where tearing down a port
after deploying a new one resulted in removing flows that serve the
port.

There is a patch up for review for OVN [1] to better handle multiple
assignment of the same port, but it doesn't make the setup any more
valid.

When simultaneous attempts are made to add an interface
to the same router including overlapping networks in cidrs,
both attempts are successful. There is a check to avoid this
overlap but is performed when creating the network interface
and it is done over the ports already attached to the router,
so at this moment the check is not able to detect the
overlapping. Furthermore, the create_port operation over the
ML2 plugin  must be executed in isolated transactions, so
trying to control the execution context or adding additional
steps to the transaction is not feasible.

This patch checks once the RouterPort is created on the
neutron database if there is more than one overlapping port,
triggering in that case the exception that will remove the
the culprit of overlapping.

Note: Added clean of l3_obj.RouterPort to avoid errors on
setUp of test class L3TestCase, pick from [1]. Also added
cfg allow_overlapping_ips to True for fullstack job, this one
had been deprecated and enabled by default in newer releases
but added in order to run the backported tests over this
stable branch.

The plugin ""qos"" is added to the ""EXT_PARENT_RESOURCE_MAPPING"" constant.
The policy engine can now check the QoS rule ownership using the QoS
policy project ID. The QoS rules are resources that do not have an
assigned project ID, it is inherited from the QoS policy. This patch
allows to check a QoS rule ownership using the ""ext_parent_policy_id""

When simultaneous attempts are made to add an interface
to the same router including overlapping networks in cidrs,
both attempts are successful. There is a check to avoid this
overlap but is performed when creating the network interface
and it is done over the ports already attached to the router,
so at this moment the check is not able to detect the
overlapping. Furthermore, the create_port operation over the
ML2 plugin  must be executed in isolated transactions, so
trying to control the execution context or adding additional
steps to the transaction is not feasible.

This patch checks once the RouterPort is created on the
neutron database if there is more than one overlapping port,
triggering in that case the exception that will remove the
the culprit of overlapping.

The playbook cli-overcloud-node-kernelargs.yaml calls the tuned role
and then the tripleo_kernel role.

The tuned role executes the following command:
    tuned-adm profile throughput-performance

This has the side-effect of adding $tuned_params to the options line
of /boot/loader/entries files, which is required to add its kernel
arguments from /boot/grub2/grubenv.

However when grub2-mkconfig is called, $tuned_params is *removed* from
the /boot/loader/entries files, breaking the enablement of the tuned
profile.

This change runs tuned-adm after grub2-mkconfig, which adds back
$tuned_params if there is an active profile.

While the reverse order may work, it's considered invalid by OVN and not
guaranteed to work properly since OVN may not necessarily know which of
two ports is the one to configure.

This configuration also triggered a bug in OVN where tearing down a port
after deploying a new one resulted in removing flows that serve the
port.

There is a patch up for review for OVN [1] to better handle multiple
assignment of the same port, but it doesn't make the setup any more
valid.

Tokens can have a expires_at field (specifically, we're seeing this issue
with Satellite). The token does not an expires_in. This patch allows for
the lookup lookup of either key from the token to resolve
cached token authentication issues.

Example token:
```
{'token': '$2a$09$1b6453892473a467d0737uJ56J02CLEXEkOaX0pdLWgLMlg.qWDSi',

 'issued_at': '2022-10-17T23:45:09.306Z'}
```

It's unnecessary to get the local time, since tokens have Zulu time. So just
datetime.now() is sufficient. But to perform the comparison, we need to convert
the string datetime from the return value into a valid datetime object.

This change corrects the describe behavior.

This patch is also marking all check and gate jobs as non-voting
until they are fixed.

Job ""networking-midonet-ml2-tempest-aio-centos8"" is deleted because
nodeset ""devstack-single-node-centos-8"" does not exist. Some templates
(check-requirements, publish-openstack-docs-pti and
release-notes-jobs-python3) are removed too.

Tests periodically fail right now because the cleanup which is
running in a different thread sometimes removes the managed objects
before we have completed testing with them.  The change to use

Also, when things are not cleaned up, you can get false positive

The plugin ""qos"" is added to the ""EXT_PARENT_RESOURCE_MAPPING"" constant.
The policy engine can now check the QoS rule ownership using the QoS
policy project ID. The QoS rules are resources that do not have an
assigned project ID, it is inherited from the QoS policy. This patch
allows to check a QoS rule ownership using the ""ext_parent_policy_id""

When simultaneous attempts are made to add an interface
to the same router including overlapping networks in cidrs,
both attempts are successful. There is a check to avoid this
overlap but is performed when creating the network interface
and it is done over the ports already attached to the router,
so at this moment the check is not able to detect the
overlapping. Furthermore, the create_port operation over the
ML2 plugin  must be executed in isolated transactions, so
trying to control the execution context or adding additional
steps to the transaction is not feasible.

This patch checks once the RouterPort is created on the
neutron database if there is more than one overlapping port,
triggering in that case the exception that will remove the
the culprit of overlapping.

Change I1a6ba311ddedc1b8910051257299d3acd367df46 made this
unconditionally specify ""networks: auto"" when no network info was
specified.  From the nova release notes

 ""Starting with microversion 2.37, this field is required and the
 special string values auto and none can be specified for
 networks. auto tells the Compute service to use a network that is
 available to the project, if one exists.""

So we should restrict where this is specified.

This was noticed when trying to use openstacksdk >=0.99 against the
Rackspace API.  I have run this change against that API and verified
it is not passing the argument.

The table ""router_extra_attributes"" is a child of ""router"" table.
Each register contains extra information that completes the router
description. When using ML2/OVS mechanism driver, the methods that
create and populate the ""router_extra_attributes"" register are always
called from the L3 DVR, L3 HA and availability zones extensions.

When using ML2/OVN, those extensions are not loaded and therefore the
""router_extra_attributes"" register is not created.

Despite this register is currently not used in ML2/OVN (it will be in
future features), there are some project expecting the
""router_extra_attributes"" register to be always created (for example,
neutron-dynamic-routing [1]).

This patch enforces the child register creating always when a router is
created. This register is populated with the default values. This new
register does not affect any current operation related to ML2/OVN nor
ML2/OVS.

There is a 1:1 relationship between ""routers"" and
""router_extra_attributes"". The child register is deleted by the database
engine when the ""routers"" register is deleted (ondelete=""CASCADE"").

There was a configuration leak in the agent based bind 9 tests, where if

This patch adds a configuration fixture setting override for the two

this is a very work in progress.

the nmstate depends on nispor that is not pip installable so I'm
adding a git install but that needs changed.

I removed the ipv4 and ipv6 from the ovsbridge because there's a comment on

https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/os-net-config/+/786323/2/os_net_config/impl_nmstate.py#325

When simultaneous attempts are made to add an interface
to the same router including overlapping networks in cidrs,
both attempts are successful. There is a check to avoid this
overlap but is performed when creating the network interface
and it is done over the ports already attached to the router,
so at this moment the check is not able to detect the
overlapping. Furthermore, the create_port operation over the
ML2 plugin  must be executed in isolated transactions, so
trying to control the execution context or adding additional
steps to the transaction is not feasible.

This patch checks once the RouterPort is created on the
neutron database if there is more than one overlapping port,
triggering in that case the exception that will remove the
the culprit of overlapping.

Note: Added clean of l3_obj.RouterPort to avoid errors on
setUp of test class L3TestCase, pick from [1]. Also added
cfg allow_overlapping_ips to True for fullstack job, this one
had been deprecated and enabled by default in newer releases
but added in order to run the backported tests over this
stable branch.

While the reverse order may work, it's considered invalid by OVN and not
guaranteed to work properly since OVN may not necessarily know which of
two ports is the one to configure.

This configuration also triggered a bug in OVN where tearing down a port
after deploying a new one resulted in removing flows that serve the
port.

There is a patch up for review for OVN [1] to better handle multiple
assignment of the same port, but it doesn't make the setup any more
valid.

While the reverse order may work, it's considered invalid by OVN and not
guaranteed to work properly since OVN may not necessarily know which of
two ports is the one to configure.

This configuration also triggered a bug in OVN where tearing down a port
after deploying a new one resulted in removing flows that serve the
port.

There is a patch up for review for OVN [1] to better handle multiple
assignment of the same port, but it doesn't make the setup any more
valid.

While the reverse order may work, it's considered invalid by OVN and not
guaranteed to work properly since OVN may not necessarily know which of
two ports is the one to configure.

This configuration also triggered a bug in OVN where tearing down a port
after deploying a new one resulted in removing flows that serve the
port.

There is a patch up for review for OVN [1] to better handle multiple
assignment of the same port, but it doesn't make the setup any more
valid.

tripleo-ansible-inventory was deprecated in
Ie02259336c763cfa980b59ad64f9e478d05690fb leaving no method to merge
""multistack"" inventories.

This patch restructures the inventory to allow merging via ansible
e.g by passing multiple inventory files or an inventory dir

The <plan_name> group is now a child of the ""allovercloud"" group (was
vice-versa) allowing the allovercloud group to be merged from multiple
inventory files.

The ""overcloud"" group is no longer a special case and will only exist if
that is the plan name.

generate_tripleo_ansible_inventory now generates a merged inventory to
avoid conflicts in <role_name> group vars.

While we do rotate the ansible.log file, it's never cleaned. This can
lead to some issues, depending on the amount of day-2 operations
(scaling, update, etc) - increasing size without control is usually a
bad thing.

Notes:
- we're using `find' instead of tmpwatch, because we want to target
  precise file pattern to remove. tmpwatch does the exact contrary.
- we're pushing the `find' in the existing container log cleaning, so
  that we don't have to edit newer releases to remove any new script we
  may want to add
- mistral being removed in newer releases (stable/wallaby), we can
  safely make this ""train-only"", and let newer releases override that
  script so that we don't have dangling things

Hopefully get out of the hell of proxy/no_proxy settings for

Since operators continue to (ab)use the http_proxy, https_proxy and,
especially, the no_proxy environment variables, and since this has been
creating many, many, many issues within container healthchecks, and,
finally, since proxy settings are mostly useless for that specific

Octavia API allows to create fully populated load balancers with
a single call, and the pools included in that call could include
HM. OVN-octavia-provider was not implementing this option and only
the loadbalancer/listener(s)/pool(s)/member(s) were created,
keeping the HM at the Octavia API as PENDING_CREATE.

This also generated leftovers when trying to delete the loadbalancer

os-vif currently set the requested mtu as part of separate request
to the port add command. As a result the port is initially created
with mbufer pool for the jumboframe size, which results in an
error in openvswitch-vswitch logs.

This change moves the mtu update request into ovsdb transaction.

This merge request focuses on fixing the VNC config for OpenStack Yoga
on the Focal and Jammy series. Originally, the Yoga version of this
charm was using a template nova.conf file from Train which did not use
the new [vnc] required for Yoga. Train had the VNC config in the
[DEFAULT] section, which is depreciated in Yoga.

Itemized changes to charm below:

 * Create templates/yoga
 * Move VNC config to [vnc] section in nova.conf
 * Rename VNC config keys to follow the Yoga specification.

Octavia API allows to create fully populated load balancers with
a single call, and the pools included in that call could include
HM. OVN-octavia-provider was not implementing this option and only
the loadbalancer/listener(s)/pool(s)/member(s) were created,
keeping the HM at the Octavia API as PENDING_CREATE.

This also generated leftovers when trying to delete the loadbalancer
with the --cascade option.

Currently when using SNMPv3, iRMC driver does not use SNMPv3
authentication parameters so the SNMPv3 authentication will
always fail. And iRMC cannot recognize FIPS mode, so when FIPS mode
is enabled, iRMC driver could still use non-FIPS-compliant algorithms.

This commit changes iRMC driver to require and use SNMPv3
authentication parameters when 'irmc_snmp_version' is set to v3 and
also makes iRMC driver to force 'irmc_snmp_version' to v3,
'irmc_snmp_auth_proto' to SHA and 'irmc_snmp_priv_proto' to AES
when FIPS mode is enabled, because currently among the algorithms
supported by iRMC, only SHA and AES are FIPS compliant.

Currently when using SNMPv3, iRMC driver does not use SNMPv3
authentication parameters so the SNMPv3 authentication will
always fail. And iRMC cannot recognize FIPS mode, so when FIPS mode
is enabled, iRMC driver could still use non-FIPS-compliant algorithms.

This commit changes iRMC driver to require and use SNMPv3
authentication parameters when 'irmc_snmp_version' is set to v3 and
also makes iRMC driver to force 'irmc_snmp_version' to v3,
'irmc_snmp_auth_proto' to SHA and 'irmc_snmp_priv_proto' to AES
when FIPS mode is enabled, because currently among the algorithms
supported by iRMC, only SHA and AES are FIPS compliant.

Libvirt needs to be able to plug ports into openvswitch bridges.
It does this using the ovs-vsctl command, which it searches for
in $PATH[1, 2]. This change will optionally install a wrapper
script that executes the ovs-vsctl commands in the context of the

This patch creates special podman socket for sensubility purposes
on /var/lib instead of /run as it is tmpfs and so permission changes
would perish after reboot.

This patch also removes rsyslog configuration for separate HC log file.
This is not needed anymore since sensubility fetches data straight from podman
instead of parsing the log file.

Sensubility is also set to connect to QDR in scenario001-standalone job
so that it is visible in the logs that HC script succeeds.

tripleo-ansible-inventory was deprecated in
Ie02259336c763cfa980b59ad64f9e478d05690fb leaving no method to merge
""multistack"" inventories.

This patch restructures the inventory to allow merging via ansible
e.g by passing multiple inventory files or an inventory dir

The <plan_name> group is now a child of the ""allovercloud"" group (was
vice-versa) allowing the allovercloud group to be merged from multiple
inventory files.

The ""overcloud"" group is no longer a special case and will only exist if
that is the plan name.

generate_tripleo_ansible_inventory now generates a merged inventory to
avoid conflicts in <role_name> group vars.

os-vif currently set the requested mtu as part of separate request
to the port add command. As a result the port is initially created
with mbufer pool for the jumboframe size, which results in an
error in openvswitch-vswitch logs.

This change moves the mtu update request into ovsdb transaction.

Because of how much this work can vary over a six month release cycle, we've chosen to no longer dictate timelines for specific work items. Instead, we will document work items we would like to see completed, and then allow the community to pick up and work on them as time permits. We strongly encourage all corporate and individual contributors to dedicate resources to help maintain the commons; including CI and stable branches. The more contributors we have helping keep the commons healthy, the more time we have to work on new items. This document is only going updated as items are complete. For information or current status of items in progress, please see the Ironic Whiteboard at https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/IronicWhiteBoard.

Goals Details ============= SQLAlchemy 2.0 Compatability ---------------------------- Our DB layer is currently using SQLAlchemy 1.4 or older, and relies heavily on autocommit behaviors. Additionally as part of the migration to 2.0, SQLAlchemy now requires developers be more explicit about querying than in previous versions. There is a significant amount of work to be done as part of this migration, but the resulting DB layer in the code should be clearer as a result. Cleaning up RAID created by tenants ----------------------------------- TODO: Write this Remove default use of MD5 ------------------------- The MD5 hashing algorithm is still supported in Glance and Ironic for image hashing. This is not ideal as MD5 is broken. This work will be a breaking change; forbidding use of MD5 hashes by default. Operators who wish to continue using MD5 for API compatability reasons will be able to re-enable it via config. Merging Inspector into Ironic ----------------------------- Ironic Inspector was originally created as a service external to Ironic. Now, it's used by a large number of Ironic operators around the world and should be integrated with the primary service. Now is a good time to do this work as well, as Ironic Inspector also needs to be updated to work with SQLAlchemy 2.0. Active Steps ------------ Ironic uses steps to perform actions on a node during deployment or cleaning. We'd like to extend this concept of steps to allow for maintainence on actively deployed nodes. This new Active Steps feature will allow operators to perform a firmware update -- or any other automated action on a provisioned, ACTIVE node. Conductor Scaling & Locking --------------------------- Traditionally, Ironic has taken an aggressive approach to locking nodes while work is being performed at the expense of operations failing when a conductor is shutdown or unavailable. This change will allow operators to gracefully shutdown a conductor from the cluster, ensuring that no in-progress actions will fail. As part of implementing and improving this, we will also need to narrow the situations in which Ironic will lock a node and improve our methods of locking. ",,160,0

Recent changes to the httpd config template[0] have led to

Substitution of the 'localhost' for '*' should resolve the issue.

Same modification was applied to the ""Ensure port is open"" task

os-vif currently set the requested mtu as part of separate request
to the port add command. As a result the port is initially created
with mbufer pool for the jumboframe size, which results in an

This change moves the mtu update request into ovsdb transaction.

Since Ansible was bumped to 2.14, we've observed the container image
build process gets stuck in the middle of ansible tasks to generate
Docker/Buildah files, because of a bug[1] with ansible-runner.

This removes --debug option from the build command to avoid -vvv option
in the ansible command, to workaround the above bug.

The glance-api service requires that access to NFS backend is ready
before the service is started. This adds systemd service dependency to

Currently snapshot delete requires access to the source volume and
the operation fails if the source volume doesn't exist in the backend.
This prevents some snapshots from being deleted when the source volume
image is deleted from the backend for some reason (for example, after
cluster format).

This change makes the rbd driver to skip updating the source volume
if it doesn't exist. A warning log is left so that operators can be
aware of any skip event.

This commit also includes a squash to add a releasenote from
I40f6eb1f104da4410d32410940824a88f7d1ec62 to reduce backporting
workload.

While the reverse order may work, it's considered invalid by OVN and not
guaranteed to work properly since OVN may not necessarily know which of
two ports is the one to configure.

This configuration also triggered a bug in OVN where tearing down a port
after deploying a new one resulted in removing flows that serve the
port.

There is a patch up for review for OVN [1] to better handle multiple
assignment of the same port, but it doesn't make the setup any more
valid.

Guidance is provided in the :doc:`../../concepts/software-sources` page. * With channel charms, you will need to change the charm's channel.

","Update the charm channel ------------------------ .. warning:: This step is only performed for channel charms - see the :doc:`../../concepts/charm-types` page. A charm's channel needs to be updated according to the target OpenStack release and the Ubuntu series currently in use.

The change is made as per the following syntax: .. code-block:: none juju refresh --channel=<channel> <application> For example, if the cloud is being upgraded to OpenStack Yoga then the keystone charm's channel should be updated to 'yoga/stable': .. code-block:: none juju refresh --channel=yoga/stable keystone Charms whose services are not technically part of the OpenStack project will generally use a channel naming scheme that is not based on OpenStack release names.

OpenStack tox base jobs are migrated to ubuntu jammy for
2023.1 onwards and they will continue running on Focal
until stable/zed.

Our tests don't do the eventlet monkey patching in the same way that the
Cinder services -backup, scheduler, volume- do.

This patch changes this by doing the monkey patching as soon as
possible, before cinder OVOs are loaded and bring in a number of oslo
libraries.

When copying the initialization part from the Cinder commands a fix for
'current_thread' is also copied.

iSCSI and NVMEoF targets.
This patch updates the help text to reflect the same.

When a CLI user specifies --os-volume api-version 3.66, the shell
will execute the appropriate shell code, but if the server only
supports < 3.66, the client is automatically downgraded and correctly
uses the pre-3.66 SnapshotManager.create() method.

In that case, the 'force' parameter, which is technically not allowed
in mv 3.66 (but which silently accepts a True value for backward
compatibility), will have a value of None, which the pre-3.66 code
happily passes to cinder as '""force"": null' in the request body, and
which then fails the Block Storage API request-schema check.

Handle this situation by detecting a None 'force' value and setting
it to its pre-3.66 default value of False.

We had an issue in os-brick that caused a failure in cinder gate.
The wallaby patch for the fix is merged[1] but wallaby has
transitioned into EM and we can't release os-brick wallaby anymore.

To fix the cinder gate situation (as seen here[2]), this patch adds
os-brick as a required project for the ceph job (which is failing)
so we will fetch os-brick from source and not the released version
hence fixing the gate situation.

Kolla Ansible is switching to OpenSearch and is dropping support for
deploying ElasticSearch. This is because the final OSS release of
ElasticSearch has exceeded its end of life.

Monasca is affected because it uses both Logstash and ElasticSearch.
Whilst it may continue to work with OpenSearch, Logstash remains an
issue.

In the absence of any renewed interest in the project, we remove
support for deploying it. This helps to reduce the complexity
of log processing configuration in Kolla Ansible, freeing up
development time.
