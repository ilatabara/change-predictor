As a database server, its primary function is to store data, securely and supporting best practices, and retrieve it later, as requested by other software applications, be it those on the same computer or those running on another computer across a network (including the Internet). It can handle workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users. Recent versions also provide replication of the database itself for security and scalability. PostgreSQL implements the majority of the SQL:2011 standard, is ACID-compliant and transactional (including most DDL statements) avoiding locking issues using multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), provides immunity to dirty reads and full serializability; handles complex SQL queries using many indexing methods that are not available in other databases; has updateable views and materialized views, triggers, foreign keys; supports functions and stored procedures, and other expandability, and has a large number of extensions written by third parties. In addition to the possibility of working with the major proprietary and open source databases, PostgreSQL supports migration from them, by its extensive standard SQL support and available migration tools. And if proprietary extensions had been used, by its extensibility that can emulate many through some built-in and third-party open source.

This makes us actually capable of sending migrate_data objects
over the wire and handles all the compatibility work to tolerate
older nodes without this support.

Note this also fixes a bug in the libvirt migration data
object where the serial console field should be nullable
(per existing code) but wasn't. Since this is the patch that
actually lets this object be sent over the wire, we can update
the definition and the hash without needing a version bump.

This patch uses the standard password generation functionality to
randomly set the NeutronMetadataProxySharedSecret parameter.

Without this parameter, Neutron has a blank value for it's shared
secret. This value is used to to prevent spoofing, thus the
default value of ""unset"" is bad. This exposes a potential attack

YaqlExpressionFilePosition objects being constructed by yaml loader
didn't contain package-related metadata as they were created by a single
loader object shared for all the loaded yaml files.

MuranoPL debugger will need to uniquely identify the files the MuranoPL
statements belong to, and the full filenames doe not fit here, as they
are the names of some temporary files, local to engine and not available
externally.
Instead, the file should be identified by the id and/or
fully-qualified-name of the package and the relative path to the file
within this package.

This patch adds apropriate logic to the yaml loader.

The follwing errors during installation from USB stick/image
caused by the attempt to mount partition that already used

  + mount /dev/disk/by-label/Mirantis_Fuel /tmp/source
  mount: /dev/sda1 is write-protected, mounting read-only
  mount: /dev/sda1 is already mounted or /tmp/source busy

Anaconda mounts paritions from 'repo' automatically (not sure
about nfs partitions but there is a code to mount is explicitely),
so it's not possible to re-mount it. However, we can mount it
with 'bind' option to make avaible in another path.

This commit collects all the logic to mount SOURCE path
in one place and adds additional checks to avoid mointing when
SOURCE path set up already.

Currently the only consumer of ansible find_disks module is Ceph. And
Ceph OSD deployment in kolla uses GPT partition label to detect and
identify disks for Ceph OSD use. This is not always true for all the

The change here extended the find_disks module by:
- adding `name` argument to find disk by either partition name or

- `partition_name` argument now becomes an alias to `name`
- adding `match_mode` argument to allow prefix matching. It is used for

When we associate a floatingip in an HA router setup, it is properly
associated. However, when we check the status of the Floating ip, it
is shown as empty.  The L3 agent ha_router implementation never sets
the status of the floating IP when it's added.  This behavior blocks

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== XenAPI: VDI store via streaming ========================================== Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/xenapi-image-streaming Introduce a new VDI store to upload and download image via a streaming way on the Compute node. Problem description =================== In the existing XenAPI image upload and download handler, the real downloading and uploading function is finished by the XAPI plugin working in Dom0. There are some problems: 1. Two much reliance on the XAPI plugin running on Dom0 2. XenSever Dom0 now only support python 2.4. So the plugin is wroten with python 2.4. There is no UT for it. 3. the way handling the VHD files is not formal supported. There is no adequate testing. 4. it only support EXT as the local SR's type. But XenServer's default local SR type is LVM. Use Cases ---------- With this solution, the XenServer cloud administrator can configure ''image_download_handler'' and ''image_upload_handler'' to pass data between glance and SR VDI via streaming way on the compute node when download or upload images. Proposed change =============== Create a new VdiStreamStore to handle image download and upload function via streaming on compute node. This new Store can be chosen via nova conf. 1. **Download_image**: 1). Download image stream from glance and pipe the gzipped tarball data stream 2). xtract VHD file from stream and pipe VHD file content 3). Invoke XAPI to create a VDI and use http(s) to import VHD file to VDI. ''http(s)://<host IP>/import_raw_vdi?<reuqired parameters>'' 2. **Upload_image**: 1). Use http(s) request to export VHD stream from SR VDI ''http(s)://<host IP>/export_raw_vdi?<reuqired parameters>'' 2). Create gzipped tarball from the stream on fly and pass the data stream to glance service to create the image. *Note: With this implement, it can't support multiple VHD files in the tarball. As it has to re-parent the vhd files to build the VDI chain if there are multiple VHD files. It has race condition with SR GC. e.g. SR GC will audit VHD files and may delete the imported VHDs before they are re-parenting properly. But we only use VdiStreamStore to upload images, it won't have multiple VHDs in a single tarball. Alternatives ------------ We can resolve the problems in the old implement via the following way. * **Download_image**: Download the compressed tar file temporarily on the local disk; Unpack the compressed tar file and then upload/import the VHD file to XenServer's SR. * **Upload_image**: Download/export the VHD file from XenServer's SR and save it temporarily on the local disk; create the compressed tar file and upload it to Glance service. But it wil introduce new problems: * It will occupy extra disk space on the compute node; it's not acceptable specially when the image is large. * It starts uploading after finishing the first downloading on local disk. It's less efficient by comparing to the proposed change. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- The change is transparent to REST API. Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- Performance Impact ------------------ Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: jianghuaw Other contributors: Work Items ---------- * Need create a new class ''VdiStreamStore'' and implement the functions of ''upload_image'' and ''download_image''. * Add new config option image_download_handler for image handler (image_upload_handler exists already) so that this new Store can be chosen to take effective. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= * Unit tests. * Citrix XenServer CI. Documentation Impact ==================== * Need add the new config option of ''image_download_handler'' and the new VDI store of ''VdiStreamStore'' in the nova configuration document.

Problem description =================== In the existing XenAPI image upload and download handler, the real downloading and uploading function is finished by the XAPI plugin working in Dom0. There are some problems: 1. Two much reliance on the XAPI plugin running on Dom0 2. XenSever Dom0 now only support python 2.4. So the plugin is wroten with python 2.4. There is no UT for it. 3. the way handling the VHD files is not formal supported. There is no adequate testing. 4. it only support EXT as the local SR's type. But XenServer's default local SR type is LVM. Use Cases ---------- With this solution, the XenServer cloud administrator can configure ''image_download_handler'' and ''image_upload_handler'' to pass data between glance and SR VDI via streaming way on the compute node when download or upload images. Proposed change =============== Create a new VdiStreamStore to handle image download and upload function via streaming on compute node. This new Store can be chosen via nova conf. 1. **Download_image**: 1). Download image stream from glance and pipe the gzipped tarball data stream 2). xtract VHD file from stream and pipe VHD file content 3). Invoke XAPI to create a VDI and use http(s) to import VHD file to VDI. ''http(s)://<host IP>/import_raw_vdi?<reuqired parameters>'' 2. **Upload_image**: 1). Use http(s) request to export VHD stream from SR VDI ''http(s)://<host IP>/export_raw_vdi?<reuqired parameters>'' 2). Create gzipped tarball from the stream on fly and pass the data stream to glance service to create the image. *Note: With this implement, it can't support multiple VHD files in the tarball. As it has to re-parent the vhd files to build the VDI chain if there are multiple VHD files. It has race condition with SR GC. e.g. SR GC will audit VHD files and may delete the imported VHDs before they are re-parenting properly. But we only use VdiStreamStore to upload images, it won't have multiple VHDs in a single tarball. Alternatives ------------ We can resolve the problems in the old implement via the following way. * **Download_image**: Download the compressed tar file temporarily on the local disk; Unpack the compressed tar file and then upload/import the VHD file to XenServer's SR. * **Upload_image**: Download/export the VHD file from XenServer's SR and save it temporarily on the local disk; create the compressed tar file and upload it to Glance service. But it wil introduce new problems: * It will occupy extra disk space on the compute node; it's not acceptable specially when the image is large. * It starts uploading after finishing the first downloading on local disk. It's less efficient by comparing to the proposed change. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- The change is transparent to REST API.

This change allows deployers to specify locally sourced apt keys
on the ansible host or URL rather than requiring all apt keys to
be downloaded from upstream keyservers.

The current implementation requires that all containers and hosts
we deploy to have an internet connection to download apt keys for
the various repos. This change allows the user to source apt keys
from the deployment host like for example:

ceph_gpg_keys:
  - key_name: 'ceph'
    data: ""{{ lookup('file', '/etc/openstack_deploy/keys/ceph.gpg') }}""
    hash_id: '0xe84ac2c0460f3994'

Note: Deployers can already set the repo URLs to use local sources,
so this enables fully offline package installation.

There are methods called on events like node create, node update, cluster delete etc. which can be used to inject some logic. The problem is that currently all extensions must be placed inside `extensions` module in Nailgun's source code. Also in order to make extension visible for Fuel, it must be imported and explicitly added to global `extensions` list. It means that there is no elegant way for User to use extensions capabilities. ---------------- Proposed changes ---------------- The extensions system must be refactored to meet the following conditions: * It must be pluggable - User is able to write an extension, place it in separate package and add it to available extensions list just by running :code:`pip install <extension-name>` * It must implement auto-discovery of extensions. * Extension has `description` field which briefly describes its features. * Extensions can be enabled from Fuel CLI for specific cluster or release and because of that we also need: * Additional API handlers to deal with extensions. More details in `REST API`_ section. The best solution here is to use stevedore - a manager for dynamic plugins in Python. Stevedore uses namespaces to load the extensions so the proposed namespace for nailgun extensions is `nailgun.extensions`. Web UI ====== Web UI must be prepared to consume new API handlers for enabling/disabling extensions for specific release/cluster. Nailgun ======= Data model ---------- None REST API -------- .. http:get:: /extensions/ Returns list of all available extensions **Response format:** .. sourcecode:: http [ { ""name"": ""extension1"", ""version"": ""1.0.0"", ""description"": ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"" }, { ""name"": ""extension2"", ""version"": ""2.1.0"", ""description"": ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"" }, ... ] :statuscode 200: Returns list of extensions or empty list .. http:get:: /clusters/(cluster_id)/extensions Returns list of all enabled extensions in cluster with id `cluster_id` **Response format:** .. sourcecode:: http [ ""extension1"", ""extension2"", ""extension3"", ... ] :statuscode 200: Returns list of extensions or empty list :statuscode 404: No such cluster .. http:put:: /clusters/(cluster_id)/extensions Enable/disable extensions **Example request**: .. sourcecode:: http [ ""extension1"", ""extension2"", ""extension3"", ... ] :statuscode 200: extensions has been enabled for release :statuscode 400: there is no such extension available :statuscode 404: No such cluster .. http:get:: /releases/(release_id)/extensions Returns list of all enabled extensions in release with id `release_id` **Response format:** .. sourcecode:: http [ ""extension1"", ""extension2"", ""extension3"", ... ] :statuscode 200: Returns list of extensions or empty list :statuscode 404: No such release .. http:put:: /releases/(release_id)/extensions Enable/disable extensions **Example request**: .. sourcecode:: http [ ""extension1"", ""extension2"", ""extension3"", ... ] :statuscode 200: extensions has been enabled for release :statuscode 400: there is no such extension available :statuscode 404: No such release Orchestration ============= RPC Protocol ------------ None Fuel Client =========== * End User is able to see the list and details of all available extensions: :code:`fuel extensions` * End User is able enable/disable extensions for specific cluster/release :code:`fuel --env 1 env set --extensions extension1 extension2 ...` :code:`fuel --rel 1 release set --extensions extension1 extension2 ...` Plugins ======= None Fuel Library ============ None ------------ Alternatives ------------ * We could write our own plugin system instead of using Stevedore. But: * In most cases it is not good to reinvent the wheel. It also applies for this one, since current extensions system doesn't need a lot of work to port it to Stevedore. * We could use some other plugin system like `baseplugin` [#baseplugin]_. But: * As an OpenStack project we should reuse other OpenStack projects * Stevedore is already in global requirements. -------------- Upgrade impact -------------- None --------------- Security impact --------------- None -------------------- Notifications impact -------------------- * Notification when extensions is enabled/disabled for cluster/release. --------------- End user impact --------------- User is able to extend Nailgun features by writing own extension which uses Nailgun's extensions base class and namespace which is `nailgun.extensions`. ------------------ Performance impact ------------------ None ----------------- Deployment impact ----------------- The change is nailgun specific, so there's no Deployment impact. ---------------- Developer impact ---------------- All new extensions should be placed in separate packages. The `extensions` module in nailgun should be not extended anymore. --------------------- Infrastructure impact --------------------- None -------------------- Documentation impact -------------------- Extensions mechanism should be described: * How to write extension: * Where is the base class for extension * What is the minimal working extension (required properties etc.) * What are the possibilities * Nailgun namespace which is `nailgun.extensions` * Example of simple extension with `logging` which logs appropriate message on every event like `on_node_create`, `on_node_update` etc. -------------- Implementation -------------- Assignee(s) =========== Primary assignee: Sylwester Brzeczkowski <sbrzeczkowski@mirantis.com> Other contributors: * Evgeny Li <eli@mirantis.com> Mandatory design review: * Evgeny Li <eli@mirantis.com> Work Items ========== * Setup Nailgun with Stevedore. Add possibility to install extensions in separate packages * Nailgun API changes for clusters and releases. * Possibility to change extensions to cluster/releases from WebUI * Possibility to change extensions to cluster/releases from Fuel CLI Dependencies ============ * Fuel integration with Bareon service [#bp_bareon_integration]_. * Stevedore module [#stevedore_docs]_. ------------ Testing, QA ------------ * Install extension from separate package and check if it's available in Nailgun * Check if after enabling/disabling extensions the notification appear.

Vertica comes with a User Defined Load function that takes a URL as a
load source. This can be used to load files that are stored in Swift. As
this is a common use case, it is valuable to enable this by default.

This can be done in the post-prepare method for Vertica. A new UDL_LIBS

When I create a replication volume with extra_specs
'replication_type=<is> xxx', creation failure is expected. But the
replication volume is created success.

Please pay attention on '<is>' and '<in>' key words. Volume backend
reports capabilities as replication_type=['sync', 'async'], so the
valid extra_specs should be 'replication_type=<in> sync' or
'replication_type=<in> async'. When I use '<is>' instead of '<in>',
the scheduler match the capabilities and choose an unexpected backend.

Cinder scheduler match values incorrectly when use '<is>' method in
capabilities_filter. Operator method '<is>' should be used to compare
between two boolean values. If values can't convert to boolean, it's
not a match capability.

In big and busy clusters there could be a condition when
rabbitmq clustering mechanism synchronizes queues and during
this period agents connected to that instance of rabbitmq
can't communicate with the server and server considers them
dead moving resources away. After agent become active again,
it needs to cleanup state entries and synchronize its state
with neutron-server.
The solution is to make agents aware of their state from
neutron-server point of view. This is done by changing state
reports from cast to call that would return agent's status.
When agent was dead and becomes alive, it would receive special
AGENT_REVIVED status indicating that it should refresh its
local data which it would not do otherwise.

OVS agent tunnel interfaces are named via:
'%s-%s' % (tunnel_type, destination_ip)

This means that the tunnel interface name is not unique if
two OVS agents on the same machine try to form a tunnel with a
third agent. This happens during full stack tests that start
multiple copies of the OVS agent on the test machine.

Thus, for full stack tests, to make sure that the tunnel
interface names created by ovs agents are globally unique, they
will have the following format :
'%s-%s-%s' % (tunnel_type, hash of source IP, hash of dest IP)

Since this patch centralizes the formation of the tunnel interface
name in a dedicated method that is monkey patched by the full stack
framework, a unit test has been added for this method.

The login page is a bit longer than it should be, and as such, it is
scrollable.  This is not immediately apparent in OSX, as you have to
actually scroll in the window for the scrollbars to become visible,
but it was apparent in non-OSX operating systems.

We add a top padding to the application to compensate for the navbar
height, however, we don't need to add that padding to the splash
page because it doesn't have a navbar.

Notifications in Nova ===================== Similarly to other OpenStack services Nova emits notifications to the message bus with the Notifier class provided by oslo.messaging [1]_. From the notification consumer point of view a notification consists of two parts an envelope with a fix structure defined by oslo.messaging and a payload defined by the service emitting the notification. The envelope format is the following:: { ""priority"": <string, selected from a predefined list by the sender>, ""event_type"": <string, defined by the sender>, ""timestamp"": <string, the isotime of when the notification emitted>, ""publisher_id"": <string, defined by the sender>, ""message_id"": <uuid, generated by oslo>, ""payload"": <json serialized dict, defined by the sender> } There are two types of notifications in Nova based on the payload format. Legacy notifications with unversioned payload and notifications with versioned payload. Unversioned notifications ------------------------- Nova code uses the nova.rpc.get_notifier call to get a configured oslo.messaging Notifier object and it uses the oslo provided functions on the Notifier object to emit notifications. The configuration of the returned Notifier object depends on the parameters of the get_notifier call and the value of the oslo.messaging configuration options `notification_driver` and `notification_topics`. There are notification configuration options in Nova which are specific for certain notification types like `notify_on_state_change`, `notify_api_faults`, `default_notification_level`, etc. The structure of the payload of the unversioned notifications is defined in the code that emits the notification and no documentation or enforced backward compatibility contract exists for that format. Versioned notifications ----------------------- Versioned notification concept is created to fix the shortcomings of the unversioned notifications. The envelope structure of the emitted notification is the same as in the unversioned notification case as it is provided by oslo.messaging. However the payload is not a free form dictionary but a serialized oslo versionedobject [2]_. .. _service.update: For example the wire format of the `service.update` notification looks like the following:: { ""priority"":""INFO"", ""payload"":{ ""nova_object.namespace"":""nova"", ""nova_object.name"":""ServiceStatusPayload"", ""nova_object.version"":""1.0"", ""nova_object.data"":{ ""host"":""host1"", ""disabled"":false, ""last_seen_up"":null, ""binary"":""nova-compute"", ""topic"":""compute"", ""disabled_reason"":null, ""report_count"":1, ""forced_down"":false, ""version"":2 } }, ""event_type"":""service.update"", ""publisher_id"":""nova-compute:host1"" } The serialized oslo versionedobject as a payload provides a version number to the consumer so the consumer can detect if the structure of the payload is changed. Nova provides the following contract regarding the versioned notification payload: * the payload version defined by the `the nova_object.version` field of the payload will be increased if and only if the syntax or the semantic of the `nova_object.data` field of the payload is changed. * a minor version bump indicates a backward compatible change which means that only new fields are added to the payload so a well written consumer can still consume the new payload without any change. * a major version bump indicates a backward incompatible change of the payload which can mean removed fields, type change, etc in the payload. How to add a new versioned notification ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ To support the above contract from the Nova code every versioned notification is modeled with oslo versionedobjects. Every versioned notification class shall inherit from the `nova.objects.notification.NotificationBase` which already defines three mandatory fields of the notification `event_type`, `publisher_id` and `priority`. The new notification class shall add a new field `payload` with an appropriate payload type. The payload object of the notifications shall inherit from the `nova.objects.notification.NotificationPayloadBase` class and shall define the fields of the payload as versionedobject fields. The base classes are described in [3]_. The following code example defines the necessary model classes for a new notification `myobject.update`:: @base.NovaObjectRegistry.register class MyObjectNotification(notification.NotificationBase): # Version 1.0: Initial version VERSION = '1.0' fields = { 'payload': fields.ObjectField('MyObjectUpdatePayload') } @base.NovaObjectRegistry.register class MyObjectUpdatePayload(notification.NotificationPayloadBase): # Version 1.0: Initial version VERSION = '1.0' fields = { 'some_data': fields.StringField(), 'another_data': fields.StringField(), } After that the notification can be populated and emitted with the following code:: payload = MyObjectUpdatePayload(some_data=""foo"", another_data=""bar"") MyObjectNotification.create( publisher=<nova.objects.service.Service instance that emits the notification>, event_type=notification.EventType( object='myobject', action=fields.NotificationAction.UPDATE), priority=fields.NotificationPriority.INFO, payload=payload).emit(context) The above code will generate the following notification on the wire:: { ""priority"":""INFO"", ""payload"":{ ""nova_object.namespace"":""nova"", ""nova_object.name"":""MyObjectUpdatePayload"", ""nova_object.version"":""1.0"", ""nova_object.data"":{ ""some_data"":""foo"", ""another_data"":""bar"", } }, ""event_type"":""myobject.update"", ""publisher_id"":""<the name of the service>:<the host where the service runs>"" } There is a possibility to reuse an existing versionedobjects as notification payload by adding a `SCHEMA` field for the payload class that defines a mapping between the fields of an existing object and the fields of the new payload object. For example the service.status notification reuses the existing `nova.objects.service.Service` object when defines the notification's payload:: @base.NovaObjectRegistry.register class ServiceStatusNotification(notification.NotificationBase): # Version 1.0: Initial version VERSION = '1.0' fields = { 'payload': fields.ObjectField('ServiceStatusPayload') } @base.NovaObjectRegistry.register class ServiceStatusPayload(notification.NotificationPayloadBase): SCHEMA = { 'host': ('service', 'host'), 'binary': ('service', 'binary'), 'topic': ('service', 'topic'), 'report_count': ('service', 'report_count'), 'disabled': ('service', 'disabled'), 'disabled_reason': ('service', 'disabled_reason'), 'availability_zone': ('service', 'availability_zone'), 'last_seen_up': ('service', 'last_seen_up'), 'forced_down': ('service', 'forced_down'), 'version': ('service', 'version') } # Version 1.0: Initial version VERSION = '1.0' fields = { 'host': fields.StringField(nullable=True), 'binary': fields.StringField(nullable=True), 'topic': fields.StringField(nullable=True), 'report_count': fields.IntegerField(), 'disabled': fields.BooleanField(), 'disabled_reason': fields.StringField(nullable=True), 'availability_zone': fields.StringField(nullable=True), 'last_seen_up': fields.DateTimeField(nullable=True), 'forced_down': fields.BooleanField(), 'version': fields.IntegerField(), } If the `SCHEMA` field is defined then the payload object needs to be populated with the `populate_schema` call before it can be emitted:: payload = ServiceStatusPayload() payload.populate_schema(service=<nova.object.service.Service object>) ServiceStatusNotification.create( publisher=<nova.object.service.Service object>, event_type=notification.EventType( object='service', action=fields.NotificationAction.UPDATE), priority=fields.NotificationPriority.INFO, payload=payload).emit(context) The above code will emit the :ref:`already shown notification<service.update>` on the wire. Every item in the `SCHEMA` has the syntax of <payload field name which needs to be filled>: (<name of the parameter of the populate_schema call>, <the name of a field of the parameter object>) The mapping defined in the `SCHEMA` field has the following semantics. When the `populate_schema` function is called the content of the `SCHEMA` field is enumerated and the value of the field of the pointed parameter object is copied to the requested payload field. So in the above example the `host` field of the payload object is populated from the value of the `host` field of the `service` object that is passed as a parameter to the `populate_schema` call. A notification payload object can reuse fields from multiple existing objects. Also a notification can have both new and reused fields in its payload. Versioned notifications shall have a sample file stored under `doc` directory similarly to api samples. For example the `service.update` notification has a sample file stored in `doc/api_samples/os-services/notification/service-update.json`. ..

APIs such as region creation allow an empty entity (a random UUID will
be generated as the region in this case).

Keystone uses JSONShema for validation and will allow an empty entity
to be passed if the schema doesn't have `required` properties (as the
region creation schema allows).

The patch fixes the schema validation code to pass even an empty entity
to JSONSchema validation so that an API such as region create can pass
the validation and can be created successfully.

Previously, the assertValidProjectScopedTokenResponse method only ensured
specific attributes were in the token response. These checks didn't ensure
that the token scope never grew.

This change makes it so that the assertion will fail if extra attributes are
added to the token response. This should help us be more aware of changes that
have token response data creep by building the check into the tests.

Follow new infra setup for translations, see spec
http://specs.openstack.org/openstack-infra/infra-specs/specs/translation_setup.html
for full details.

This basically renames
python-magnumclient/locale/python-magnumclient.pot to
magnumclient/locale/magnumclient.pot. For this we need to update
setup.cfg.

The domain name is already correct in magnumclient/i18n.py.

The project has no translations currently, let's remove the outdated
pot file, the updated scripts work without them. So, we can just
delete the file and once there are translations, an updated pot file
together with translations can be imported automatically.

Even though testenvs pep8 and pep8-constraints included cinder/common
directory to be processed by flake8, global configuration in flake8
secion was excluding common glob preventing the directory from being
checked.

This patch removes glob from flake8 exclude section, unnecessary
cinder/common inclusion when running flake8, and fixes
cinder/common/config.py.

If we had a common directory in our code root and wanted to exclude it,
glob should be ./common instead of just common like we had now.

Previously, the assertValidDomainScopedTokenResponse method only ensured
specific attributes were in the token response. These checks didn't ensure
that the token scope never grew.

This change makes it so that the assertion will fail if extra attributes are

A plugin at its most basic is an enabled file and a collection of python and static files. Here is a skeleton of what your plugin should look like. -my_panel/ |-enabled/ |-10000_my_panel.py |-templates/ |-index.html |-static/ |-panel.py |-view.py The enabled folder should contain files that tells horizon how to load your plugin. For more information on what those settings do, refer to [link]. The templates folder contain files that your view should reference. Here we have a single index.html that the view references. The static folder contain files that are considered static resources. Things like javascript, images, html, css are example of static resources. They are collected by django and serve to the web browser upon request. Installing your angular panel plugin ==================================== Now that we have a folder with our plugin, we need to package it so we can install it as a plugin into horizon. Follow the steps below: 1. Run ""python setup.py sdist"" in the folder 2. Run ""./tools/with_venv.sh pip install my_workflow/sdist/..tar.gz"" in horizon 3. Copy files in the enabled folder to openstack_dashboard/local/enabled 4. Restart Apache or your Django test server We recommend that you create a similar script below to help expedite these procedures. We will be repeat these steps many times as we add and test contents in the steps below. To test that your panel works, go to localhost:9000/dashboard and verify that a blank page shows up. If you have gotten to this point, you have successfully created your first plugin! Follow the next steps to populate your blank page with angular content. How to create an angular module ============================== An angular panel is really just a python panel with angular code doing the rendering. To create an angular panel, we will create a python panel with a view that points to some angular content. Remember that angular is a javascript framework that does all of its work in the browser. As such, we must include any angular files in the static folder. -static/ |-dashboards/ |-identity/ |-my_panel/ |-my_panel.module.js |-my_panel.module.spec.js [—module code—] It is important that you compartmentalize your code and create a test file for them. This makes it easier for you to unit test your code. Refer to [link] on how to properly test your code. Why do we need a module file? This allows us to logically separate our plugin logic and create a namespace for it. Now the rest of our angular code will live inside of this module so it will not accidentally override other plugins. How to create an angular table ============================== Tables are the predominant way to display data. In horizon, we have created a framework around this and make it easy of you to add your own table. To create a table, lets add a table folder and some files. -static/ |-dashboards/ |-identity/ |-my_panel/ |-table/ |-table.controller.js |-table.html table.html is the view, this is where you define the markup that makes up your table. If you are a web developer, this should look very familiar to you. Populate the content as you see fit. Here we will use the hz-table and st-table directives to help us speed things up. The key thing to note here is that our html references a controller that we are going to define. [—table.html—] table.controller contains the logic where we fetch our data and display it in the view. The name of this controller MUST match the name of the controller you referenced in your html file. [—table.controller—] Now repackage and reinstall your plugin to see the changes. You should see a table with fake data that you entered. For exercise, try fetching data from the horizon backend using the $http service. How to customize an existing angular workflow ============================================= To customize an existing workflow, we need to find one first. In this example, we will be extending the identity users create workflow. The file is conveniently located according to its path name ‘horizon.dashboard.identity.users.actions.createWorkflowService’. [—createWorkflowService—] (function() { 'use strict'; angular .module('horizon.dashboard.identity.users') .factory('horizon.dashboard.identity.users.actions.createWorkflowService', createWorkflow); createWorkflow.$inject = [ 'horizon.app.core.workflow.factory', 'horizon.dashboard.identity.basePath', 'horizon.framework.util.i18n.gettext' ]; /** * @ngdoc factory * @name horizon.dashboard.identity.users.createWorkflowService * @description A workflow for the create action. */ function createWorkflow(workflowService, basePath, gettext) { var path = basePath + 'users/steps/'; var workflow = workflowService({ title: gettext('Create User'), btnText: { finish: gettext('Create User') }, steps: [ { title: gettext('User Details'), templateUrl: path + 'create-user/create-user.html', helpUrl: path + 'create-user/create-user.help.html', formName: 'createUsersForm' }, { title: gettext('Select Projects'), templateUrl: path + 'select-projects/select-projects.html', helpUrl: path + 'select-projects/select-projects.help.html', formName: 'selectProjectsForm' } ] }); return workflow; } })(); We want to inject our own custom step into this workflow. So lets create a plugin with the following file structure. Refer to the [link] on how to create an angular plugin. -static/ |-dashboards/ |-identity/ |-my_panel/ |-plugin/ |-my_panel.plugin.js |-steps/ |-my_step/ |-my_step.controller.js |-my_step.help.html |-my_step.html my_step.html will contain any content you want to display to the user. It usually contain inputs you want the user to enter for submission. We’ll provide a very simple example of one that asks for your favorite color. <div ng-controller=""horizon.dashboard.identity.users.steps.myStepController""> <h1 translate>Blue Plugin</h1> <div class=""content""> <div class=""subtitle"" translate>My custom step</div> <div translate style=""margin-bottom:1em;""> Place your custom content here! </div> <div class=""selected-source clearfix""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-xs-12 col-sm-8""> <div class=""form-group required""> <label class=""control-label"" translate>Favor color</label> <input type=""text"" class=""form-control"" placeholder=""{$ 'Enter your favorite color'|translate $}""> </div> </div> </div><!-- row --> </div><!-- clearfix --> </div><!-- content --> </div><!-- controller --> In our html, we referenced the myStepController so lets take look at what the controller does. [—myStepController—] (function() { 'use strict'; angular .module('horizon.dashboard.identity.users') .controller('horizon.dashboard.identity.users.steps.blueStepController', blueStepController); blueStepController.$inject = [ '$scope', 'horizon.framework.widgets.wizard.events', 'horizon.dashboard.identity.users.events' ]; /** * @ngdoc controller * @name horizon.dashboard.identity.users.steps.blueStepController */ function blueStepController($scope, wizardEvents, userEvents) { $scope.$on(wizardEvents.ON_SWITCH, function(e, args) { console.info('Wizard is switching step!'); console.info(args); }); $scope.$on(wizardEvents.BEFORE_SUBMIT, function() { console.info('About to submit!'); }); } })(); In our controller, we have the ability to listen to wizard events and the events broadcasted by the create users workflow. This architecture allows us to register to these events and do something. [-plugin.js—] (function () { 'use strict'; angular .module('horizon.dashboard.identity.users') .run(bluePlugin); bluePlugin.$inject = [ 'horizon.dashboard.identity.basePath', 'horizon.dashboard.identity.users.actions.createWorkflowService' ]; function bluePlugin(basePath, workflow) { var path = basePath + 'users/steps/'; workflow.steps.push({ title: gettext('Blue Step'), templateUrl: path + 'blue-step/blue-step.html', helpUrl: path + 'blue-step/blue-step.help.html', formName: 'blueStepForm' }); } })(); Ok now that we have our custom step and the controller for it, lets add this step to the workflow. Our plugin.js allows us to do this easily. All we need to do is inject the createWorkflowService. Notice here that we can append, prepend, before, after the workflow base on an id. In this manner we are able to insert our step into an order of choice. If two teams insert into the same position, they are able to specify a priority to preserve whatever order they may want. Otherwise, the ordering is dependent upon which file gets loaded first. Additionally, you can remove or even replace steps. Refer to inline documentation [link] on the methods available for use. Now that we have completed our plugin, lets package it and test that it works. You may need to rebuild your virtual environment. Refer to [link] on how to package and deploy your plugin. Good luck, and if you have further questions, reach out to us in IRC! ",,249,0

This commit adds a success output for the entire devstack run to the
subunit output. Ideally we wouldn't need this, but because we don't
have timing data for every single operation performed by devstack we
need to do this to track the total duration of the devstack run.

We currently have two issues with venvs:

- if you update your venv on the repo server, it is not possible for
  that updated venv to land on the service's container as the get_url
  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create cinder venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""cinder_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed
- adds multiple service restarts to
  os_cinder/tasks/cinder_install.yml so that cinder will restart
  correctly should the venv/packages update without any associated
  config changes

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

Current patch refactors get_live_state using during
update in Resource class:

Firstly, if get_live_state raises some error, it won't
raise in update method now, just log it and skip live
state updating.

Secondly, if get_live_state returns empty dict, there's
no call of updating old resource's properties.

Thirdly, resource id checking moved from get_live_state
to update method, so there's no necessity to call super
in every override get_live_state method.

Fourthly, tests have been refactored and dupe has been
reduced.

We currently have two issues with venvs:

- if you update your venv on the repo server, it is not possible for
  that updated venv to land on the service's container as the get_url
  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create heat venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""heat_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed
- adds multiple service restarts to
  os_heat/tasks/heat_install.yml so that heat will restart
  correctly should the venv/packages update without any associated
  config changes

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

Currently, transferring a volume in a consistency group would
success. But consistency group is not designed to span multiple
tenants. If the accepted volume is attached to an instance, and
the original user try to delete the CG, it would fail and could
not find the attachment.

This patch fixes it by adding a check in transfer API accept. It
raises InvalidVolume exception if the volume being transferred
belongs to a consistency group.

This patch changes the keystone_ldap configuration to allow multiple
LDAP identity back-end configurations to be implemented.

Example implementation in user_variables.yml:

keystone_ldap:
  Users:
    url: ""ldap://10.10.10.10""
    user: ""root""
    password: ""secrete""
    ...
  Admins:
    url: ""ldap://20.20.20.20""
    user: ""root""
    password: ""secrete""
    ...

This will place two configuration files into /etc/keystone/domains/,
both of which will be configured to use the LDAP driver.

 - keystone.Users.conf
 - keystone.Admins.conf

Each first level key entry is a domain name. Each entry below that
are key-value pairs for the 'ldap' section in the configuration
file.

Note that the reason why only LDAP is catered for is due to the fact
that LDAP is the only supported driver in OpenStack for
Domain-specific configuration files.

Also the reason that only the identity back-end is catered for is that
the LDAP driver for the role, resource and assignment back-ends have
been deprecated and are scheduled for removal in Mitaka.

UpgradeImpact:

- keystone_ldap's first key tier is now the domain name.
  An existing keystone_ldap configuration entry can be converted by
  renaming the 'ldap' key to the domain name 'Default'.
  **Note** that the domain name entry is case-sensitive.

- keystone_ldap_identity_driver has been removed, as the driver
  for ldap is now simply 'ldap' and there are no other back-end
  options for Keystone at this time.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================= There and back again, a roadmap to API v2 ========================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sahara/+spec/v2-api-experimental-impl As sahara's API has evolved there have been several features introduced in the form of routes and methods and that could be crafted in a more consistent and predictable manner. Additionally, there are several new considerations and methodologies that can only be addressed by updating the major version of the API. This document serves as a roadmap to implement an experimental v2 API which will form the basis of the eventual stable version. Problem description =================== The current version of sahara's REST API, 1.1, contains several methodologies and patterns that have created inconsistencies within the API and with respect to the API Working Group's evolving guidelines[1]. Many of these are due to the iterative nature of the design work, and some have been created at a time before stable guidelines existed. Examples of inconsistencies within the current API: * Inaccurate names for method endpoints, for example ""jobs"" instead of ""job-templates"". * Technology specific parameters in JSON resources, for example ""oozie_job_id"" instead of ""engine_job_id"". * Improper HTTP method usage for some operations, for example using PUT for partial resource updates instead of PATCH. In addition to resolving the inconsistencies in the API, a new version will provide an opportunity to implement features which will improve the experience for consumers of the sahara API. Examples of features to implement in the new API: * Micro-version support to aid in feature discovery by client applications. * Creation of tasks endpoint and infrastructure to improve usage of asynchronous operations. * HREF embedding in responses to improve resource location discovery. These are just a few examples of issues which can be addressed in a new major version API implemenation. Proposed change =============== To address the creation of a new major version API, an experimental ``/v2`` endpoint should be created. This new endpoint will be clearly marked as experimental and no contract of stability will be enforced with regards to the content of its sub-endpoints. Changes to the ``/v2`` endpoint will be tracked through features described in this specification, and through further specifications which will be created to better describe the details of larger changes. When all the changes to the ``/v2`` endpoint have been made such that it has a 1:1 feature compliance with the current API, and the Python sahara client has been updated to use these new endpoints, the experimental status of the API should be assessed with the goal of marking it as stable and ready for public consumption. Initial v2 commit ----------------- The initial changes to create the ``/v2`` endpoint should also include moving the Identity project identifier to a header named ``OpenStack-Project-ID``. In all other respects, the endpoints currently in place for the ``/v1.1`` API will be carried forward into the new endpoint namespace. This will create a solid base point from which to make further changes as the new API evolves and moves towards completion of all features described in the experimental specifications. Removing the project identifier from the URI will help to create more consistent, reusable, routes for client applications and embedded HREFs. This move will also help decouple the notion of URI scoped resources being tied to a single project identifier. Roadmap of changes ------------------ The following list is an overview of all the changes that should be incorporated into the experimental API before it can be considered for migration to stable. These changes are not in order of precedence, and can be carried out in parallel. Some of these changes can be address with simple bugs, which should be marked with ``[APIv2]`` in there names. The more complex changes should be preceeded by specifications marked with the same ``[APIv2]`` moniker in their names. For both types of changes, the commits should contain ``Partial-Implements: bp v2-api-experimental-impl`` to aid in tracking the API conversion process. Overview of changes: * Endpoint changes * /images/{image_id}/tag and /images/{image_id}/untag should be changed to follow the guidelines on tags[2]. * /jobs should be renamed to /job-templates. * /job-executions should be renamed to /jobs. * executing a job template through the /jobs/{job_id}/execute endpoint should be changed to a POST operation on the new /jobs endpoint. * cancelling a job execution through the /job-executions/{job_execution_id}/cancel endpoint should be removed in favor of requesting a cancelled state on a PATCH to the new /jobs/{job_id}. * /job-binary-internals should be removed in favor of /job-binaries as the latter accepts interal database referenced items. * /job-executions/{job_execution_id}/refresh-status should be removed in favor of using a GET on the new /jobs/{job_id} endpoint for running job executions. * all update operations should synchronize around using PATCH instead of PUT for partial resource updates. * JSON payload changes * hadoop_version should be changed to plugin_version. * oozie_job_id should be changed to engine_job_id. * all returned payalods should be wrapped in their type, this is currently true for the API and should remain so for consistency. * HREFs should be embedded in responses that contain references to other objects. * New features * Identity project identifier moved to headers. This will be part of the initial version 2 commit but is worth noting as a major feature change. * Micro-version support to be added, this should be documented fully in a separate specification but should be based on the work done by the ironic[3] and nova[4] projects. Although implemented during the experimental phase, these microversions will not implement the backward compatibility features until the API has been declared stable. Once the API has moved into the stable phase, the microversions will only implement backward compatibility for version 2, and only for features added after the stable release. This list is not meant to contain all the possible future changes, but a window of the minimum necessary changes to be made before the new API can be declared as stable. The move to stable for this API should not occur before the Python sahara client has been updated to use the new functionality. Alternatives ------------ An alternative might be to make changes to the current version API, but this is inadvisable as it breaks the API version contract for end users. Although the current version API can be changed, there is no way to safely make the proposed changes without breaking backward compatibility. As the proposed changes are quite large in nature it is not advisable to create a ""1.2"" version of the API. Data model impact ----------------- Most of these changes will not require modifications to the data model. The two main exceptions are the payload name changes for ``hadoop_version`` and ``oozie_job_id``. As the data model will continue to be used for the v1.1 API until it is deprecated, it is not advisable to rename these fields at this time. When the v2 API has been made stable, and the v1.1 API has been deprecated, these fields should be revisisted and changed in the data model. REST API impact --------------- As this specification is talking to a high level change of the API, the following changes are enumerated in brief. Full details should be created for changes that will require more than just renaming an endpoint. * creation of /v2 root endpoint * removal of {tenant_id} from URI, to be replaced by ``OpenStack-Project-ID`` header on all requests. * removal of POST to /images/{image_id}/tag * removal of POST to /images/{image_id}/untag * creation of GET/PUT/DELETE to /images/{image_id}/tags, this should be followed with a specification describing the new tagging methodology. * creation of GET/PUT/DELETE to /images/{image_id}/tags/{tag_id}, this should also be in the previously mentioned specification on tagging. * move operations on /jobs to /job-templates * move operations /job-executions to /jobs * removal of POST to /jobs/{job_id}/execute * creation of POST to /jobs, this should be defined in a specification about restructuring the job execution endpoint. * removal of GET to /job-executions/{job_execution_id}/cancel * creation of PATCH to /jobs/{job_id}, this should be defined in the specification about restructuring the job exection endpoint. * removal of GET to /job-executions/{job_execution_id}/refresh-status * removal of all /job-binary-internals endpoints. * refactor of PUT to /node-group-templates/{node_group_template_id} into PATCH on same endpoint. * refactor of PUT to /cluster-templates/{cluster_template_id} into PATCH on same endpoint. * refactor of PUT to /job-binaries/{job_binary_id} into PATCH on same endpoint. * refactor of PUT to /data-sources/{data_source_id} into PATCH on same endpoint. Other end user impact --------------------- In the experimental phase, this change should have no noticeable affect on the end user. Once the API has been declared stabled, users will need to switch python-saharaclient versions as well as upgrade their horizon installations to make full use of renamed features. Deployer impact --------------- During the experimental phase, this change will have no effect on deployers. When the API reaches the stable phase, deployers will be responsible for upgrading their installations to ensure that sahara and python-saharaclient are upgraded as well as changing the service catalog to represent the base endpoint. Developer impact ---------------- As this change is targetted for experimental work, developers should know that the details of the v2 API will be constantly changing. There is no guarantee of stability. Sahara-image-elements impact ---------------------------- None Sahara-dashboard / Horizon impact --------------------------------- This change should not require changes to horizon as many of the primitives that are changing already display the proper names, for example ""Job Templates"". When this change moves to the stable phase, horizon should be re-evaluated. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: mimccune (Michael McCune) Other contributors: Work Items ---------- The main work item for this specification is the initial v2 commit. * create v2 endpoint * create code to handle project id in headers * create mappings to current endpoints Dependencies ============ This change should not require new dependencies. Testing ======= Unit tests will be created to exercise the new endpoints. Additionally, the gabbi[5] testing framework should be investigated as a functional testing platform for the REST API. This investigation should be the result a further specification as it will deal with creating a platform for live testing a sahara api server. As the v2 API reaches stable status, and the python-saharaclient has been ported to use the new API, the current functional tests should provide the necessary framework to ensure successful end-to-end testing. Documentation Impact ==================== During the experimental phase, this work will not produce documentation. As the evaluation for stable approaches there will need to be a new version of the WADL files for the api-ref[6] site. There is the possibility that this site will change its format, in which case these API documents will need to be generated. Further, the v2 API should follow keystone's model[6] of publishing the API reference documents in restructured text format to the specs repository. This would make the API much easier to document and update as new specification changes could also propose their API changes to the same repo. Also, the WADL format is very verbose and the future of this format is under question within the OpenStack documentation community[7]. The effort to make accurate documentation for sahara's API should also include the possibility of creating Swagger[8] output as the v2 API approaches stable status, this should be addressed in a more separate specification as that time approaches.

We currently have two issues with venvs:

- if you update your venv on the repo server, it is not possible for
  that updated venv to land on the service's container as the get_url
  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create neutron venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""neutron_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed
- adds multiple service restarts to
  os_neutron/tasks/neutron_install.yml so that neutron will restart
  correctly should the venv/packages update without any associated
  config changes

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

We currently have two issues with venvs:

- if you update your venv on the repo server, it is not possible for
  that updated venv to land on the service's container as the get_url
  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create nova venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""nova_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed
- adds multiple service restarts to
  os_nova/tasks/nova_install.yml so that nova will restart
  correctly should the venv/packages update without any associated
  config changes

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

We currently have two issues with venvs:

- if you update your venv on the repo server, it is not possible for
  that updated venv to land on the service's container as the get_url
  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create keystone venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""keystone_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed
- adds multiple Apache restarts to
  os_keystone/tasks/keystone_install.yml so that keystone will restart
  correctly should the venv/packages update without any associated
  config changes

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

To use this feature, you must: #. Use InfiniBand enabled network adapters. #. Run InfiniBand subnet managers to enable InfiniBand fabric. All InfiniBand networks must have a subnet manager running for the network to function. This is true even when doing a simple network of two machines with no switch and the cards are plugged in back-to-back. A subnet manager is required for the link on the cards to come up. It is possible to have more than one subnet manager. In this case, one of them will act as the master, and any other will act as a slave that will take over when the master subnet manager fails. #. Install the ``ebrctl`` utility on the compute nodes. Check that ``ebrctl`` is listed somewhere in ``/etc/nova/rootwrap.d/*``: .. code-block:: console $ grep 'ebrctl' /etc/nova/rootwrap.d/* If ``ebrctl`` does not appear in any of the rootwrap files, add this to the ``/etc/nova/rootwrap.d/compute.filters`` file in the ``[Filters]`` section. .. code-block:: ini [Filters] ebrctl: CommandFilter, ebrctl, root",Neutron sriov-agent --------------------~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,48,10

We currently have two issues with venvs:

- if you update your venv on the repo server, it is not possible for
  that updated venv to land on the service's container as the get_url
  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create ceilometer venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""ceilometer_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed
- adds multiple service restarts to
  os_ceilometer/tasks/ceilometer_install.yml so that ceilometer will
  restart correctly should the venv/packages update without any
  associated config changes

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

We currently have two issues with venvs:

- if you update your venv on the repo server, it is not possible for
  that updated venv to land on the service's container as the get_url
  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create aodh venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""aodh_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed
- adds multiple service restarts to
  os_aodh/tasks/aodh_install.yml so that aodh will restart
  correctly should the venv/packages update without any associated
  config changes

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

virtual disk which belongs to the temporary VM created by ImportVApp.
This works for both vSAN and VMFS datastores.

This introduces microversion 2.18 which signals that the {project_id}
is no longer required in URLs.

It tests this with an additional scenario in api_samples which makes
all the requests without the project_id in the url (using a different
noauth middleware to accomplish this).

Update the link fixer in the ApiSamples matching code to also update
for optional project_id. This is the least worse approach here,
because if we set request_api_version, then we have to duplicate the
entire template tree as well, which we definitely don't want to do, as
it now correctly handles either url form.

This updates the auth tests to bifurcate with testscenarios instead of
the subclass model, which makes for more consistent tests.

In order to support adding routes without project_id we have to be
able to restrict project_id something that doesn't match any of our
top level routes.

The default for this is [0-9a-f\-]+ which will match all of the
following:

 - keystone default generated project_ids [0-9a-f]{32}
 - integer project_ids (\d+) - known in use by RAX
 - uuids with dashes (no known users, but suspect there might be)

This can be overrided with the new (but already deprecated)
``project_id_regex`` config option.

NOTE: we used this feature to expand the regex to match 'fake' and
'openstack' as valid project ids in tests. Those concepts are deeply
embedded in our tests, and need to be unwound independently.

Stress tests use configured credential by default and
after removing the support of those depricated cred from devstack
stress experimental job started failing.

Using dynamic cred by default there.

Another issue is that stress tests do not pass domain name
in case of identity v3 API which leads to failure.
This was hidden issue as stress tests were not running with dynamic creds.

DHCP Lease failure is happening intermittently in the CI and
is happening more regularly now than it used to before.

The sequence of operations is as follows under nova networks:
* n-net calls dhcp_release (we can see logs in screen-n-net.log)
* dhcp_release has a socket call to dnsmasq (you can see logs for dnsmasq
  in syslog)
* dnsmasq calls dhcpscript with add/old/del arguments

We try to fix this by making sure dnsmasq has enough time to
reload its configuration and has enough time to call nova dhcpscript
for all the existing leases. we do this by two ways:

Firstly, by adding a sleep immediately after SIGHUP, so in the same
thread if there are calls to dhcp_release they are executed after a
slight delay giving enough time to reload the configuration

Secondly, to be sure that during reload calls to nova dhcpscript
execute quickly, we have to return control back quickly to dnsmasq
The double fork trick usually used for daemon(s) is used here to
make sure that we do that and we still have code that calls the
RPC cast API asynchronously in a forked child process

assertTrue is weaker than assertEqual(True,..) because
assertEqual also compares the type.

If we expect a boolean and know that we are getting a boolean then
assert for a boolean, not for something that evaluates to true.

This reverts commit e995d73488731c47c2e3cc3de7e0b52869ef298e.

The custom serializer support in the wsgi stack was to support XML
responses. It is a ton of complexity for no gain. Removing this
greatly simplifies the response path for the wsgi code.

Tests which only tested functionality that was removed, are also

The change applies to the following image backends:
- preallocated Qcow2 images
- preallocated Raw images
- non-sparse Lvm images

The Rbd backend was left out as the IO mode setting
does not apply to the network clients in qemu.

When booting multiple instances at once using max_count it's possible
to exceed the port quota in Neutron. Currently, we proceed with
booting min(quota_value, max_count) number of instances and only
issue a debug message to Nova logs. It may be unclear to an operator,

The RPC API call describe_stack_resource is used by two separate ReST API
calls and one CFN API call: Resource.show and Resource.metadata in heat-api
and StackController.describe_stack_resource. The metadata call in
particular throws away all of the results of the describe_stack_resource
output except for the metadata itself. Either this call or the cfn one
(depending on configuration) is also used very, very often: it's the one
that every instance running os-collect-config polls for information about
software deployments (so, to a first approximation, every server in every
stack will be calling this once every 30s).

Since blueprint detailed-resource-show merged in
6d8a5cb35cec81b23a71e8c6fa692f8e7b4dca1c, every call to the RPC
describe_stack_resource API has resulted in Heat fetching the attribute
values for every single attribute in the resource from its corresponding
OpenStack API (including those calls originating from a request for just
the metadata, or from the cfn API which similarly discards the attribute
values).

This is insanely inefficient (we're making OpenStack API calls to fetch
data that we don't even return to the user). It's quite possibly a
substantial part of the reason why we've had so much difficulty scaling up
Heat to deal with large numbers of servers polling it for config. And it
tends to leave a lot of annoying warnings in the log messages, not just of
Heat but also the other services it is polling, since polling the metadata
generally happens using the heat_stack_user's credentials, not those of the
actual owner of the resource - it can't actually find the resource and
returns a 404.

The fix is to change the default ""with_attr"" value in the RPC client to
False, and only pass None (the previous default) or a list of extra
attributes to include in the specific case where the ReST API will actually
return the attribute values to the user and not just discard them. Since
the server previously treated any falsey value for the parameter (e.g.
None, False or []) as equivalent, and since nothing was previously passing
False, this change is safe to backport to stable branches. The api and
engine can be updated in any order without change in behaviour until a new
api is talking to a new server (at which point the bug is fixed).

This change also updates the ReST API unit tests to accurately reflect the
data returned from the engine.

We currently have two issues with venvs:

- if you update your venv on the repo server, it is not possible for
  that updated venv to land on the service's container as the get_url
  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- updates repo_build/tasks/repo_venv_build.yml to create checksum files
  of each venv tarball
- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create horizon venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""horizon_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

Assuming this logic is correct, this review can be updated so that all
similar roles can be updated accordingly.

We currently have two issues with venvs:

- if you update your venv on the repo server, it is not possible for
  that updated venv to land on the service's container as the get_url
  task always skips if the file exists (even if the file is different)
- if you have an updated venv on the repo server and forcefully delete
  the cached venv tarball on the service's container, the new tarball
  will get unarchived over top of the existing venv

This commit does the following:

- gets the checksum of the /var/cache tarball and downloads checksum
  file from repo server
- updates ""Attempt venv download"" to only download the venv if the
  cache doesn't exist or if the local and remote checksums differ
- adds a ""force: true"" to ""Attempt venv download"" task so that the venv
  tarball will get re-downloaded when the when condition is true (this
  is necessary otherwise the download will get skipped since the
  destination already exists)
- adds a new task ""Remove existing venv"" so we can first remove the
  venv before we unarchive the potentially new venv from the repo
  server
- updates ""Create glance venv dir"" and ""Unarchive pre-built venv""
  tasks to only proceed if ""glance_get_venv | changed"", which
  prevents these tasks from running when they the venv tarball hasn't
  changed
- adds multiple service restarts to
  os_glance/tasks/glance_install.yml so that glance will restart
  correctly should the venv/packages update without any associated
  config changes

NOTE: The reason why we compare local and remote checksum is to avoid
      unnecessarily downloading the venv when the checksums are in fact
      the same.  On small deploys this is more or less a non-issue but
      if a deploy w/ thousands of compute nodes re-runs playbooks we
      want to limit the venv downloads when it's unnecessary.

Currently, upgrading a horizon package/venv does not explicitly trigger
a restart.  A restart will only occur if an explicit or implicit config
change occurs.

This commit adds several restart notifiers such that a horizon package
upgrade or venv replacement will force a restart.

Note that this issue exists in all OpenStack roles at the moment, but
the remaining roles are being addressed in their re-deploy venv
reviews.  The horizon re-deploy venv change was merged a while back
which is why we need the separate review for this.

Problem Description =================== As a service providing a snapshot of the OpenStack eco-system, we expect the following trait: * The snapshot is up to date and coherent, independent of the order of the updates received from the other various OpenStack services. Anything less and we will have failed our users with a deluge of undependable data. Background ---------- When created, an ElasticSearch document is stored in an index. When deleted, we barbarically engage in Damnatio Memoriae and the ElasticSearch document is permanently removed from the index. In most cases this is not an issue and the document is not missed. But computer science is fraught with corner cases. There are cases where the existence of a deleted document needs to be remembered. The main case is concerned with the asynchronous nature of receiving SearchLight commands. As an example, consider the case where SearchLight is sent a create document command followed by a delete document command. In a small number of cases, the delete document command will be executed first, followed by the create document command. This ordering will have the final result of the document being created. Now when queried by an inquisitive user, SearchLight will embarrassingly return the phantom document as if it corporeally exists. Folie a deux! Not good for anyone involved. We will need to make the SearchLight document CRUD commands order independent. This implies a way to track the state of deleted documents. A deletion with a deletion! A lesser case for keeping track of deleted documents is that this will allow Searchight to more easily provide a ""delta"" functionality if so desired in the future. ElasticSearch provides functionality to enable the tracking of deleted documents. Instead of rashly removing a document, we can avail ourselves of the TTL (Time To Live) field for that document. This will allow the document to exist until all ordering issues are resolved. Once ElasticSearch is asynchronously satisfied, the document will fade away into the distant recesses of SearchLight's collective memory. The concept and use of the TTL field is described in the ElasticSearch guides [2]. Proposed Change =============== Ecce proponente! With this blueprint, the basic idea is to keep the state of a deleted document around until no longer needed. At a high level, we will need to make three major modifications to SearchLight. * We will need to modify the ElasticSearch index mappings. * We will need to modify the delete functionality to take advantage of the new mapping fields. * We will need to modify the query functionality to be aware of the new mapping fields. ElasticSearch Index Mapping Modification Two modifications are needed for the mapping defined for each index. The first modification is to enable the TTL field. We need to define the mapping for a particular index like this: :: { ""mappings"": { ""resource_index"": { ""_ttl"": { ""enabled"": true } } } } By not specifying a default TTL value, a document will not expire until the TTL is explicitly set. Exactly what we need. The second modification is to add a new metadata field to the mapping. We have three options (at least) for defining this field. (1) The metadata field would be named ""deleted"" and would be defined only when a document has been deleted. When a document is created/modified this field is not defined. To detect if a document is deleted we will search for the existence of this field. This simplifies the create/modify code, but complicates the query code. (2) The metadata field would be named ""deleted"" and would always be defined. When the document is created/modified the field would be set to ""False"". When the document is deleted the field would be set to ""True"". This adds a little bit of work to the create/modify but simplifies the query command. (3) The metadata field would be named ""state"" and would always be defined. The value of ""state"" would be the current state of the document: ""Created"", ""Modified"" or ""Deleted"". This will allow for ""delta"" functionality to be added to SearchLight in the future. This work is the same as option (2). SearchLight Delete Functionality Modification When a document is deleted, we will need to set both the TTL field and the metadata field. This is considered a modification to the original document. SearchLight Query Functionality Modification When a document is queried, we will need to modify the query to exclude any documents whose metadata indicates the document has been deleted. We will also need to filter out the metadata field. SearchLight Create/Modify Functionality Modification If we choose to implement either metadata option (2) or (3) we will need to set the value of the metadata field appropriately for a create or a modify command. Configuration Changes: We need to define the TTL value to determine how long a deleted document endures. Seven days is the standard amount of time to be sitting shiva. This default value can be overriden by a configuration value. Setting a TTL value is not enough to delete a document. In tandem we need ElasticSearch to run its purge process. This purge process will poll all documents and delete those with expired TTL values. The default is to run the purge process every 60 seconds. This default value can be overriden by a configuration value.

Problem Description =================== As a user of the searchlight API, we expect the following traits: * The index is up to date and coherent with the source data * The index is available * That we are not affected by updates and upgrades As a deployer, we expect the following: * That we can roll out service upgrades and update the index with new data * That we can bring the index back into coherency without downtime * That we can tune the service deployment according to performance needs * That we can have easy deployment of new / patched plugins Background ---------- ElasticSearch documents are stored and indexed into an ""index"" (imagine that). The index is a logical namespace which points to primary and replica shards where the document is replicated. A shard is a single Apache Lucense instance. The shards are distributed amongst nodes in a cluster. API users only interact with the index and are not exposed to the internals, which ElasticSearch manages based on configuration inputs from the adminstrator. Certain actions can only be done at index creation time, such as changing shard counts, changing the way data is indexed, etc. In addition to changing the data, re-populating an index that has lost coherency with source service data is much easier to do from scratch rather than determining what differences there are in the data. Due to this the data and indexes should be designed so that it is possible to re-index at any time without disruption to API users. In Searchlight 0.1.0, we allowed for each plugin to specify the index where the data should be stored via configuration in the searchlight-api.conf file. By default, all plugins store their data in the ""searchlight"" index. This was simply chosen as a starting point, because the amount of total data indexed for resource instance data is believed to be quite small in comparison to typical log based indexing for small deployments, but this may differ dramatically based on the resource type being indexed and the size of the deployment. In Searchlight 0.1.0, we expose users directly to the index, which generally is not recommended by the user community or by ElasticSearch. Instead, they recommend using Aliases. API users can use an alias in exactly the same way as an index, but it can be changed to point to different index(es) transparently to the user. This allows for seamless migration between indexes, allowing for all of the above use cases to be fulfilled. The concept of aliases is described in depth here: * https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index-aliases.html Proposed Change =============== With this blueprint, we intend to expose aliases rather than indexes to the end user. This will affect: * The plugins API which lists plugins * The Listener * The bulk indexer * The CLI The ideal usage scenario would look like the following: Queries to v1/search/plugins would change so that the index listed for each type would actually be the alias (the API user won't know this). The searchlight-manage index sync CLI will change to support the following capabilities: * re-index the current index without migrating the alias (no change from 0.1.0) * delete the specified or current index for a specific type * create a new index for specified resource types * specified name or autogenerated name using a post-fix numbering pattern * contact and stop all listeners from processing incoming notifications for specified types * switch alias automatically when complete (default - no ?) * delete old index automatically when complete (default - no?) * contact and start all listeners to process incoming notification for specified types * switch alias on demand to new index(es) All of the above must account for 1 ... * indexes for a single alias. All listener processes must now support a management API for them to stop notification processing for specified resource types. Without this ability, there will remain a race condition for populating a new index. For example, if it takes N seconds to populate all Nova server instances, there will be a delay in time from when the original request for data to Nova was sent and when any udates to the data happened. Therefore, notification should be disabled while a new index is being populated and then turned back on. In addition, all notification handlers MUST index the source service last update date and must ensure that it only processes a notification if the update date in the notification message is newer than the update date of the same resource instance indexed into Searchlight. Alternatives ------------ What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those?

Follow new infra setup for translations, see spec
http://specs.openstack.org/openstack-infra/infra-specs/specs/translation_setup.html
for full details.

This basically renames
python-neutronclient/locale/python-neutronclient.pot to
neutronclient/locale/neutronclient. For this we need to update
setup.cfg. The domain name is already correct in neutronclient/_i18n.py.

There's no need to keep the pot file. The updated scripts work without them.
So, we can just delete the file and once there are translations,
an updated pot file together with translations can be imported.

Data Model Impact ------------------ Model:: +-------------------------------+ | Classifier | +-------------------------------+ | id | | name(Optional) | | protocol(Optional) | | src_port_range_min(Optional) | | src_port_range_max(Optional) | | dst_port_range_min(Optional) | | dst_port_range_max(Optional) | | ethertype(Optional) | | src_ip_prefix(Optional) | | dst_ip_prefix(Optional) | +-------------------------------+ FYI: the classifier table's data model is designed by reference to the securitygrouprules table of Neutron. Difference between the classifier talbe and the securitygrouprules table: * direction is deleted * src and dst are added to port_range_max, port_range_min and ip_prefix(i.e. src_port_range_max, dst_port_range_max, etc...)

(It follows the definition of IANA. http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml ) When src_ip_prefix of classifier is specified, source ip address of the packet is to be a match and if within the range of CIDR specified in src_ip_prefix. When dst_ip_prefix of classifier is specified, if source ip address of packet is within range of CIDR which is specified in src_ip_prefix, it will be regard as matching. Classifier should be specified as one or more from each of the protocol, src_port_range, dst_port_range, src_ip_prefix or dst_ip_prefix.

If live_migration_flag or block_migration_flag does not include the
VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER libvirt migration flag, then migrations will
fail with a warning like:

  Live Migration failure: Requested operation is not valid:
  direct migration is not supported by the connection driver

We should avoid invalid configurations like this, and warn users about
it.

However, there is a caveat - with the xen virt type, the reverse is
actually true. Peer-to-peer migrations are not supported in libvirt's
xen driver, so we must remove the VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER for migrations
to work with that driver.

This commit adds a success output for the entire devstack run to the
subunit output. Ideally we wouldn't need this, but because we don't
have timing data for every single operation performed by devstack we
need to do this to track the total duration of the devstack run.

To capture failures this commit adds saving a devstack event when we
trip the exit_trap. This will save a similar result to the stream in
the successful case, but instead mark it as a failure.

This is backported from master branch to generate subunit result so
d-g can collect it from the new location.

There is a race between where Xen creates the domain and starts logging
and when XAPI returns to say that the domain has started.

If the cronjob to rotate the guest logs runs in this period, it can
delete the console logs before we set the last_dom_id which is used to
preserve logs.

This change adds a fixed delay before deleting any log files, allowing
the VM start operation to return after the domain has been successfully
created.

Clear an active user hook when an exit exception occurs (e.g. the thread is
cancelled). Previously we only caught Exception so exit exceptions were
excluded.

To also cover the case of an unclean exit (e.g. kill -9), don't wait on a
hook that is left over from some previous stack operation - only start the
hook if it is set in the current environment.

Unlike these, Packetary uses a plain text string, which is inconvenient. We need to unify the data format for all commands and operations. ---------------- Proposed changes ---------------- We propose to use in Packetary the same data format used in Nailgun and Fuel-mirror. The proposed data format is the following: 1. Repositories input data format: * name field - A single word identifying the repository name * uri field - Uniform Resource Identifier for repository root. Describe in rfc3986 * type field - single word. It can be ""rpm"" or ""deb"", depending to the packages format which used in the repository * suite field - Describe repositories types ($release, $release-security, $release-updates, $release-backports). This is applicable only for DEB repositories. * section field - a list of areas separated by a whitespace. This is applicable only for DEB repositories. * priority field - Integer field that allows changing the behaviour of selecting a package. In general, the format depends on the repository driver. For example: DEB repository expects values from 0 to 1000. 0 to have lowest priority and 1000 -- the highest. RPM repository expects values in the range of 1 to 99 inclusive. A priority of 1 is the highest setting, and 99 is the lowest. If this field is not specified, the driver will select the minimal possible value. Required fields are: name, uri, type, priority. As an example for RPM repositories, the input data format will have the following yaml format: .. code-block:: yaml repos: - name: ""centos"" uri: ""http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/x86_64"" type: ""rpm"" priority: 1 - name: ""centos-updates"" uri: ""http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/updates/x86_64"" type: ""rpm"" priority: 99 And for DEB repositories: .. code-block:: yaml repos: - name: ""ubuntu"" uri: ""http://localhost/ubuntu/updates"" suite: ""trusty"" section: ""main multiverse restricted universe"" type: ""deb"" priority: 1000 - name: ""ubuntu-updates"" uri: ""http://localhost/ubuntu/updates"" suite: ""trusty-updates"" section: ""main multiverse restricted universe"" type: ""deb"" priority: 500 2. To use the following fields for the packages input data format: * name field - A single word identifying the package name * versions field - An optional parameter that specifies versions of the package. It is usually a sequence of integers separated by a dot. Before it can be a relational operator (eq, gt, lt, ge, le). When specifying two or more versions in the package, it is necessary to use logic AND operator between versions. This means that the engine will select the package that satisfies all the specified versions. For example: .. code-block:: yaml packages: - name: openssl versions: - "">=1.0.1"" - ""<1.0.2e-1ubuntu1"" 3. Removes dependencies logic between the repositories and adds priority to the repositories. 4. Packages search in the repositories according to the building repositories list order.

Can not create node network group with name of already existing group
""Default"" network group the first in a list
Deletion of several node network groups one after another
Can not create node network group without saving changes
Switching between node network groups without saved changes
The same VLAN for different node network groups (Neutron VLAN segmentation)
Gateways appear for two or more node network groups (Neutron VLAN segmentation)
Validation between default and non-default groups
Validation Floating IP range with non-default group with other CIDR
Renaming of Default and non-default network groups
Correct bahaviour of long name for node network group

Since Fuel in a part of OpenStack, we must use OpenStack coding style. ------------------- Problem description ------------------- There is eslint-config-openstack project which contains .eslintrc with rules for all OpenStack projects. Fuel's .eslintrc is significantly different - it contains extra rules and different values. Switching to OpenStack style will make it easier for external contributors to contribute. ---------------- Proposed changes ---------------- Fuel's .eslintrc needs to be rewritten to extend eslint-config-openstack. It's possible to disable some rules from eslint-config-openstack if there is a valid reason, but the number of such rules should be minimal. It's ok for extra rules (which are not present in eslint-config-openstack) to stay. React and ES6 rules should also stay in .eslintrc. Fuel UI code should be updated accordingly. Web UI ====== Fuel UI code needs to be fixed according to the new rules to pass CI. Nailgun ======= Data model ---------- None REST API -------- None Orchestration ============= RPC Protocol ------------ None Fuel Client =========== None Plugins ======= None Fuel Library ============ ------------ Alternatives ------------ None -------------- Upgrade impact -------------- None --------------- Security impact --------------- None -------------------- Notifications impact -------------------- None --------------- End user impact --------------- None ------------------ Performance impact ------------------ None ----------------- Deployment impact ----------------- None ---------------- Developer impact ---------------- It will take some time for active contributors to adapt to the new coding style. For new contributors which are familiar with other OpenStack projects it will be easier to start contributing. --------------------- Infrastructure impact --------------------- None -------------------- Documentation impact -------------------- None -------------- Implementation -------------- Assignee(s) =========== Primary assignee: vkramskikh@mirantis.com Other contributors: astepanchuk@mirantis.com jkirnosova@mirantis.com kpimenova@mirantis.com Mandatory design review: astepanchuk@mirantis.com jkirnosova@mirantis.com kpimenova@mirantis.com Work Items ========== The rules should be enable one-by-one. The diffs can be very large, so it's preferred to finish transition at the beginning of the development cycle to avoid conflicts. Dependencies ============ * eslint-config-openstack NPM module should be added to package.json as a devDependency. ----------- Testing, QA ----------- Fuel CI runs ESLint as a part of verify-fuel-web-ui job, so all the changes are tested automatically. Acceptance criteria =================== The following rules need to be used from eslint-config-openstack (i.e. they shouldn't be overriden in Fuel's .eslintrc): * complexity * eqeqeq * no-script-url * indent * one-var * max-len * no-sync ---------- References ---------- http://eslint.org/ http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/eslint-config-openstack ",,231,0

Among those things, current Jenkins focuses on the following two jobs: 1. Building/testing software projects continuously, just like CruiseControl or DamageControl. In a nutshell, Jenkins provides what's known as a 'continuous integration system', to make it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and easier for users to obtain a fresh build. The automated, continuous build approach simplifies how new code gets integrated and consumed. 2. Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs, such as cron jobs and procmail jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine. For example, with cron, all you receive is regular e-mails that capture the output, and it is up to you to look at them diligently and notice when it broke.

As a database server, its primary function is to store data, securely and supporting best practices, and retrieve it later, as requested by other software applications, be it those on the same computer or those running on another computer across a network (including the Internet). It can handle workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users. Recent versions also provide replication of the database itself for security and scalability. PostgreSQL implements the majority of the SQL:2011 standard, is ACID-compliant and transactional (including most DDL statements) avoiding locking issues using multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), provides immunity to dirty reads and full serializability; handles complex SQL queries using many indexing methods that are not available in other databases; has updateable views and materialized views, triggers, foreign keys; supports functions and stored procedures, and other expandability, and has a large number of extensions written by third parties. In addition to the possibility of working with the major proprietary and open source databases, PostgreSQL supports migration from them, by its extensive standard SQL support and available migration tools. And if proprietary extensions had been used, by its extensibility that can emulate many through some built-in and third-party open source.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================== Improve Nova Instance metering ============================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/improve-nova-instance-metering This proposal will avoid every compute-agents polling Nova API periodically. In production scenario, this change will greatly reduce the workload of Nova api caused by compute-agents polling. Problem description =================== To describe the problem, We assume we have a environment with 500 compute nodes and every compute node deployed with compute-agent (this is a real deployment scale of our company). the polling interval is set as 60s. For every polling period, compute-agent will invoke ""instance_get_all_by_host()"" method (and maybe need querying image and flavor also) to query the instances of this host from Nova API. That means the Nova API will receive 500 requests meanwhile every minutes. It would massively increase the workload of Nova API. In the metadata caching proposal[1], the instance info from Nova will be cached in compute-agent by using 'change-since' query filter of Nova server-list API. That will significantly decrease the amount of items of every Nova query. But that cannot help to reduce the query frequency. To dig the performance singularity of the compute-agent process, for the proposal[1] assuming we can deploy 100 instances on one host at most. we can find it is not a very significant improvement reducing 100 instances to 20 instances of every Nova list query. But it will be a significant improvement that reducing the times of Nova API requests from 500 requests/min to 1 requests/min, this is the goal of this proposal. Proposed change =============== Currently, the *instance* samples is mainly generated by compute-agent, the notification-agent also generate this samples but those will be deprecated. The *instance* metric include the info of instance from in OpenStack layer. The compute-agent is mainly used to collect the info of instance from virt layer, include the metrics of disk, cpu, net, mem, etc. According this, this proposal try to solve the problem described by two main changes: * Move the *instance* metric from compute-agent to central-agent. central-agent will use ""instance_get_all"" to query all instance from Nova API and generate samples ""instance"". The ""instance_get_all"" has also applied ""change-since"" parameter as query filter to massively reduce the amount of every query and cache the instance info didn't updated. see metadata-caching proposal [1]. * The compute-agent running on compute nodes will collector instance metrics only from virt and don't need the instance info from nova any more. Typically, the nova created instance xml from libvirt include the basic info we needed, the instance_uuid, the user_id, the project_id. For more information, please see [2]. With this basic info and the measurements by inspector querying from libvirt API, it is enough to generate the instance samples of disk, cpu, net, mem, etc. Additionally, there maybe need some other changes: * The instances in virt may not all created by OpenStack (orphan instances), these need to be dropped. The instance xml [2] include info to indicate the instance created by OpenStack Nova or not. We can also check and drop when recording samples to storage by comparing with *instance* samples recorded by central-agent. FYI: there is an old proposal for compute-agent improvement tried to do similar works, but is different, see [3]. Alternatives ------------ None. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Pipeline impact --------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance/Scalability Impacts ------------------------------- Previously, in a large-scale deployment, the all compute-agents' periodically polling requests from every compute-agent caused a heavy workload to Nova API. This proposal will change the compute-agent polling->inspecting process to avoid query instances info from Nova API. It will greatly reduce the workload of Nova API and indirectly improve the performance of environment. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: liusheng Ongoing maintainer: liusheng Work Items ---------- * Implement the instance metering in central-agent. * Implement the change in compute-agent to get rid of polling Nova API. * Enable the entry in setup.cfg and test functionality. * Add unit tests and integration tests to check the functionality. Future lifecycle ================ None Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= - The current tests will need to modify to adapt these change. - Unit tests should be add to cover these change. - Integration tests (e.g. auto-scaling) should be added or tested to test these change. Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation should be updated to add description for this.

There is a difference in how Swift and radosgw behave when a zero
length write is aborted. Swift returns 499 and doesn't create an object,
but radosgw appears to creates a zero size object. Because of this, new
behaviour which was introduced to prevent zero-size chunks being written
worked for Swift, but appears not to work for the radosgw case.

This patch changes how we detect a zero size chunk so that no request
is made to the backend. We no longer rely on the Swift specific behaviour.

Currently we have no way of conditioning an HA router's
state with a custom events.
This is needed in some scenarios that require tracking a
specific entity (i.e. pinging a host's interface) or event
(i.e. a process that is no longer running).

This patch adds the ablitiy to hook user-defined scripts
that will be executed every interval (currently 5 sec).

These script's exit code is used by keepalived to
change the VR to FAULT state (script exited with
value other then 0 - fail)

If the VR is currently in FAULT state and the script
exited with code 0 (success) then the VR will move to
BACKUP. If the VR is MASTER and the script succeeds the
VR will remain MASTER.

The script file is defined in 'l3_agent.ini' under the new
parameter 'ha_health_check_script_path'. the file
specified in that parameter value will be used by keepalived
as a 'track_script' to be ran according to the new
'ha_health_check_script_interval' parameter in
'l3_agent.ini'. This parameter has a default value of
5 seconds.

DocImpact:
Added a new parameter to 'l3_agent.ini' named
'ha_health_check_script_path' that can accept a full path
of a bash script. The script behavior should match the
details in this commit message above.
Added a new parameter to 'l3_agent.ini' named
'ha_health_check_script_interval' which will determine
the VRRP health check interval in seconds.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================================================== Extend IPAM DB Tables to incorporate more use cases ==================================================== https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1513981 The intention of pluggability of IPAM is flexibility. Pluggable IPAM is supposed to allow vendors and users that don't fit reference implementation, to write their own drivers. But the IPAM DB tables have the exact same columns as their previous counterparts. This makes it difficult for some users to take full advantage of pluggable IPAM. With this spec, I would like to propose extending the database schema so that we can incorporate more use cases. Problem Description =================== Pluggable IPAM is powerful in the sense that it allows vendors to write their own drivers to make decisions about network, subnet and IP allocation. In order to make these decisions, vendors (or just users like us) need more information than just available IP count. e.g. 1. One common requirement is that, IP assigned to the instance should belong to a particular rack. This requirement comes from the deployments that have L3 Top-of-Rack where the subnet is confined to the rack. Currently there is no way figure out rack <-> subnet mapping without encoding that information in the subnet name itself. This approach doesn't scale. 2. Another requirement is that, for some deployments, the network architecture is such a way that multiple gateway addresses are configured on the routers. Currently, IPAM subnets do not support multiple gateway addresses. This is a valid use case according to https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1464361 But it can't be supported because its too invasive. With IPAM, we can incorporate such use case and leave use of those multiple gateways to the users. 3. In future, we want to be able to make scheduling decisions based on network architecture. To be able to do that, we need some information associated with the subnet db table. * Rack switch information * Backplane information * DHCP ip helpers * Option to tag allocation pools inside subnets We also want to store some information about the backplanes locally, so a different table might be useful. Current database schema is limited and doesn't incorporate these use cases. A possible solution could be that different vendors and users create their own database and point their IPAM drivers to that. But that approach has a risk that, some of those use cases may never make it to the community. Hence, I would like propose extending the schema for IPAM. Proposed Change =============== * At a very high level, I would like to add more columns to the Subnet table * Rack ID * Backplane ID * Convert Gateways field to a list and update the validation methods * DHCP IP Helpers * Add a column *tag* to Allocation Pools table * Add a new table for Backplanes The requirement can change in future as more and more users chime in.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================== Port Forwarding API ==================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/port-forwarding Port forwarding is a common feature in networking and more specifically in PaaS and SaaS cloud systems which aim at reusing the same public IP for different clients that use different VMs for their services. This is especially relevant for deployments which lack a large number of public IPs they can assign. Common use case for this feature is a client requesting a specific service, the serving platform (PaaS, SaaS) allocate a VM to run the service and then allocate a client port to access this service. This means that various clients use the same public IP, but the TCP/UDP destination port is used to distinguish between the end point VMs. Example: client1 172.24.4.2:4001 => maps to 10.0.0.2 port 80 (VM1) client2 172.24.4.2:4002 => maps to 10.0.0.3 port 80 (VM2) This spec focus on the API level, a detailed reference implementation spec will be written upon approve of API. Problem Description =================== * In tight environments operators would like to reuse public IPs instead of assigning to each VM its own public IP (floating IP). * Docker support port-mapping feature and hence a big eco-system of automation orchestration and management plugins leverage it. We would like to make Neutron compatible for these tools and systems and provide a similar API Proposed Change =============== Introduce port forwarding API and implementation on the public address of the virtual router external gateway interface (connecting the router to a public network). The user can define various port forwarding rules on the router containing the client port and the destination VM and destination port. An optional enhancement for this would be to define extra public IPs on the router external gateway and perform port forwarding on them, but this will be described in more detail in the implementation spec. Implementing this feature per floating IP is complicated due the fact that DNAT in DVR is distributed among the compute nodes, this feature resemble the difficulties and challenges of distributing SNAT and hence at this point should remain in the network node. It seems however that any solution that distribute SNAT will also be able to support distributing port forwarding. Data Model Impact ----------------- The following new table is added as part of the port forwarding feature: CREATE TABLE port_forwarding ( id CHAR(36) NOT NULL PRI KEY, tenant_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL MUL KEY, router_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL MUL KEY, neutron_port_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL MUL KEY, external_client_port INT NOT NULL MUL KEY, dst_ip CHAR(15) NOT NULL, dst_port INT NOT NULL, protocol CHAR(4) NOT NULL, COLLATION utf8_ci PRIMARY KEY, CONSTRAINT router_id_client_port_constraint UNIQUE (router_id, external_client_port), CONSTRAINT neutron_port_dst_port_constraint UNIQUE (neutron_port_id, dst_port), deleted_at DATETIME, deleted INT DEFAULT 0 ); TBD: ---- The port forwarding entry is NATing a specific floating ip:port to a specific Neutron port (and a private IP that is attached to this port). If the Neutron port is deleted, do we also want to remove the port forwarding entries that match this port? (For the floating ip case, when neutron port is deleted the floating ip association is also removed) TBD: ---- Do we want to remove the port_forwarding entries in case the router external gateway is removed? (Currently when a floating ip is configured on a specific router the external gateway can not be removed and also the router itself cannot be deleted) TBD: ---- When floating ip is configured the user currently also cant remove the interface connecting between the neutron port network (the port that the floating ip is assigned too) and the relevant router. We want to perform the same for the port forwarding rules ? *** TBD: -------- Need to see if we can leverage the floating IP structure and mechanism to use with port forwarding. The idea is that we leverage all the code for floating IP and just add a specific type to it which means that the floating IP can be allocated without a new public IP (public IP is supplied as the router gateway external public IP). Of course specific port mapping (tcp/udp ports) is needed to be added to the structure. Data integrity in the DB needs to be handled, if the router is removed all forwarding entries must also be deleted. However if we block the external gateway removal in case that port forwarding entries exists we get the same result.

The “service” can be a layer 4 protocol number combined with source and destination ports, all of which are visible from the L4 payload and by deep packet inspection, can be based on an application ID and L7 fields such as URL strings. An extension is being proposed in this spec that allows the network administrators to create service objects. The customized service objects can then be grouped together to form a service group. The service object and service group abstractions proposed in this spec will be first consumed by the FWaaS implementation, but its applicability is not limited to FWaaS and can be leveraged in other features where such service definition and grouping is required. Problem Description ======================= 1. In FWaaS, an administrator can use port range and protocol in a firewall rule to define the traffic type. But we don't have a flexible way to allow user to specify more than one type of traffic in the same rule. To support different traffic type, with the same source, destination address and action, different rules need to be created. This makes the process of defining firewall rules un-scalable. 2. Many vendors' (eg. Palo Alto Networks, Juniper) implement security policy using service definitions and do not configure protocol and port on the policy directly. We should support the same in the firewall rule for easy integration. As such, adding support for this extension will provide a consistent abstraction for vendors that want to support configuring firewall rules via service definitions. 3. Some vendors also support special attributes for different traffic type, one usage is to allow session idle timeout values for different traffic type. We cannot support this today. Proposed Change ================== We propose to adding a new extension with two resources: . Service Groups . Service Objects A user can define type of traffic using a Service Object.Service Objects can be grouped into Service Groups and referenced from a FWaaS Firewall Rule. Each service object can be optionally defined with a timeout value that can be used to overwrite default session idle timeout value. When being used with firewall rules, the service groups are allowed to be reused among different firewall rules in the same tenant. To simplify the initial implementation, following features are not supported in the first implementation: 1. support of sharing the service object among service groups. 2. support of the case where the cloud provider administrator creates service group for tenant to use. We should be able to add these two features later with backward compatible APIs. The service group can only be deleted if there are no other objects referencing it and in the current case, the referencing object will be firewall rules. A service object can only be deleted if there are no other service groups referencing it. Since most of the firewall vendors support only using service group or service object to configure firewall policy and do not allow a user to configure the protocol and port on the security policy directly, we might deprecate the protocol and port options from the firewall rule resources. But we will delay this decision until later releases. Even though the current document is targeting firewall rule as the user of the service group, the service group could also be useful when configure security group or group policy. In the developer session of Hong Kong openstack summit, some of developers suggested to make service group as global resource. Based on this suggestion, we will make the service group and service object global resources. Here is an example for using service group in firewall rule: Assuming a tenant has two servers that provide certain type of web services on port 8080, 80 and 8000. We can create two firewall rules to permit traffic from any source ip address to these two servers. The service provided from 8000 port has very short idle timeout (10 seconds), the services provided on port 8080 and 80 have default idle timeout neutron service-group-create http-services This will create a service group named as http-services neutron service-object-create --protocol tcp --destination-port 8080 http_object_8080 \ --service-group http-services This creates a service object named http_object_8080 in the http-service group neutron service-object-create --protocol tcp --destination-port 80 http_object_80 \ --service-group http-services This creates a service object named http_object_80 in http-service group neutron service-object-create --protocol tcp --destination-port 8000 --timeout 10 \ http_object_8000 --service-group http-services This creates a service object named http_object_8000 in http-service group, The service idle timeout for this object is 10 seconds. It implies the firewall session that created by this type of traffic has an idle timeout as 10 seconds (comparing the default timeout 1800 seconds) neutron firewall-rule-create --destination-ip-address 10.0.2.1 --service-group \ http-services action permit neutron firewall-rule-create --destination-ip-address 11.0.2.1 --service-group \ http-services action permit These two rules permit traffic from any IP address to service 10.0.2.1 and 11.0.2.1 that match any service defined in the service group http-services In the current reference design, when the firewall rules get pushed to the firewall agent, the plugin already expands firewall rules along with service group content. Note: 1. firewall rule can also be configured with protocol and port range, for current reference design, we will not allow service-group, protocol and port range to be configured together.

The current PostgreSQL driver only look for the host option in URL,
whereas it should also look for the hostname in the URL!

This patch makes sure you can override URL values with options, but also
read those URL values.

applying the filter. On pages with complex elements (e.g. home) or
very large numbers of elements (e.g. tests), this makes filtering
cause far less browser lag, and eliminates delays before typed
characters are shown on screen.

Added wrapper classes which are inherited from base data types str,

the Resource class contain a 'request_ids' attribute
which is populated with a 'x-compute-request-id' or

The network interfaces we created until Liberty differed from the
install-guide in that the node network interfaces in the public network
had an IP address, whereas the install-guide listed them as unnumbered
interfaces.

For Liberty, we are making the interfaces in the public network
unnumbered, too. With this change, the management network and
our pseudo-public network (203.0.113.0/24) can no longer establish
connections with each other, because the way libvirt configures iptables
only forwards established and related connections between these networks,
but not new ones.

Our scripts are supposted to leave the host system alone, but since
libvirt already messes with the host system's iptables and the training
cluster will not work without patching up libvirt's configuration work,
this change seems justified.

The patch modifies libvirt's forwarding rule for virbr interfaces (other
than virbr0 which is used for the default netowrk) and removes the
modifications before destroying the networks so libvirt recognizes the
rule again as its own.

One downside is that this patch prevents libvirt from removing these
forwarding rules if it is called in some other context.

It acts as a template that defines options such as the container orchestration engine, keypair and image for use when Magnum is creating bays using the given baymodel. Container Orchestration Engine (COE) A container orchestration engine manages the lifecycle of one or more containers that make up a cluster, logically represented in Magnum as a bay. Magnum supports a number of container orchestration engines, each with their own pros and cons, including Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Mesos. Pod A pod is a construct spsecific to the kubernetes container orchestration engine. A pod consists of one or more containers that are located together and share context with one another.

to be the same as for an 8CPU & 128G RAM one. Note, that this problem
has nothing to the custom service_workers configurable per each service
in hiera. The global threshold applies only when those are not defined
as well.

The solution is to introduce the workers_ratio (configurable in hiera).
This represents the average workers-to-RAM ratio for a multi process
workers of each known type. The default value is 2000, which is like
10 generic workers of different services to consume 200M each,
or the same as 20 workers X 100M, if there are 20 distinct services.

The workers_ratio serves as an argument for a new global treshold
function limiting the maximum amount of workers for the each distinct
service type. So, there will be no more hardcoded limits of 16 / 100.
Instead, those will be evaluated as a function F(RAM, workers_ratio).
Examples:
F(1G, 2000)=1 global workers threshold for processes;
F(2G, 2000)=2;
F(8G, 2000)=5;
F(64G, 2000)=F(128G, 2000)=30

And the service_workers will be evaluated as:
$threads = min($workers_max,max(12*$physicalprocessorcount,30))
$processess = min(max($::processorcount, 2), $workers_max)
Instead as it was before:
$threads = min(100,max(12*$physicalprocessorcount,30))
$processess = min(max($::processorcount, 2), 16)

(Note that the effective threads value will be doubled for the rabbitmq
thread workers. We don't change other thread workers, like apache2, as they
are implemented to depend on the available RAM already)

Also, add missing noop tests for service workers, address todo for the
rabbitmq in the openstack::nova::controller class (no more needed as
was removed).
