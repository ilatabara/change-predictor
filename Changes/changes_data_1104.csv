In order to facilitate the bulk of the CSS Reorg effort, it was
extremely beneficial to quickly toggle between many different themes
in order to validate proper cascading inheritance.  This work
prompted the following example theme.

The 'material' theme gives an example of how to make use of a 3rd
party theme using the theming functionality.  In addition to
incorporating a theme, loaded as a static asset using
requirements.txt, it also gives examples of how to cleanly override
styles, variables, icon fonts and Django templates.

This theme is replacing 'blue' as the example of how to use a theme
other than 'default'.

To use this theme, add the theme to your local_settings.py:
CUSTOM_THEME_PATH = 'themes/material', recollect and recompress your
static files.

LoadBalancer tests

The tested use case is an autoscaling group of web app servers
behind a loadbalancer.

Test template was rewritten to use AutoScalingGroup, wait conditions and
outputs, so no other client than heat one is used.
Now there is no need to check for VM connectivity,
as stack/resources status COMPLETE now quite reliably means
that the listening servers are running.

This patch should probably also help with narrowing down the causes of
bug 1437203, since it does not checks instance connectivity with SSH.

I agree with what Ruby pointed out at [1] about this change. Not
replacing the file can have bigger consequences such not getting
overwrited even when ironic-conductor is updated (in case we change the
boot.ipxe in the future).

So we should revert this patch and deal with the pain of having to
change the ipxe_boot_script config file and restart the ironic-conductor
if we want to change a custom version of the script.

Since SoftwareDeploymentGroup is really a ResourceGroup, it's capable
of resolving any attribute supported by SoftwareDeployment, including
arbitrary outputs mapped to attributes.  Exposing these via the
SoftwareDeploymentGroup resource provides much better flexibility than
forcing users to mangle everything via stdout.

This has the side-effect of making the existing attributes somewhat
redundant, e.g:

get_attr: [a_sdg, deploy_stdouts]

is exactly equivalent to this:

get_attr: [a_sdg, deploy_stdout]

The deploy_stdout attribute should be transparently reflected from the
SoftwareDeployment resources via the normal ResourceGroup interfaces,
so we could consider deprecating the existing attributes at some point.

Move overcloud-f21-nonha from testing the bash elements and instead make use of
instack. This currently involves a number of projects that have to get pulled
into the upstream openstack infrastructure. There are also some workarounds in
here that we will work on removing while various dependecies move around.

This commit breaks tripleo-ci into 2 distinct code paths once all of the jobs
are ported to instack we should be able drop the legacy code path(along with
support for tripleo-incubator) and return to a single code path.

This ci builds centos7 images eventually the instack based CI to support both
CentOS and Fedora.

In Id1e430e7d050a0b99ac449e2ea435e06cda1c4e6 I made the mistake of not
actually removing grub in 15-remove-grub.

This restores the removal phase and adds a bunch of comments.  It
seems the centos7 and centos (6) images have grub2 installed, but F22
does not; hence the check.

For anyone interested in the history; it seems the whole idea of
removing grub and re-installing it in the finalise stage is to do with
Ubuntu grub scripts failing in the chroot.  It is not clear this does,
or has ever, affected rpm based systems; but that's how it is, so
leave well enough alone.

The whole reasoning behind the rpm download & re-install is actually
explained in If095adc4abb52a19a3aa0b1caebfb3e4d8f605ef, but over time
the comments got lost as code moved around.  I've restored in here
some detailed explaination of why we don't just re-install the package
""normally"".  I've also added a note to the pre-install of various

An HA port needs to point to the correct host (where the master router
is running) in order for L2Population to work.

Hence, this patch introduces two fixes:
* When a port owned by an HA router is up we make sure it points to the
  right node where the master is running, or a random node if there is
  no master yet (This corner case is fixed by the 2nd bullet point).

* When a L3 agent reports it's hosting a master, we need to update the
  port binding to the host the master is now running on. This fixes
  both routers with no elected master (Yet) and failovers.

The object-auditor will catch these problems but in the case of a system crash it is advisable to run an extra, less rate limited sweep, to check for these specific files. You can run this command as follows:: `swift-object-auditor /path/to/object-server/config/file.conf once -z 1000` .. note:: ""-z"" means to only check for zero-byte files at 1000 files per second. It is useful to run the object auditor on a specific device or set of devices. You can run the object-auditor once as follows:: swift-object-auditor /path/to/object-server/config/file.conf once --devices=sda,sdb .. note:: This will run the object auditor on only the sda and sdb devices.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================= Add availability zones for agents ================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/add-availability-zone Implement availability zones for the DHCP and L3 agents. Just like Nova and Cinder, this allows users to specify where the network services run, giving better fault isolation. Problem Description =================== Nova and Cinder have availability zones today. Cloud administrators can assign availability zones to physical nodes based on geographical locations etc. By properly choosing from the provided availability zones, users can minimize their chance of service failures. But, as Neutron doesn't have availability zones, there's no way to put network services under the same availability zone as a VM instance or a VM volume. What happens with Neutron is completely by chance today. A user cannot limit network traffic within an availability zone, risking higher probability of network failure. Also, network traffic can go through long paths between availability zones. DVR and L3 HA can mitigate these issues somewhat, but they don't entirely solve the problem. Proposed Change =============== The availability_zone attribute is added to the Network and Router DB models. The corresponding API resources will see the availability_zone attribute, too. The new attribute will be used by agent schedulers: * Router.availability_zone is used to schedule non-DVR routers and dvr_snat routers. * Network.availability_zone is used to schedule DHCP agents. The new config options availability_zone and default_availability_zone are added. In addition to the above, a new API that lists availability zones will be added. Data Model Impact ----------------- As noted above, the availability_zone attribute is added to the Network and Router DB models. A migration script will be provided. REST API Impact --------------- The following new attribute is added to the network and router API resources: .. csv-table:: CSVTable :header: Attribute Name,Type,Access,Default Value,Validation Conversion,Description availability_zone,string,""RW(post only), all"",""neutron"",string,human-readable name There will be the new availability-zone API resource. Details TBD. Security Impact --------------- None. Notifications Impact -------------------- None. Other End User Impact --------------------- Performance Impact ------------------ This will reduce intra-datacenter traffic and improve performance. IPv6 Impact ----------- None. This proposal is protocol agnostic. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- To make use of this feature, deployers need to set availability_zone in the neutron.conf config files. Developer Impact ---------------- Community Impact ---------------- Alternatives ------------ None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: iwamoto Work Items ---------- * Add availability_zone to the DB models * Add the availability_zone attribute to the API resources * Add the availability-zone API resource so that AZs can be listed * Modify the router and DHCP agent schedulers to be AZ aware Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= Tempest Tests ------------- Functional Tests ---------------- API Tests --------- Tests for the new attribute and the new API resource will be added. Documentation Impact ==================== User Documentation ------------------ The new config options will be documented. Developer Documentation ----------------------- None.

Horizon's pie charts had hard coded styles directly in the JavaScript
code.  This made it impossible for them to inherit any of their look
and feel from the install theme.  This patch fixes that problem.

It was noted, while doing the refactor, that the legend was being
implemented within D3, but this was not necessary at all, since it
has no graphing visuals associated with it.  It was impossible to
allow the legend label sizes to inherit and be configurable from
the css while they were being generated in the SVG.  The height
could never be known unless D3 knew the height of each element.

Noted Improvements:
* Consistent Colors! Colors, even for distribution charts, now come
  from the palette
* All aspects of the charts are now resizable and can inherit the
  sizes of the charts, as well as the paddings and type settings
  from the theme
* A bug in the 'Show Numbers' function was discovered and will be
  fixed as a result
* The legend symbol, which was a hardcoded cube before, is now an
  icon font, and therefore can be customized per theme.  I.E., you
  can now use rectangles, circles, ovals, smiley faces, etc
* It now inherits directly from the Theme

Changing node's properties in Ironic after node is deployed will
count as available resources in Nova, as nova's resource_tracker
will override the *_used keys we set in the driver.

This patch changes the caculation of available resources based on
the instance flavor instead of node to avoid the issue.

The location of subunit2html changed on the images in the gate
so update the path used in the post_test_hook.

Long-term we should just use what's in devstack-gate.

Neutron packaging seems having issues when LBaaS is enabled in
service_plugins Neutron parameter.

As a temporary workaround, we disable it so we can unblock our CI, but
keep LBaaS service installed & working, so we continue the class
testing.

Once packaging is fixed, we will enable the service plugin again.

It also drop the device_driver parameter which is already the default
one in puppet-neutron.

When a caller passes an os_options dict to the Connection class
constructor, the constructor may modify the os_options dict,
which can surprise the caller if they re-use the os_options
dict. Specifically the os_options tenant_name and object_storage_url
may be modified, and the changed values would then leak through to a
subsequent Connection constructed using the same os_options dict.

This fix simply constructs a new dict from the supplied os_options.
The patch also adds a test that covers this and also verifies that
a preauth_url passed as a keyword arg to Connection() will take
precedence over any object_storage_url in an os_options parameter.

In some cases this service account has full admin privileges, may therefore perform any action on your cloud, and should be protected appropriately. ### Affected Services / Software ### Most OpenStack services / all versions ### Discussion ### In many cases OpenStack services require an OpenStack account to perform actions such as validating Keystone tokens. The default deployment configuration grants administrative level access to these service accounts, and therefore service accounts are very powerful. A service account with administrator access could be used to: - destroy/modify/access data - create or destroy admin accounts - potentially escalate to undercloud access - log in to Horizon ### Recommended Actions ### Service accounts can use the ""service"" role rather than admin. You can check what role the service account has by performing the following steps: 1. List roles: openstack role list 2. Check the role assignment for the service user in question: openstack role assignment list --user <service_user> 3. Compare the ID listed in the ""role"" column from step 2 with the role IDs listed in step 1. If the role is listed as ""admin"", the service account has full admin privileges on the cloud. It is possible to change the role to ""service"" for some accounts but this may have unexpected consequences for services such as Nova and Neutron, and is therefore not recommended for inexperienced admins. If a service account does have admin, it's advisable to closely monitor login events for that user to ensure that it is not used unexpectedly. In particular pay attention to unusual IPs using the service account. ### Contacts / References ### This OSSN : https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0054 Original LaunchPad Bug : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1464750 OpenStack Security ML : openstack-security@lists.openstack.org OpenStack Security Group : https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg ",,54,0

The way safe_str is used is incorrect in case of python 3 and not
consistent in case of python 2. For example the following outputs depend
on the state of the whole string rather than each character in py2:

safe_str(""\u0000"") => ""\x00""
safe_str(""\uffff"") => ""\\uffff""
safe_str(""\u0000\uffff"") => ""\\x00\\uffff""

(null is encoded once as null byte, once as string ""\x00"")

The replacement function applies to both Str and Bytes node contexts and
ensures that both representations always agree, at least in case of the
first 256 byte values / codepoints.

The result of Context.string_val_as_escaped_bytes is always printable
ascii and should be used when strings have unknown encoding, but should
be compared to a known value.

When developing sahara, if you need to use a OpenStack client you should check the ``sahara.utils.openstack`` package for the appropriate one. When developing new OpenStack client interactions in sahara, it is important to understand the ``sahara.service.sessions`` package and the usage of keystone ``Session`` and auth plugin objects(for example, ``Token`` or ``Password``). Sahara is migrating all clients to use this authentication methodology, where available.

Debugging issues with the multitenacy aggregate filter is difficult
as one does not know if the filter_tenant_id is matched or not.

This patch added in a log debug that indicates the reason for the
filter being valid.

While resizing/revert-resizing instance, if instance gets deleted
in between, then instance files remains either on the source or
destination compute node.

To address this issue, added a new periodic task
'_cleanup_incomplete_migrations' which takes care of deleting
instance files from source/destination compute nodes and then
mark migration record as failed so that it doesn't appear again
in the next periodic task run.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Use keystoneclient Sessions ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/python-glanceclient/+spec/session-objects Keystoneclient sessions are being used as a common base library to standardize handling of tokens and authentication credentials going beyond a basic username and password. This improves security as a single point of update for these issues and means that additional authentication mechanisms may be added transparently to individual clients. Glanceclient should adopt sessions as other clients have. Problem description =================== The OpenStack clients all grew rather organically. Each handled their own authentication and this was copied and pasted between every service. This results in: * inconsistencies with what parameters are accepted between clients. * A security issue when bugs are found and need to be patched in each client. * Inconsistent use of the service catalog, regions etc. * Problems adding new features as they become available in keystone. Glanceclient is structured differently from the other clients. It is one of the few that nicely separates the responsibilities of the CLI and the library. However it does do custom HTTPS handling and other security related fixes that are not reused amongst other components. Because of offloading to the CLI it does not handle things like token refreshing, and puts the onus of operating the service catalog onto the user - generally other services. Proposed change =============== I want to bring glanceclient more inline with other clients. Now that there is the facilities that things like the service catalog can be managed consistently by other libraries there is less of an excuse for glanceclient to avoid using this information. This will involve creating a different type of HTTPClient in the event that session and other options are detected. This will allow glanceclient to continue to operate as it does today unless users opt-in by using new parameters. These new parameters are managed by the keystoneclient Adapter object and so will simply involve passing kwargs through. The CRUD layers of glanceclient and the requests path will be unaffected. Alternatives ------------ Glanceclient can continue to operate as it does now. This is not as bad as other clients as it pushes this configuration back on the service, rather than incorrectly handling options internally. However this makes it a special case and glanceclient will not benefit from the efforts to standardize authentication flows and options that the other services gain. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- This change will reimplement how glanceclient handles authentication, token management and how you select endpoints. It handles this though by offloading these concepts to keystoneclient so that any security issues can be handled there. It will deprecate the custom HTTPs handling that glanceclient does. It is my understanding that this custom handling was largely to disable BEAST style attacks by preventing the client from advertising SSL compression capabilities. Whilst compatibility will be maintained for the current client it may not be possible to maintain this functionality when using a common handling logic. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- The flow on effect here is that other services that have credentials and parameters in config files that are used to talk to glance will be standardized with other services. Developer impact ---------------- This will change the parameters that are provided when establishing a glanceclient. The new parameters are standardized across all the other OpenStack client libraries. Existing parameters will obviously be maintained and deprecated in time. This will greatly assist integration with service to service communication as auth_token middleware is providing an auth plugin that can be used directly, as well as standardizing the options that are used for all the clients. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: jamielennox Other contributors: Reviewers --------- I would appreciate anyone who wants to be a point of contact for review. Core reviewer(s): None at this time Work Items ---------- * There are some initial changes to testing that are required to fit the new model. These are considered generally useful and not necessarily specific to this review. * Add session handling and handling of existing parameters to the glanceclient. * Convert the glanceclient CLI to use the standard parameters and option handling. In other projects I have done this for we have not always completed this step. Most clients are moving towards the OpenStackClient project for CLI and are not worried about significant refactoring of their CLI applications. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= We can unit test these changes. It should also be possible to use a testscenarios approach such that existing CRUD tests are run with both a traditionally created client and a client created with a session. Documentation Impact ==================== Update documentation on how to instantiate a Client. References ========== None ",,186,0

The stuff is an proposal to improve the PUT/GET performance in the case of Erasure Coding with more than 1 regions ensuring original data even though 1 of them would be gone. Problem description =================== Swift is now supprting Erasure Code which ensures higher durability and lower disk cost than replicated case for one region cluster. However, when Swift operated on 2 regions, using < 2x data redundancy (e.g. ec_k=10, ec_m=4) and then one of the regions is gone by some unfortunate reasons (e.g. huge earthquake, fire, tsunami), current Swift EC has a chance for data lost. That is because, assuming each region has even available volume of disks, each region should have around 7 fragments less than ec_k and Erasure Code scheme cannot build the origional data from less fragments than ec_k. That's worse thing for 2 region EC cluster. To protect stored data and to ensure higher durability, Swift has to keep >= 1 data size for each region (i.e. >= 2x for 2 regions) by employing larger ec_m like ec_m=14 for ec_k=10. However, it will sacrifices encode performance. In my measurement running PyECLib encode/decode at Intel Xeon E5-2630v3 [1], the benchmark result was as follows: +----------------+----+----+---------+---------+ |scheme |ec_k|ec_m|encode |decode | +================+====+====+=========+=========+ |jerasure_rs_vand|10 |4 |7.6Gbps |12.21Gbps| +----------------+----+----+---------+---------+ | |10 |14 |2.67Gbps |12.27Gbps| +----------------+----+----+---------+---------+ | |20 |4 |7.6Gbps |12.87Gbps| +----------------+----+----+---------+---------+ | |20 |24 |1.6Gbps |12.37Gbps| +----------------+----+----+---------+---------+ |isa_lrs_vand |10 |4 |14.27Gbps|18.4Gbps | +----------------+----+----+---------+---------+ | |10 |14 |6.53Gbps |18.46Gbps| +----------------+----+----+---------+---------+ | |20 |4 |15.33Gbps|18.12Gbps| +----------------+----+----+---------+---------+ | |20 |24 |4.8Gbps |18.66Gbps| +----------------+----+----+---------+---------+ Note that ""decode"" using (ec_k + ec_m) - 2 fragments so performance will decrease less than the result above. In the result above, comparing ec_k=10, ec_m=4 vs ec_k=10, ec_m=14, the encode performance falls down about 1/3 and other stuffs become a similar trend. That's problem to build 2 regions EC cluster. 1: http://ark.intel.com/ja/products/83356/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2630-v3-20M-Cache-2_40-GHz Proposed change =============== Add an option like as ""duplication_factor"". With the option, create duplicated (copied) fragments instead of employing larger ec_m. For example, duplication_factor=2, Swift will encode ec_k=10, ec_m=4 and store 24 fragments (10x2 data fragments and 4x2 parity fragments) in Swift. That need to change PUT/GET and reconstruct sequence to map from the fragment index in Swift to actual fragment index for PyECLib but IMHO we don't need to make an effort to build much modification for the converstaion among proxy-server <-> object-server <-> disks. I don't want describe the implementation in detail in the first patch in spec repository because it should be an idea to improve Swift. Need more discussion for implementation side as following works. Alternatives ------------ We can take a way to use container-sync for the solution for the problem explained in problem description section instead of employing my proposed change. This section describes pros/cons for ""proposed change"" and ""container-sync"". Proposed Change ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Pros: - Higher performance to spread objects across regions (No need to re-decode/encode for transferring across regions) - No extra configuration other than storage policy is needed for users to turn on the global replication. (strictly global erasure coding?) - Able to use global cluster stuff's efficiency (affinity control) Cons: - Need to employ more complex handling around ECObjecController Container-Sync ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Pros: - Simple and able to reuse existing stuffs. Cons: - Need to re-decode/encode to transfer objects to another region - Need to set the sync option for each container. - Impossible to retrieve/reconstruct an object when > ec_m disks unavailable (indudes ip unreachable) Implementation ============== - Proxy-Server PUT/GET path - Object-Reconstructor - (Optional) Ring placement strutegy Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: kota\_ (Kota Tsuyuzaki) Work Items ---------- Develop codes around proxy-server and object-reconstructor Repositories ------------ None Servers ------- None DNS Entries ----------- None Dependencies ============ None ",,151,0

If the hostname has a dash the percona root user set-up will fail.
Also re-running the script fails at the installation of MySQL
since Percona has changed that and it is now not backward compatible,
for this reason the user has to remove all the installed packages.

Added instructions on how to source the correct OS_ environment
variables to run the Monasca and Ceilometer python clients.

Ubuntu Liberty packaging (still considered as unstable) is currently
broken for neutron package [1]

The package works for centos7 so we still have beaker jobs running
RDO trunk, so in the meantime Ubuntu fix the package, let's set it
non-voting to unblock our CI.

This patch is temporary and will probably be reverted as soon Ubuntu
provides stable enough packages for Neutron and other broken
services.

Note: if more broken packages appear in Ubuntu Liberty Staging, we will
probably stop voting on trusty platform.

The fake_pxe driver in Ironic is a driver with a non-op power interface,

This updates the register-nodes command to support use of the fake_pxe
driver with Ironic.

The flake8 C901 was also added to the tox.ini to be ignored. This error

With the addition of hash generation to enforce object versioning
updates to Magnum (see I586f73570dc7b65c83b216d09d11e8dba3c63b2c), most
of the hash generation was just a copy across from Nova. This can be
isolated out here and can be used as helpers in other projects.

In the unit tests of the project using this helper, a
VersionUpdateHelper would be created with the project's object registry,
and also statically generated fingerprints of the existing objects. A
test is then added with the following to test object updates:

    def test_version_updates(self):
        helper = MyVersionUpdateHelper()
        args = helper.get_fingerprint_assertion_args()
        self.assertEqual(*args)

This then tests the generated fingerprints of the current state of
objects and tests them against the static fingerprints in the helper
class. The args returned by get_fingerprint_assertion_args() even
includes an error message to aid developers in how to update the
versions and fingerprints of the objects when things have changed.

The helper class also includes a method
get_additional_version_update_attrs() that can be overridden to add more
attributes on which to add into the fingerprint. If any of these
additional attributes are changed in objects, it will also update the
fingerprint and notify a version update is needed. (ex: Nova uses
child_versions.items() as another attribute on which to update the
version).

Because this is just a helper, all of this is opt-in. If users of
oslo_versionedobjects do not want to test against generated
fingerprints, they do not have to use this helper.

Application to current projects =============================== .. tagged-projects:: team:size-large Rationale ========= Team size is interesting because a large team is a sign of a very active project that is less likely to go away any time soon. Requirements ============ * An active committer is defined as someone with 6 commits over the last 6 months. * An active reviewer is defined as someone with 30 reviews over the last 6 months. * The team must have > 40 active committers. * The team must have > 40 active reviewers. Tag application process ======================= The criteria for this tag is very objective. The TC could approve any future updates to the tag definition and otherwise defer application of the tag. A method for delegating this is TBD, so in the meantime, we default back to the following process: Anyone may propose adding or removing this tag to a set of projects by proposing a change to the openstack/governance repository. The change is reviewed by the Technical Committee and approved using standard resolution approval rules, including discussion at at least one Technical Committee public IRC meeting. A script for this tag is provided to make updating easier. Deprecation =========== There is no deprecation period required for this tag. It can be added or removed at any time. ",,63,0

WSME 0.8.0 adds strict data validation checking. This includes
disallowing any attribute which is not defined in the API data
model to be passed in POST/PUT calls.

We were passing extra attributes, such as trigger_uri for
assembly creation, base_url for language_pack creation,
and plan_uri for component creation. Due to this the tests,
and cli-based user interactions are failing.

This patch fixes above three issues.

For assembly creation tests, we remove the trigger_uri from
the test data as we don't need to pass it anyways.

For language_pack creation, we add the base_url to base types.
The base_url is passed as part of the request body for POST/PUT
when we use the solum cli. Internally this is happening due to
solum cli using the OpenStack common cli which treats the
base_url as one of the keyword arguments and sends all the
kwargs as part of the POST/PUT body.

So probably the right fix here is to modify the OpenStack
common cli to not pass base_url as part of the body. But until
that is done, a workaround is to add the base_url to the list
of attributes to be expected on the API side. That is what we
are doing.

For component creation tests, we add the plan_uri to the component
data model. We are not familiar with the CAMP component data
model to make a call of whether adding a plan_uri to the data
model makes sense or not. I tried removing the plan_uri from
the data that is sent as part of the tests.
That fixed few failing tests, but there
were at least three which were still failing. I have not looked
in details why those remaining tests are failing. But adding
plan_uri on the component API data model seems to make all
tests to pass. So that is what we are doing.

'updates' is default to keep backward compatibility.
Using 'proposed' would be useful to test the current trunk release of
OpenStack if UCA is providing packages for it.

It marks a pivot in our versioning schema from date-based versioning; the previous released version was 2015.1. Full release details are available on Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/ironic/liberty/4.0.0 * Raised API version to 1.11 v1.7 exposes a new 'clean_step' property on the Node resource. v1.8 and v1.9 improve query and filter support v1.10 is a bug fix for Node logical names v1.11 changes the default state of newly created Nodes from AVAILABLE to ENROLL * Support for the new ENROLL workflow during Node creation Previously, all Nodes were created in the ""available"" provision state - before management credentials were validated, hardware was burned in, etc. This could lead to workloads being scheduled to Nodes that were not yet ready for it. Beginning with API v1.11, newly created Nodes begin in the ENROLL state, and must be ""validated"" and ""provided"" before they are made available for provisioning. Clients must be updated to handle the new workflow when they begin sending the X-OpenStack-Ironic-API-Version header with a value >= 1.11. * Migrations from Nova ""baremetal"" have been removed After a deprecation period, the scripts and support for migrating from the old Nova ""baremetal"" driver to the new Nova ""ironic"" driver have been removed from Ironic's tree. * Removal of deprecated vendor driver methods A new @passthru decorator was introduced to the driver API in a previous release. In this release, support for vendor_passthru and driver_vendor_passthru methods has been removed. All in-tree drivers have been updated. Any out of tree drivers which did not update to the @passthru decorator during the previous release will need to do so to be compatible with this release. * Introduce new BootInterface to the Driver API Drivers may optionally add a new BootInterface. This is merely a refactoring of the Driver API to support future improvements. * Several hardware drivers have been added or enhanced - Add OCS Driver - Add UCS Driver - Add Wake-On-Lan Power Driver - ipmitool driver supports IPMI v1.5 - Add support to SNMP driver for ""APC MasterSwitchPlus"" series PDU's - pxe_ilo driver now supports UEFI Secure Boot (previous releases of the iLO driver only supported this for agent_ilo and iscsi_ilo) - Add Virtual Media support to iRMC Driver - Add BIOS config to DRAC Driver - PXE drivers now support GRUB2 2015.1.0 OpenStack ""Kilo"" Release Release notes: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ReleaseNotes/Kilo#OpenStack_Bare_Metal_service_.28Ironic.29 2014.2.0 OpenStack ""Juno"" Release Release notes: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ironic/ReleaseNotes/Juno ",,68,0

This is a first commit os new  murano testing framework.
This commit adds base io.murano.test.testFixture class.
All test classes are suppossed to be inherited from that class.
Test runner accepts only such kind of classes.
Also test cases should start with the 'test' prefix.
setUp method executes before each test case and tearDown - after.

To run tests, authorization params should be provided or murano config file.
Test runner params have a higher priority than the corresponding
params in config.
Package to test is a required parameter.
It's also allowed to specify class to execute tests in or
to specify test case name.
New murano-test-runner was added.

To run all tests from package, execute the following command:
murano-test-runner -p io.murano.test.MyTest1  -l /package/location/directory

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================== Cloud or region namespaces ========================== `bp cloud-or-region-namespaces <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/cloud-or-region-namespaces>`_ OpenStack is getting extended to Intercloud deployment model, where multiple providers setup their clouds and collaborate to support notion of Intercloud. In this model each cloud entity will be operated and managed by different and trusted business partners. The major intent of provider in such collaboration is to reach to to the bigger customer base without having physical presence in other geo-regions. This setup is also beneficial for consumers or users associated with one cloud provider (a.k.a. primary provider) as they seamlessly own computing resources (vms, images, volumes. etc...) from other (a.k.a. secondary providers) cloud providers across Intercloud. This setup is beneficial for both providers and consumers but creates challenges. Problem Description =================== **Definitions** * Intercloud - Collection of loosely integrated distributed heterogeneous clouds, operated and managed by separate business entities, generally trusted business partners. * Distributed Multi-region cloud - Collection of loosely integrated distributed homogeneous clouds, operated and managed by single business entity. **Actors** * Consumer - End user who owns computing resource in cloud. * Primary provider - Cloud provider where user has billing relationship. * Secondary providers - A Cloud provider(s) in Intercloud where consumers owns computing resources apart from primary provider. In Intercloud/distributed MR OpenStack cloud deployment, users may want to own resources (vms, images, volumes) across multiple cloud providers. Keystone entities (domains, projects, users and groups) provide integration with users to their resources and these entities it must have a unique name within their context. Following are the problems user and provider face in such setup: Use Case 1: In most of the deployments providers do not use domain concept as it is not yet transparent to services and they use only the default domain to model the cloud. Cloud provider uses projects to map users and impose users to choose unique names for their projects. This causes problems for the user as they have to deal with multiple project names to model their workload across Interclouds. It would be helpful if they can use the same project name across Intercloud. Use Case 2: It's hard for cloud provider form a particular region in Intercloud to manage and identify resources which they are managing on behalf of other provider. It would be helpful for the cloud provider if they have ability to identify /group all the resources which they are managing for other regions in Intercloud/distributed OpenStack cloud deployment. Use case 3: Keystone enforces uniqueness on domain names withing one OpenStack, due to this consumers may not get same domain name across Intercloud. Proposed Change =============== To solve above mentioned problems we need to introduce a notion of cloud (or region) namespaces for Keystone resources (domain, project, groups and users) as an additional field. The namespace will be a generic concept which will help to scope Keystone resources (hence all the computing resources) to a unique names across Intercloud. The namespace (e.g. cloud.<provider_id>.<region_id>) will represent a cloud provider/region in Intercloud. The namespace will provide uniqueness to the Keystone resources (e.g. projects) with same names across the regions and avoid name collisions. Example 1: User from ""region1/povider1"" want to have project with name ""qa_project"" in region 2 and 3, with namespace (added field in project table) region 2 and 3 both can have ""qa_project"". This will help users to better map their resource to a unique project name across regions/clouds. - cloud.provider1.region1.qa_project - cloud.provider2.region1.qa_project Example 2: Cloud provider from a particular region want to know/group, list of resources (projects, groups, users, vms, images , volumes) they are managing on behalf of other provider's users. This is needed for better accounting and house keeping of resources/usage aggregation of resource usage and metering data. Cloud/region namespace will solve this problem as provider can group resources based on namespace.

Adds support for nova instances, both initial indexing and via
notifications. Both flavor and glance image name can be denormalized
onto the server but currently are not.

Notifications acted upon include those from both nova API and the scheduler;
both must be configured to send notifications to enable full support.
The scheduler is responsible for power events, the API update and create
events. The plugin also listens to neutron notifications which indicate
networking changes to an instance.

(Patch set #3 for the multiple-ipv6-prefixes blueprint)

Provides support for adding multiple IPv6 subnets to an internal router
port. The limitation of one IPv4 subnet per internal router port
remains, though a port may contain one IPv4 subnet with any number of
IPv6 subnets.

This changes the behavior of both the router-interface-add and
router-interface-delete APIs. When router-interface-add is called with
an IPv6 subnet, the subnet will be added to an existing internal port
on the router with the same network ID if the existing port already has
one or more IPv6 subnets. Otherwise, a new port will be created on the
router for that subnet. When calling the router-interface-add with a
port (one that has already been created using the port-create command),
that port will be added to the router if it meets the following
conditions:

        1. The port has no more than one IPv4 subnet.
        2. If the port has any IPv6 subnets, it must not have the same
           network ID as an existing port on the router if the existing
           port has any IPv6 subnets.

If the router-interface-delete command is called with a subnet, that
subnet will be removed from the router port to which it belongs. If the
subnet is the last subnet on a port, the port itself will be deleted
from the router. If the router-interface-delete command is called with
a port, that port will be deleted from the router.

This change also allows the RADVD configuration to support advertising
multiple prefixes on a single router interface.

This patch is a combination of two patches committed to master as the
first patch on its own results in continual gate check fails:

Patch 1:

Removed default lxc profile on container create

Having the lxc container create role drop the lxc-openstack apparmor
profile on all containers anytime its executed leads to the possibility
of the lxc container create task overwriting the running profile on a given
container. If this happens its likley to cause service interruption until the
correct profile is loaded for all containers its effected by the action.

To fix this issue the default ""lxc-openstack"" profile has been removed from the
lxc contianer create task and added to all plays that are known to be executed
within an lxc container. This will ensure that the profile is untouched on
subsequent runs of the lxc-container-create.yml play.

Closes-Bug: 1487130
(cherry picked from commit ffb701f8a3a325e0c321fb2d3e37eea25e66a8af)

Patch 2:

Wait for container ssh after apparmor profile update

This patch adds a wait for the container's sshd to be available
after the container's apparmor profile is updated. When the
profile is updated the container is restarted, so this wait is
essential to the success of the playbook's completion.

It also includes 3 retries which has been found to improve the
rate of success.

Due to an upstream change in behaviour with netaddr 0.7.16 we
need to pin the package to a lower version until Neutron is
adjusted and we bump the Neutron SHA.

Closes-Bug: #1490142

Currently, We can't delete instance system metadata after instance
is deleted because of following reason:
1) We might have 'changed-since' request which will access
the soft deleted system_metadata
2) We might has period audit function which also access the
soft deleted system_metadata

The root cause is the join function filtered the 'deleted'
data of system metadata and it lead to ValueError later.

Conceptually the system metadata is associated with instance,
it will be used in instance's lifecycle, the data will only
be updated so we won't have 2 copies or more system_metadata
for the same instance.
So allow to read it even if it's deleted is safe.

This patch load the system_metadata from db when instance is
in deleted state to avoid can't delete system_metadata issue.

that nova/cinder and os-brick don't have a circular dependency when it

After an update notification, Glance images do not seem
to be searchable. If you filter by the name of the updated
image it will not show up. However, if you re-index, it
will be searchable.

This is due to the code currently indexing a wrapper ""doc""

Previously this only would only occur once on bootstrap. There is
some sequence that was either stopping this from occurring, or it was
becoming reowned by root.

I haven't fully nailed down why this happens but a reasonable workaround
seems to be to just always ensure correct ownership on start by moving
the existing chown outside the set_rabbitmq_cookie function. The
recursive option seems to be unneeded so remove this to be less
invasive.

This patch adds a wait for the container's sshd to be available
after the container's apparmor profile is updated. When the
profile is updated the container is restarted, so this wait is
essential to the success of the playbook's completion.

It also includes 3 retries which has been found to improve the
rate of success.

Due to an upstream change in behaviour with netaddr 0.7.16 we
need to pin the package to a lower version until Neutron is
adjusted and we bump the Neutron SHA.

Workflow represents a process that can be described in a various number of ways and that can do some job interesting to the end user. Each workflow consists of tasks (at least one) describing what exact steps should be made during workflow execution. YAML example ^^^^^^^^^^^^ :: --- version: '2.0' create_vm: description: Simple workflow sample type: direct input: # Input parameter declarations - vm_name - image_ref - flavor_ref output: # Output definition vm_id: <% $.vm_id %> tasks: create_server: action: nova.servers_create name=<% $.vm_name %> image=<% $.image_ref %> flavor=<% $.flavor_ref %> publish: vm_id: <% $.id %> on-success: - wait_for_instance wait_for_instance: action: nova.servers_find id=<% $.vm_id %> status='ACTIVE' retry: delay: 5 count: 15 Workflow Types -------------- Mistral DSL v2 introduces different workflow types and the structure of each workflow type varies according to its semantics. Currently, Mistral provides two workflow types: - `Direct workflow <#direct-workflow>`__ - `Reverse workflow <#reverse-workflow>`__ See corresponding sections for details. Direct Workflow --------------- Direct workflow consists of tasks combined in a graph where every next task starts after another one depending on produced result. So direct workflow has a notion of transition. Direct workflow is considered to be completed if there aren't any transitions left that could be used to jump to next tasks. .. image:: /img/Mistral_direct_workflow.png YAML example ^^^^^^^^^^^^ :: --- version: '2.0' create_vm_and_send_email: type: direct input: - vm_name - image_id - flavor_id output: result: <% $.vm_id %> tasks: create_vm: action: nova.servers_create name=<% $.vm_name %> image=<% $.image_id %> flavor=<% $.flavor_id %> publish: vm_id: <% $.id %> on-error: - send_error_email on-success: - send_success_email send_error_email: action: send_email to='admin@mysite.org' body='Failed to create a VM' on_complete: - fail send_success_email: action: send_email to='admin@mysite.org' body='Vm is successfully created and its id: <% $.vm_id %>' Reverse Workflow ---------------- In reverse workflow all relationships in workflow task graph are dependencies. In order to run this type of workflow we need to specify a task that needs to be completed, it can be conventionally called 'target task'. When Mistral Engine starts a workflow it recursively identifies all the dependencies that need to be completed first. .. image:: /img/Mistral_reverse_workflow.png The figure explains how reverse workflow works. In the example, task **T1** is chosen a target task. So when the workflow starts Mistral will run only tasks **T7**, **T8**, **T5**, **T6**, **T2** and **T1** in the specified order (starting from tasks that have no dependencies). Tasks **T3** and **T4** won't be a part of this workflow because there's no route in the directed graph from **T1** to **T3** or **T4**. YAML example ^^^^^^^^^^^^ :: --- version: '2.0' create_vm_and_send_email: type: reverse input: - vm_name - image_id - flavor_id output: result: <% $.vm_id %> tasks: create_vm: action: nova.servers_create name=<% $.vm_name %> image=<% $.image_id %> flavor=<% $.flavor_id %> publish: vm_id: <% $.id %> search_for_ip: action: nova.floating_ips_findall instance_id=null publish: vm_ip: <% $[0].ip %> associate_ip: action: nova.servers_add_floating_ip server=<% $.vm_id %> address=<% $.vm_ip %> requires: [search_for_ip] send_email: action: send_email to='admin@mysite.org' body='Vm is created and id <% $.vm_id %> and ip address <% $.vm_ip %>' requires: [create_vm, associate_ip] For more details about DSL itself, please see :doc:`Mistral DSL specification </dsl/index>`",TBD,201,2

In the current spec, well defined capabilities have 'cinder_'
prefix.
However, instead of adding 'cinder_' to well defined capabilities,
using vendor name + colon(:) as a prefix for vendor unique
capabilities and using without prefix for well defined capabilities
are more reasonable, because admin can understand which vendor
provides these capabilities in one glance.

This patch fixes these definition in the current spec.

These are fairly standard base keys for Cinder backends. We expect most devices to report at least a boolean True/False for these keys. Let's look at cinder_compression here: This is a well defined key, we expect devices to report True or FalseThe fireproof capability: This is a vendor-unique capability, and is indicated by not being prefixed with 'cinder_'. Also, note that the default is True and that there are NO options. The example indicates that this device is ALWAYS fireproof, youThe cinder_thin_provisioning capability: This is a well_defined capability which is not supported by this particularThe cinder_qos capability describes some corner cases for us: This key is a well_defined key, that's very customizable via options.

Most backend assignment listing is planned to become based on
list_role_assignments. As such this method needs to be tested with
a myriad of different options. We want to avoid having acres of
test code or using complex test algorithms (which often mirror
the code under test) making it difficult to easily determine what
exactly is being tested. Ideally what you want is the ability to
write some kind of data driver shorthand for these tests, which
allows testers and reviewers to see ""at a glance"" if a test scenario
is appropriate and comprehensive.

This patch implements the basic code for a TestHelper that provides
the above by allowing a test to simply be a dict-based test plan.
A few examples of its use are also included. Subsequent patches will

- Add support for effective and inherited options
- Replace existing assignment tests with data-driven test plans and
  add additional tests to widen our coverage.

This patch proposes the following changes
to the 'available' volume:
* Add the --lock-volume flag to cinder migrate
The default value is False, which means the migration is aborted
if the owner of the volume issues commands like attach
or detach during the volume migration. The volume will be in
'available' during migration.
If it is set to True, the migration of this volume will not be
aborted by other commands. The volume will be in 'maintenance'
during migration.

* List migration status for all the volumes
The attribute migration_status will be listed, if the request
is issued by an admin. Otherwise, the migration_status will not
be listed. The option migration_status is added for the admin
to filter the volumes returned via 'cinder list' command.

Configure rados_connect_timeout parameter in glance config

 This patch adds new config option for rados connect timeout,
which tells how much time glance-api  has to  wait before
close the connection.

Setting 'rados_connect_timeout' <= 0  means no timeout.

Guide ----- $ tools/build.py By default, the above command would build all images based on centos image. If you want to change the base distro image, add ``-b``: $ tools/build.py -b ubuntu There are some available base distro image: - fedora - centos - oraclelinux - ubuntu - debian $ tools/build.py --push If you want to build keystone image only, just use the command like: $ tools/build.py keystone If you want to build both keystone and nova, just use the command like: $ tools/build.py keystone nova ``tools/build.py`` use ``kollaglue`` as default namespace. If you want to push images to your dockerhub, change the namespace like: $ tools/build.py -n yourusername --push","The ``tools/build-docker-image`` script in this repository is responsible for building docker images. It is symlinked as ``./build`` inside each Docker image directory. When creating new image directories, you can run the ``tools/update-build-links`` scripts to install the ``build`` symlink (this script will install the symlink anywhere it find a file named ``Dockerfile``). Workflow -------- $ cd docker/keystone $ ./build By default, the above command would build ``kollaglue/centos-rdo-keystone:CID``, where ``CID`` is the current short commit ID. That is, given: $ git rev-parse HEAD 76a16029006a2f5d3b79f1198d81acb6653110e9 The above command would generate ``kollaglue/centos-rdo-keystone:76a1602``. This tagging is meant to prevent developers from stepping on each other or on release images during the development process. $ ./build --push To use these images, you must specify the tag in your ``docker run`` commands: $ docker run kollaglue/centos-rdo-keystone:76a1602 Building releases ----------------- To build into the ``latest`` tag, add ``--release``: $ ./build --release Or to build and push: $ ./build --push --release Build all images at once ------------------------ The ``build-all-docker-images`` script in the tools directory is a wrapper for the ``build-docker-image`` that builds all images, as the name suggests, in the correct order. It responds to the same options as ``build-docker-image`` with the additional ``--from`` and ``--to`` options that allows building only images that have changed between the specified git revisions. For example, to build all images contained in docker directory and push new release: :: $ tools/build-all-docker-images --release --push To build only images modified in test-branch along with their children: :: $ tools/build-all-docker-images --from master --to test-branch Configuration ------------- The ``build-docker-image`` script will look for a file named ``.buildconf`` in the image directory and in the top level of the repository. You can use this to set defaults, such as: :: NAMESPACE=larsks PREFIX=fedora-rdo- This setting would cause images to be tagged into the ``larsks/`` namespace and use Fedora as base image instead of the default CentOS.",26,69

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================= Refactoring Rally Cleanup ========================= Current Rally cleans up all resources in tenants used by benchmark. This proposal should be useful for covering following use cases. Problem description =================== There are 3 use cases that requires cleanup refactoring: #. Benchmarking with existing tenants. Keep existing resources instead of deleting all resources in the tenants. #. Persistence benchmark environment. Once benchmark environment is created, it can be used in multiple tasks. #. Disaster cleanup. Delete all resources created by Rally even if we lose Rally DB. Proposed change =============== Resources created by Rally have same name prefix. At the cleanup, check the prefix and delete only matched resources. * Prefix `rally_` is for resources created by task. These are deleted after finishing the task. * Prefix `ctx_rally_` is for resources created by context. These are deleted when the environment is not necessary. Alternatives ------------ None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: wtakase aka Wataru Takase Work Items ---------- * Rework usage of generate_random_name() that should be called with specific prefix: `rally_` or `ctx_rally_`. * Add name prefix filter for deleting resource which has specified prefix. * Add ability to specify the filter to be used for handling more than one prefix. * Support negative filter which deletes unmatched resources. Dependencies ============ * Add name pattern filter for resource cleanup: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/139643/ * Finish support of benchmarking with existing users: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/168524/ * Add support of persistence benchmark environment: https://github.com/stackforge/rally/blob/master/doc/feature_request/persistence_benchmark_env.rst * Production read cleanups: https://github.com/stackforge/rally/blob/master/doc/feature_request/production_ready_cleanup.rst ",,89,0

Even if the extension is not available rally tries to list lbaas resources
to delete them. This results in a 404 exception.

This commit introduces NeutronLbaasV1Mixin that checks first if the
extension is available. If it's not it returns an empty list of
resources to delete.

All lbaas resources (only pools currently) must inherit from this mixin.

CentOS version of debootstrap creates a broken /dev: /dev/fd is a
directory rather than a symlink to /proc/self/fd. This breaks programs
which make use of /dev/fd/$N. One of such programs is bash. As a result
packages which use bash in their pre- or postinstallation scripts fail
to install into the bootstrap image being built.

To solve the problem make sure /dev/fd is a proper symlink. While at it
create the basic device nodes (/dev/null, /dev/zero, /dev/random, etc)
if they are missing.

Currently ini-style conf files require explicit templates. This has a
number of downsides in terms of maintenance and configurability.

This commit adds a role to the project for generating a conf file based
on a generic template.

The template requires the ansible variables be named using a specific
format:

prefix__confsection__confvariable: confvariablevalue

For example:

  nova_conf__DEFAULT__verbose: true

__ is the default separator, it is used to split the ansible variable
into the parts for use in the template.

Ansible variables are only allowed to contain [a-zA-Z0-9_]. In most
cases that is sufficient however there a conf files where section names
contain other characters e.g. ':' or '-'. This means there needs to be a
way to allow them to be inserted when required. The role will allow
mappings to be specified for the purpose.

An example of how an option in the swift.conf file would be handled:

  swift_conf__swift__hyphen__hash__swift_hash_path_prefix = ""changeme""

The prefix is swift_conf, swift__hyphen__hash is the section in the conf
file, swift_hash_path_prefix is the option name and ""chanageme"" is the
value.

The config Ansible vars must be found in hostvars[inventory_hostname]
but they may reference vars not found in there.

The user is enabled to choose between entering a network address
manually or to allocate a network address from a pool. With the
advent of address scopes in Neutron this feature will be used for
enabling routing of globally unique addresses (GUA) all the way in
to the VM. This is a prerequisite for IPv6 to be routable, and will
also at some point allow GUA-IPv4 without NAT.

Workflow:
If subnet allocation is not supported in backend, there are no
subnet pools available, or the user chooses to enter network address
manually the form will behave like before.

If subnet allocation is supported in backend and there either are
subnet pools available or the label for the default subnet pool(s) is
configured, the user may choose to allocate a network address from a
pool. The user will be presented with two new drop-down menus. The
first drop-down menu will, in addition to the default pool (if
configured), present the names and prefixes of available pools. The
next drop-down menu will display available choices for prefix lengths
(it will not be displayed if the ""default pool"" is selected). The
available choices are defined by the subnet pool. Default prefix length
defined by the pool will be selected. The correct IP version is used
based on what IP version is defined by the selected subnet pool.

The ""Create Subnet"" checkbox has been moved from the Subnet step to
the first step of the workflow. This is because of how switchable
fields work, and how you can not safely define more than one slug in a
fields ""switch-on"" attribute. For the sake of User Experience, we need
to reliably switch fields based on selected Address source on the
Subnet tab. IMHO it also makes more sense to have this checkbox on the
first step of the workflow, if you just want to create a network you can
now uncheck the ""Create Subnet"" checkbox and click directly on ""Create"".

problem without this implementation is a simple overwrite where
a GET follows before the handoff has put the newer obj back on

This patch bucketizes the fragments by etag and if it doesn't
have enough continues to exhaust the node iterator until it
has a large enough matching set.

devstack patch - I99cfe237291fcb727a32a3ec1d01efe44a7ce3b0
makes Nova v21 API as default for gate jobs.

As all existing nova gate jobs will run against v2.1 API, job
'tempest-dsvm-nova-v21-neutron-full' is more needed.
Also we need job to run tests against v2 API.

This patch remove 'tempest-dsvm-nova-v21-neutron-full' job.
Also rename 'tempest-dsvm-nova-v21-full' job to 'tempest-dsvm-nova-v20-full'
and make it to run against v2 API.

Also making *tempest-dsvm-full* job to run against v2.1 till v2.1 is default
in Devstack.

Nova v2.1 API is CURRENT API now, and Nova v2 API is SUPPORTED API.
So the gate should test Nova v2.1 API by default instead of Nova v2 API.

This commit makes Nova v2.1 API as default API by changing the ""catalog_type""
value to ""computev21"".

Nova v2 API is still SUPPORTED API, so the gate needs to test it also.
For that nova v2 jobs can set catalog_type to ""compute"".
(Current job ""tempest-dsvm-nova-v21-full"" is going to be changed to
""tempest-dsvm-nova-v20-full"" for v2 API testing.

The multiple table files actually made it more difficult to see
the whole picture of the table. You would have to have multiple files
open to correlate the column headers, column data, and details sections.

Future patches can add additional helper directives to simplify this
even further.

Also removed batch actions and row actions from table. We will

Ubuntu Liberty packaging (still considered as unstable) is currently
broken for keystone package.

Since keystone is the common project used by any other modules, we can't
get stuck until they fix the package.
The pacakge works for centos7 so we still have beaker jobs running on
RDO trunk, so in the meantime Ubuntu fix the package, let's set it as
non-voting so it will unblock our CI.

This patch is temporary and will probably be reverted as soon Ubuntu
provides stable enough packages for Keystone and other broken services.

ovsdb server initiates the connection to l2gw agent with the entries in
manager table in ovsdb hardware vtep schema.
A configurable option 'enable_manager' in .ini file is provided so that
the connection can be initiated by the ovsdb server or not based on boolean
value.
By default 'enable_manager' value is False, turn on the variable to True
to initiate the connection from ovsdb server to l2gw agent.

- don't use str()
- clarify what the sp id is
- include docstrings where appropriate
- don't define a new constant for 302

It will also allow inline feedback on the diagram itself. ================================== PBR enhancements to support pip ================================== pip, the Python package installation tool is looking for something very much like pbr. pbr itself will benefit from the generalisations pip is looking for. This is a cross project spec due to the wide ranging impact that this may have. Problem description =================== There are a few places where pbr today doesn't meet pips needs. 1. pbr requires pbr be easy_installable or pre-installed for both from-git and from-tarball installations. This is sufficiently fragile that pip wishes to avoid it from from-tarball situations. pbr has had that requested of it already by OpenStack users. 2. pbr has no way to turn off requirements.txt reflection. This is already planned as part of converging on upstream practices. 3. Needs to be able to generate dynamic entry points based on the Python environment being installed into. e.g. foo, foo2, foo2.7, when installing into Python 2.7, whether globally or a venv. Proposed change =============== embed pbr in sdists ------------------- Via an opt-in option we can embed pbr in the root directory of the sdist. When run from an sdist, the local directory is first in the Python path and this will cause the embedded copy of pbr to be found and loaded. The embedding process will copy a statically defined subset of the pbr source code (and we may wish to refactor things a little to make this more manageable). pbr's non-test code is 128K today uncompressed, 30K compressed - which is tolerable. Embedding all of pbr permits tests, doc builds and so on to all work from an sdist. opt-out of requirements.txt reflection -------------------------------------- We'll add an option, ``skip_requirements_files`` to disable requirements file reflection. When set requirements will be managed via ``setup.cfg`` or ``setup.py`` exclusively. This is in line with our eventual deprecation of those files. entry point merging ------------------- Rather than introducing a template language that wouldn't be supported by wheels, we'll allow setup() to pass in entry points and merge them. That will prevent this being an attractive-nuisance within OpenStack while still permitting pip to perform its current workarounds for the lack of entry point templating in the wider set of tooling. Alternatives ------------ 1. Say 'no, thats not pbr' to pip. Unnecessary. Growing the ecosystem is part of OpenStack's mission. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee/contact: Robert Collins - lifeless Work Items ---------- 1. Embedding pbr in sdists. 2. Opting out of requirements reflection.
