Additionally, the Identity service has been bootstrapped with an administrator account. This account can be used to create other services and endpoints, including public and internal endpoints for the Identity service.#. Configure the administrator account: $ export OS_USERNAME=admin $ export OS_PASSWORD=ADMIN_PASSWORD $ export OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin $ export OS_DEFAULT_DOMAIN=default Replace ``ADMIN_PASSWORD`` with the password used in the ``keystone-manage bootstrap`` command from the section called :doc:`keystone-install`. #. Configure the authentication URL: $ export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:35357/v3#. The Identity service manages a catalog of services for your OpenStack environment. Each service can have one or many endpoints. Each endpoint can be one of three types: admin, internal, and public. In a production environment, the variants might reside on separate networks that service different types of users for security reasons. For instance, the public API network might be visible from the Internet so customers can manage their clouds. The admin API network might be restricted to operators within the organization that manages cloud infrastructure. The internal API network might be restricted to the hosts that contain OpenStack services. Also, OpenStack supports multiple regions for scalability. For simplicity, this guide uses the management network for all endpoint variations and the default ``RegionOne`` region. Together, regions, services, and endpoints created within the Identity service make up the service catalog for a deployment. Other OpenStack services uses the service catalog to determine service availability and where to find other OpenStack services. Each OpenStack service in your deployment will need a service entry with corresponding endpoints stored in the Identity service. The ``keystone-manage bootstrap`` command will automatically create an Identity service, and a corresponding administrator endpoint. Since an admin endpoint already exists for the Identity service, manually creating it is not needed. If you wish to supply public and internal endpoints for your deployments Identity service, those can be created manually using the ``openstack`` client and an administrator account. .. note:: OpenStack generates IDs dynamically, so you will see different values in the example command output."," By default, the Identity service database contains no information to support conventional authentication and catalog services. You must use a temporary authentication token that you created in the section called :doc:`keystone-install` to initialize the service entity and API endpoint for the Identity service... warning:: For security reasons, do not use the temporary authentication token for longer than necessary to initialize the Identity service. #. Configure the authentication token: $ export OS_TOKEN=ADMIN_TOKEN Replace ``ADMIN_TOKEN`` with the authentication token that you generated in the section called :doc:`keystone-install`. For example: $ export OS_TOKEN=294a4c8a8a475f9b9836 #. Configure the endpoint URL: .. code-block:: console $ export OS_URL=http://controller:35357/v3#. The Identity service manages a catalog of services in your OpenStack environment. Services use this catalog to determine the other services available in your environment.

The Identity service manages a catalog of API endpoints associated with the services in your OpenStack environment. Services use this catalog to determine how to communicate with other services in your environment. OpenStack uses three API endpoint variants for each service: admin, internal, and public. The admin API endpoint allows modifying users and projects by default, while the public and internal APIs do not allow these operations. In a production environment, the variants might reside on separate networks that service different types of users for security reasons. For instance, the public API network might be visible from the Internet so customers can manage their clouds. The admin API network might be restricted to operators within the organization that manages cloud infrastructure.

Previously the linters gate job returned successfully in all cases and it only
checked the playbooks and none of the roles.

- more comprehensive ansible-lint check of the playbooks
- add check for the roles
- gate now fails in case any of the lint processes exit with non-zero
- skip known quirks like using curl and rsync directly in the repo
- default the linters tox task to python2 as ansible-lint does not
  support python3
- fix the envlist in tox.ini to allow running 'tox' without arguments

This commit add regex first while running tempest tox

There is changes in way tempest tox runs tests by using the tempest run
command directly instead of some bash script.

With tempest run you specify a regex with a '--regex' parameter and to
keep backwards compatibility this is added to the tempest tox
definitions.

But in Nova tests scripts it is being used after concurrency and ends up
having a call equivalent to:

  tempest run --regex --concurrency=2 $tempest_regex

which obviously is incorrect. Simply switching the arg order should work here.

Migration 002 sets the password created_at column to a TIMESTAMP type
with a server_default=sql.func.now(). There are a couple problems
that have been uncovered with this change:
* We cannot guarantee that func.now() will generate a UTC timestamp.
* For some older versions of MySQL, the default TIMESTAMP column will
automatically be updated when other columns are updated:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/timestamp-initialization.html

This patch fixes the problem by recreating the password created_at
column back to a DateTime type without a server_default:
1) Drop and recreate the created_at column
2) Update the created_at value
3) Set the created_at column as not nullable

The json deserialization and jsonschema handling in the Placement
API is similar enough throughout that there's no reason why it
shouldn't be consolidated as a utility method.

This does that, and adds unit tests to cover the method.

We decided to defer support for microversions until we have a change
that actually requires this.

Even though the ""old style"" identity spec has been moved to the
attic, we had updated this to indicate support for microversions.
So as to not cause confusion, this is now reverted.

Multiple service types can be specified, for example: ``X-OpenStack-API-Version: identity 3.7, compute 2.12`` The Identity server will ignore any components of the header other than that for the `identity`` service type. The server will respond as appropriate for that microversion, provided that it can support the requested version. It will include the same header in the response to indicate this. If the server does not support the requested version an HTTP ``406 Not Acceptable`` is returned. The version specified by the client is of the form ""X.Y"", where ""X"" is the major version supported and ""Y"" is the microversion within that major version. For Newton, this is ""3.7"". The earliest microversion that can be requested is ""3.6"". Two special values of the header are supported, namely ""latest"" and ""X.latest"", where ""X"" is the major version.

With this change the periodic task '_cleanup_incomplete_migrations' is now able to remove orphaned instance files from compute nodes in case of live-migration failures. There should be no impact since migration status 'error' vs 'failed' should be considered the same thing, it's a failure. ",,9,0

This commit switches the tox commands that run tempest to use tempest
run instead of pretty_tox.sh. Tempest run is the primary method of
running tempest moving forward so we should dogfood it where we can.
This also officially starts the deprecation timer (which was long
overdue as these were unofficially deprecated before) on the
run_tempest.sh and pretty_tox scripts as we move to having a unified
method of running things.

While reviewing nova fix I03be8100155d343eb6a4ea9eda3f1498ad3fb4cf
it was noticed that when you delete a floating IP via the Nova
API which is associated to a server, and using neutron, the
server's instance_info_cache is not directly updated, which is what
populates the server.addresses field. nova-network does refresh the
info_cache when deleting an associated floating IP.

This patch adds validation to a scenario test that runs on both
nova-network and neutron to check this behavior.

When deleting a floating IP associated with Neutron's info_cache we don't
refresh the info_cache after it is deleted.
This patch makes it so the info_cache is refreshed when an associated
floating IP is deleted. If there is no info_cache associated with the
floating IP then info_cache is not refreshed.

Currently 'provisioned_capacity_gb' is expected from
the drivers as part of capability reporting.
If driver does not provide it, it defaults to 'allocated_capacity_gb'.
But if driver does not provide both 'allocated_capacity_gb' and
'provisioned_capacity_gb' then 'provisioned_capacity_gb' defaults to 0.
Which affects later calculation of  'provisioned_ratio'.

Hence fixing it by summing up sizes of all the shares of
that host and taking that as 'provisioned_capacity_gb',
in such case.

This is a squash of 2 backports to fix Galera deployment on Liberty.

1) Enable galera replication for Mariadb 10.1

The generated galera config has to include additional settings for
galera to be active on MariaDB 10.1.
wsrep_on must be explicitely set to ON. On MariaDB 5.5, this was
implicitely set as soon as wsrep_provider was specified.
a valid wsrep_cluster_address must be configured in addition to
wsrep_on, otherwise recovery command mysqld_safe --wsrep-recover
cannot retrieve replication state, and cluster cannot be bootstrapped.
These explicit settings are backward compatible with MariaDB 5.5 since
the two variables exist in both versions of MariaDB.

Closes-Bug: 1563751
(cherry-picked from commit df343c35ce468c34b2102f0158d36017089c776d)

2) [liberty-only] mysql: never add brackets to mysql_bind_host

The patch was submitted in Newton, but we can't backport it:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/369369/
Don't add brackets on mysql_bind_host parameter in Galera config.
Having brackets from this parameter works with old version of
Galera but not newest one.
EPEL upgraded the version of Galera, so we need this change to deploy
TripleO in HA environment

Closes-Bug: #1622755

This is the initial work to have a function that migrates a full HA
architecture as deployed in Mitaka to the HA architecture as deployed in
Newton where only a few resources are managed by pacemaker.

The sequence is the following:
1) We remove the desired services from pacemaker's control. The services
   at this point are still running normally via the systemd service as
   invoked by pacemaker
2) We do a ""systemctl stop <service>"" on all controllers for all the
   services that were removed from pacemaker's control. We do this to make
   sure that during the yum upgrade, the %post sections that call
   ""systemctl try-restart"" do not take ages, because at this point during
   the upgrade rabbit is down. The only exceptions are ""openstack-core""
   and ""delay"" which are dummy pacemaker resources that do not exist on
   the system
3) We do a ""systemctl start <service>"" on all nodes for all the services
   mentioned above.

We should probably merge this patch only when newton has branched as it
is very specific to the M/N upgrade.

The following warning appears in the unit test logs a number of times.

    ""UserWarning: This test uses methods that set internal oslo_db
state, but it does not claim to use the database. This will conflict
with the setup of tests that do use the database and cause failures
later.""

This patch fixes the last two warnings from:

    unit.compute.test_compute_api.py

Note that this warning is only emitted once per unit test worker, so new
offenders will show up in the logs each time you fix a test until they
are all gone.

In nova/cmd/manage.py, on line 294 [1] there is the following line:

  if value['limit'] < 0 or value['limit'] is None:

The problem occurs when value['limit'] is None, as this line tries
to compare None (object) with an integer value.

This comparsion is totally okay (without errors) in Python27.
But, if you run this on Python34, a TypError is raised:

  TypeError: unorderable types: NoneType() < int()

It is simply fixed with swapping the two expressions within the

when iPXE is enabled, it is possible for the bootloader to download
the deploy kernel and ramdisk directly from Swift TempURL instead of
downloading them to conductor and serving from local HTTP server.

This patch adds the required logic and a new config option
`ipxe_use_swift` (default False), setting which to True enables
using Swift TempURLs for deploy ramdisk and kernel.

Note that local caching and serving for kernel and ramdisk of user image
is still performed for partition images that require non-local boot,
as moving those to use TempURLs will make it impossible for the user
to reboot the instance when TempURLs time out or image is deleted from
Glance/Swift.

This will allow for better scaling across a designate system as we move forward. upgrade: - To enable ``designate-worker`` and ``designate-producer`` add a section to your ``designate.conf`` called ``[service:worker]`` and add an option ``enabled = True``.

In Newton, Aodh will be using its own mysql DB rather than

migrate any existing alarm and alrm history data from

with a aodh-data-migration utility. We need to invoke this

objects.Quotas.count(server_group_members) won't increase, and
instance group quota check invalid. This makes an issue that user
could spawn with one call more instances in server group than
was allowed in quota_server_group_members is it was below
instances quota settting.

When a resource failed, the stack state was set to FAILED and current
traversal was set to emoty string. The actual traversal was lost and
there was no way to delete the sync points belonging to the actual
traversal.

This change keeps the current traversal when you do a state set, so that
later you can delete the sync points belonging to it. Also, the current
traversal is set to empty when the stack has failed and there is no need
to rollback.

The way how we handled the regular expressions had a lot of
limitation.

 - We are not able to pass huge arguments to testr, it makes
   difficult to have long list if accepted and/or rejected test cases,
   but we can pass a path to a file of test cases,
   which can be arbitrary big.
 - How we wanted to handle the backlists before was not worked together
   with the regular selecting regex because it consumed the pattern.
   Now the blacklisting happens in a separated phase after the selecting
   regex search.

This change just allows the new code path to run when both
 a blacklist_file and a selecting regexp specified.

The new way depends on the usual test discovery and just
filters the output of the discovery command,
this strategy can be the default in the future, now I just
wanted to preserve the old behavior as much as possible in
all the other cases.

Destruction dependencies are going to be used during all kinds of garbage collection: pre-deployment (""offline""), on-demand (during deployment) and post-deployment.1. Detect all the objects going to be destroyed. It can be done by utilizing Python GC to track and collect objects, as it described later in ""Garbage collection executions"" section. IF (A owns B) THEN A>B ELSE IF (A has-a-destruction-dependency-on B) The objects which are considered to be equal by the algorithm above can be destroyed in parallel. The result of the sorting is the dictionary with indexes as keys and lists of objects with equal destruction priority as values. 3. For each index in the dictionary start parallel destruction of all objects in the corresponding group. Destruction of individual object means the following:objects as ""destroyed"". It means setting object's ``destroyed`` attribute to ``True`` and removing the self-reference from it. MuranoPL executor will not allow to execute any methods on such objects, however their properties remain accessible (i.e. readable) soWhen ""destroyed"" objects are unreferenced from the object graph their properties get nullified and they get destroyed automatically by Python GC.To implement p.3 above a new algorithm is needed. As it was mentioned in ""Multi-step destruction"" section, Python garbage collector can be utilized for that. MuranoPL can make use of the way Python's ``gc.collect`` works. Python library ``gc`` allows to run on-demand garbage collection via ``gc.collect()`` method and provides access to unreachable objects that the collector found but cannot free via collection ``gc.garbage`` [2]. To make use of this, the following changes should be done: * make object store have weak links only and prevent hard links in other dsl places so that only links between objects remain * prevent murano objects that should have been destroyed by Python GC from being destroyed * get the list of such objects and destroy them in correct order and notify subscribers about destruction. The prevention can be done by adding ``__del__()`` magic method to the MuranoObject class and creating cyclic reference in the object to itself. When ``gc.collect()`` is done, all unreachable objects can be examined and murano objects owned by current executor can be distinguished among them. The difference in Python 3.4 and higher is that objects with a ``__del__()`` method don't end up in ``gc.garbage`` anymore and this list should be empty most of the time [3]. So logic of adding object to GC candidates can be added directly to ``__del__()``. It means that in Python versions 3.4 and higher murano objects will be added to planned destruction from ``__del__()`` call caused by ``gc.collect()``, and in versions prior to 3.4 presence of ``__del__()`` along with cyclic reference to itself will provide adding the object to ``gc.garbage`` list, and it can be added to candidates for destruction from there. This logic can be used for garbage collection in all three scenarios mentioned above.* ``isDoomed(object)`` - can be used within the ``.destroy()`` method to test if other object is also going to be destroyed. * ``subscribeDestruction(target, handler=null)`` - establishes a destruction dependency from the caller to the object passed as ``target``. Method may be called several times, in this case only a single destruction dependency will be established, however the same amount of calls of ``unsubscribeDestruction`` will be required to remove it. instance method defined by the caller class to handle notification of handler is executed for p. 3.1) The following arguments will be passed to the handler method:* ``unsubscribeDestruction(target, handler=null)`` - removes the destruction dependency from the caller to the object passed as ``target``. Method may be called several times without any side-effects. If ``subscribeDestruction`` was called more than once the same (or more) amount of calls to ``unsubscribeDestruction`` is needed to remove the dependency. ``handler`` argument is optional and must correspond the handler passed during subscription if it was provided back then.* Implement collecting unreferenced murano objects utilizing Python ``gc`` library other than the one it is executed from* the right order of events occurs (B scheduled for destruction -> A is notified about inevitable B's destruction -> B's ``.destroy`` method is called -> B gets destroyed); * A may prevent B's destruction by establishing a reference on B in the* A may establish more than 1 destruction dependency on B and still beits methods, as well as the design guidelines for application developers to follow to utilize the new capability.[2] https://docs.python.org/2/library/gc.html [3] https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html","For now it's proposed to use destruction dependencies only for runtime garbage collection. Probably, it will be implemented when we find a solution for issue mentioned above in `Known issues`_. 1. Detect all the objects going to be destroyed using either comparison of current object graph with its snapshot or the reference detection (see ""Offline"" and ""Online"" changes in ""Problem description"" section) IF (A has-a-destruction-dependency-on B) ELSE IF (A owns B) THEN A>B .. note:: The destruction order of objects which are considered to be equal by the algorithm above is undefined. Even more, future implementations may destroy such objects in parallel. 3. For each object in the list:objects as ""destroyed"". MuranoPL executor will not allow to execute any methods on such objects, however their properties remain accessible (i.e. readable) soWhen the destroyed objects are unreferenced from the object graph they go away without additional actions: garbage collector ignores them since their resources have already been released.To implement p.3 above a new algorithm is needed. It should analyze all the active contexts of all the running greenthreads of the current deployment and retrieve all the data variables from that context, traversing through the parent contexts as well. All the objects of ``MuranoObject`` type collected this way should be added to the ""queue of active roots"" to be used for further processing. For each object of this queue the algorithm should save the id of the object into the ""result set"" and then find objects which are reachable from the current one (i.e. the objects of ``MuranoObject`` type contained in properties of any kind). For each such object the algorithm should check whether its id is already present in the ""result set"". If not, the object is added to the end of ""queue of active roots"". The algorithm runs till it processes all the objects of the queue. The ""result set"" which the algorithm gets at the end of this process contains the ids of alive objects. All other objects of the object store should be considered as candidates for garbage collection. There should be one additional check made before doing the actual destruction: some of the objects may have no valid access paths from MuranoPL objects, but could be referenced from some python-back objects. This happens when an Object is passed to some method backed with pythonic code. In this case the executor creates an object of type ``MuranoObjectInterface`` - a wrapper to simplify the work with a murano object from python. This object contains a reference to the actual MuranoPL object within. If appropriate python object is alive, then its corresponding MuranoPL object should not be garbage collected even if there are no references to it from the active roots of MuranoPL. To keep track of such situations the Garbage Collector should contain a special dictionary mapping ids of the objects to the weak proxies pointing to the ``MuranoObjectInterface`` objects passed to pythonic code. For every garbage collection candidate the algorithm should check if there is a map entry for this object and the weak proxy at that entry is alive. If this is true, then the object is excluded from the list of GC candidates.Known issues ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Murano is using ``Objects`` and ``ObjectsCopy`` objects to transfer data between deployments. When destruction dependencies will be implemented handler will make changes (if any) to objects in ``ObjectsCopy``. So, this changes aren't applied during next deployment. It's proposed to change the way of object model generation, with updating new model objects if they have been changed after last deployment. However, solving this issued is not an aim of this specification, so we can skip details. * ``subscribe(target, handler=null)`` - establishes a destruction dependency from the caller to the object passed as ``target``. Method may be called several times, in this case only a single destruction dependency will be established, however the same amount of calls of ``unsubscribe`` will be required to remove it. instance methods defined by the caller class to handle notification of handlers is executed for p. 3.1) The following arguments will be passed to the handler method * ``sender`` - an instance of ``GC`` class describing the current garbage collection session.* ``unsubscribe(target)`` - removes the destruction dependency from the caller to the object passed as ``target``. Method may be called several times without any side-effects. If ``subscribe`` was called more than once the same (or more) amount of calls to ``unsubscribe`` is needed to remove the dependency. An instance of ``GC`` class will be created during the garbage collection session to encapsulate runtime information about this session. It defines a single method which may be of use during a GC session: * ``isDoomed(object)`` - checks if the ``object`` is marked for destruction during this GC session. Pythonic back-end of the ``GC`` class should be able to establish destruction dependencies by storing the back-refs to the dependent object in attributes of the python's instance of MuranoObject representing the dependency. .. note:: This is the opposite of how the destruction dependencies are stored when the model is serialized: in serialized form that is the dependent object who owns the reference to the dependency object. In runtime it is the dependency object who owns the reference to dependent object. When the garbage collection is needed the class will be instantiated and a list of objects-to-delete created based on the current state of object graph, object store and the execution context. Garbage collections will use this object for all the steps of the workflow.* Modify the code which instantiates yaql contexts for MuranoPL so all the created contexts are tracked by the execution session.* Modify an algorithm to collect alive object roots from the runtime and private properties and local variables of executing threads. other than the one it is executed from;* the right order of events occurs (A gets warned about possible B's destruction -> A is notified about inevitable B's destruction -> B is destroyed -> A is notified that B was destroyed); * A may prevent B's destruction by establishing a reference on B in the warning* A may cancel GC in both warning and pre-destroy notification handlers; * A may establish more then 1 destruction dependency on B and still be* ``phase`` property of GC instance is correct in appropriate event handlers; its static and instance methods, as well as the design guidelines for application developers to follow to utilize the new capability.",91,119

This reverts commit 36bf170f347f927fd7f20b5868dc686041081862.

The construction and validation phases of intrinsic functions are
deliberately separated, to:

- Reduce the amount of unnecessary work done
- Reduce the risk of changes to validation breaking the loading of existing
  stacks from the database
- Ensure that the most critical errors are reported to the user first

This patch reverts a commit that sought to combine the two phases. There
was no linked bug and no explanation other than that this 'improved'
things.

It does not, however, restore the check for the Removed function during
properties translation (and the associated test), because I believe its
original existence was based on a misconception. There is no way in
practice for a hot.functions.Removed object to appear in the properties a
translation rule is operating on.

Change I743e676372703e74178c79683dd622d530981e04 removed volume
backend driver calls for creating and restoring volume backups.
The overridden methods for creating and restoring backups in
the VMDK driver is no longer called and this breaks the backup-
restore of volumes created by the VMDK driver. Now backup and
restore of volumes use os-brick connectors.

Change Ia1a20f93780593b1efbb74484c3fdd3ca3564290 added a new
connector in os-brick to support vmdk volumes. The new vmdk
connector requires additional connection info so that it can
connect to vCenter server and access the volume vmdk to perform
volume connect and disconnect.

There you can find each job for each repository: one for the **murano** and another one for **murano-dashboard**. * ``gate-murano-dashboard-ubuntu\*`` verifies each commit to the murano-dashboard repository * ``gate-murano-ubuntu\*`` verifies each commit to the murano repository Other jobs allow to build and test Murano documentation and perform another useful work to support Murano CI infrastructure. All jobs are run on fresh installation of operating system and all components are installed on each run. UI tests ~~~~~~~~ The murano project has a web user interface and all possible user scenarios should be tested. All UI tests are located at the ``https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/murano-dashboard/tree/muranodashboard/tests/functional``. Automated tests for the Murano web UI are written in Python using special Selenium library. This library is used to automate web browser interaction from Python. See official `Selenium documentation <https://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/>`_ for details.-------------- * Install the Python module called nose using either the :command:`easy_install nose` or :command:`pip install nose` command. This will install the nose libraries, as well as the ``nosetests`` script, which you can use to automatically discover and run tests. * Install external Python libraries, which are required for the Murano web UI tests: ``testtools`` and ``selenium``.* To run the tests on a remote server, configure the remote X server. Use VNC Software to see the test results in real-time.Download and run tests ---------------------- To download and run the tests: #. Verify that all additional components has been installed. #. Clone the ``murano-dashboard`` git repository: .. code-block:: console git clone git://git.openstack.org/openstack/murano-dashboard* #. Change the default settings: #. Specify the Murano Repository URL variable for Horizon local settings in ``murano_dashboard/muranodashboard/local/local_settings.d/_50_murano.py``: .. code-block:: console MURANO_REPO_URL = 'http://localhost:8099' #. Copy ``muranodashboard/tests/functional/config/config.conf.sample`` to ``config.conf``. #. Set appropriate URLs and credentials for your OpenStack lab. Only Administrator user are appropriate. .. code-block:: console [murano] horizon_url = http://localhost/dashboard murano_url = http://localhost:8082 user = *** password = *** tenant = *** keystone_url = http://localhost:5000/v3 All tests are kept in ``sanity_check.py`` and divided into 10 test suites: * TestSuiteSmoke - verification of Murano panels; check, that could be open without errors. * TestSuiteEnvironment - verification of all operations with environment are finished successfully. * TestSuiteImage - verification of operations with images. * TestSuiteFields - verification of custom fields validators. * TestSuitePackages - verification of operations with Murano packages. * TestSuiteApplications - verification of Application Catalog page and of application creation process. * TestSuiteAppsPagination - verification of apps pagination in case of many applications installed. * TestSuiteRepository - verification of importing packages and bundles. * TestSuitePackageCategory - verification of main operations with categories. * TestSuiteCategoriesPagination - verification of categories pagination in case of many categories created. * TestSuiteMultipleEnvironments - verification of ability to apply action to multiple environments. To specify which tests/suite to run: * To run all tests: .. code-block:: nosetests sanity_check.py * To run a single suite: .. code-block:: nosetests sanity_check.py:<test suite name> * To run a single test: .. code-block:: nosetests sanity_check.py:<test suite name>.<test name> In case of successful execution, you should see something like this: .. code-block:: ......................... Ran 34 tests in 1.440s OK In case of failure, the folder with screenshots of the last operation of tests that finished with errors would be created. Itis located in ``muranodashboard/tests/functional`` folder. There are also a number of command line options that can be used to control the test execution and generated outputs. For more details about ``nosetests``, type: .. code-block:: nosetests -h Tempest tests ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ All Murano services have tempest-based automated tests, which allow to verify API interfaces and deployment scenarios. Tempest tests for Murano are located at ``https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/murano/tree/murano/tests/functional``.API tests --------- Murano API tests are run on devstack gate and located at ``https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/murano/tree/murano/tests/functional/api``. * ``test_murano_envs.py`` contains test suite with actions on murano environments (create, delete, get, and others). * ``test_murano_sessions.py`` contains test suite with actions on murano sessions (create, delete, get, and others). * ``test_murano_services.py`` contains test suite with actions on murano services (create, delete, get, and others). * ``test_murano_repository.py`` contains test suite with actions on murano package repository. Engine tests ------------ Murano Engine Tests are run on murano-ci at ``https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/murano/tree/murano/tests/functional/engine``: * ``base.py`` contains base test class and tests with actions on deploy Murano services such as Telnet and Apache. Command-line interface tests ---------------------------- Murano CLI tests are currently in the middle of creation.

See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License.===================================== Murano project has separate CI server, which runs tests for all commits and verifies that new code does not break anything.Murano CI url: https://murano-ci.mirantis.com/jenkins/ Anyone can login to that server, using launchpad credentials. There you can find each job for each repository: one for the **murano** and another one for **murano-dashboard**. * ""gate-murano-dashboard-ubuntu\*"" verifies each commit to murano-dashboard repository * ""gate-murano-ubuntu\*"" verifies each commit to murano repository Other jobs allow to build and test Murano documentation and perform another useful work to support Murano CI infrastructure. All jobs are run on fresh installation of operating system and all components are installed on each run. Murano automated tests: UI tests ================================ The murano project has a web user interface and all possible user scenarios should be tested. All UI tests are located at the https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/murano-dashboard/tree/muranodashboard/tests/functional Automated tests for Murano Web UI are written in Python using special Selenium library. This library is used to automate web browser interaction from Python. For more information please visit https://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/ ++++++++++++++ * Install the Python module called nose by performing **easy_install nose** or **pip install nose**. This will install the nose libraries, as well as the nosetests script, which you can use to automatically discover and run tests. * Install external Python libraries, which are required for Murano Web UI tests: **testtools** and **selenium**.* To run the tests on a remote server, configure the remote X server. Use VNC Software to see the test results in real-time.Download and run tests: +++++++++++++++++++++++ First of all make sure that all additional components are installed. * Clone murano-dashboard git repository: * git clone git://git.openstack.org/openstack/murano-dashboard* * To change the default settings: #. Specify the Murano Repository URL variable for Horizon local settings in ``murano_dashboard/muranodashboard/local/local_settings.d/_50_murano.py``: .. code-block:: console MURANO_REPO_URL = 'http://localhost:8099' #. Copy ``muranodashboard/tests/functional/config/config.conf.sample`` to``config.conf``. #. Set appropriate urls and credentials for your OpenStack lab. Only admin users are appropriate. :: [murano] horizon_url = http://localhost/dashboard murano_url = http://localhost:8082 user = *** password = *** tenant = *** keystone_url = http://localhost:5000/v3 All tests are kept in *sanity_check.py* and divided into 10 test suites: * TestSuiteSmoke - verification of Murano panels; check, that could be open without errors. * TestSuiteEnvironment - verification of all operations with environment are finished successfully. * TestSuiteImage - verification of operations with images. * TestSuiteFields - verification of custom fields validators. * TestSuitePackages - verification of operations with Murano packages. * TestSuiteApplications - verification of Application Catalog page and of application creation process. * TestSuiteAppsPagination - verification of apps pagination in case of many applications installed. * TestSuiteRepository - verification of importing packages and bundles. * TestSuitePackageCategory - verification of main operations with categories. * TestSuiteCategoriesPagination - verification of categories pagination in case of many categories created. * TestSuiteMultipleEnvironments - verification of ability to apply action to multiple environments. To specify which tests/suite to run, pass test/suite names on the command line: * to run all tests: ``nosetests sanity_check.py`` * to run a single suite: ``nosetests sanity_check.py:<test suite name>`` * to run a single test: ``nosetests sanity_check.py:<test suite name>.<test name>`` In case of SUCCESS execution, you should see something like this: :: ......................... Ran 34 tests in 1.440s OK In case of FAILURE, folder with screenshots of the last operation of tests that finished with errors would be created. It's located in *muranodashboard/tests/functional* folder. There are also a number of command line options that can be used to control the test execution and generated outputs. For more details about *nosetests*, try: :: nosetests -h Murano Automated Tests: Tempest Tests ===================================== All Murano services have tempest-based automated tests, which allow to verify API interfaces and deployment scenarios. Tempest tests for Murano are located at the: https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/murano/tree/murano/tests/functionalAPI Tests +++++++++ Murano API tests are run on devstack gate and located at https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/murano/tree/murano/tests/functional/api * *test_murano_envs.py* contains test suite with actions on murano's environments(create, delete, get and etc.) * *test_murano_sessions.py* contains test suite with actions on murano's sessions(create, delete, get and etc.) * *test_murano_services.py* contains test suite with actions on murano's services(create, delete, get and etc.) * *test_murano_repository.py* contains test suite with actions on murano's package repository Engine Tests +++++++++++++++++++ Murano Engine Tests are run on murano-ci : https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/murano/tree/murano/tests/functional/engine * *base.py* contains base test class and tests with actions on deploy Murano services such as 'Telnet' and 'Apache'. Command Line Tests +++++++++++++++++++++++++ Murano CLI tests case are currently in the middle of creation. The current scope is read only operations on a cloud that are hard to test via unit tests.

This will generate a certificate in ``/etc/pki/tls/certs`` with a file name that follows the following pattern: undercloud-[undercloud_public_vip].pem This will be a PEM file in a format that HAProxy can understand (See the HAProxy documentation for more information on this). This option for auto-generating certificates uses Certmonger to request and keep track of the certificate. So you will see a certificate with the ID of ``undercloud-haproxy-public-cert`` in certmonger (you can check this by using the ``sudo getcert list`` command). also, this option has the side-effect of extracting Certmonger's local CA to a PEM file that is located in the following path: ``/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/cm-local-ca.pem`` This certificate will then be added to the trusted CA chain, since this is needed to be able to use the undercloud's endpoints with that certificate. It is also possible to enable an FQDN for the certificate. One can achieve this by setting the ``undercloud_public_vip`` to the desired hostname in ``undercloud.conf``. This will in turn also set the keystone endpoints to relevant values. Note that the ``generate_service_certificate`` option doesn't take into account the ``undercloud_service_certificate`` option and will have precedence over it. To enable SSL on the undercloud with a pre-created certificate, you must set the ``undercloud_service_certificate`` option in ``undercloud.conf`` to an appropriate certificate file.

All OpenStack Charms now contain identical tox.ini files,
not to be modified or made unique within each charm repo.

This is to ensure consistency across charm repos in tox
target naming, approach and purpose, also giving the
charm dev and test experience additional consistency.

Also create empty dirs with .keep files where necessary.
Some classic charms have actions and/or lib dirs, and some
do not. In all classic charms, flake will now check those
dirs to ensure lint coverage of existing or future content.

Fix Amulet test connection check and resync charm-helpers
to pull in rabbitmq-server amulet test helper update.

Add osplatform to charm-helper sync yaml to meet new
import requirements in the c-h core and fetch modules.

Disable precise tests until removal of precise nrpe charm
is resolved in the charm-store.

Disable SSL tests for <= trusty targets from xenial hosts.

There's no separate glossary directory anymore, remove special handling
for it.

This also allows to remove the compress_manual_po_files function that
was only needed to skip the glossary.

Change EXCLUDE line, we don't need to ignore source/common anymore since
we do not save pot files there anymore unless needed.

interval values configuration for the periodic tasks. Since the interval
values are passed to a decorator, the configuration options should be
evaluated prior to importing the module which contains the periodic tasks.

In our case this was not happening due to the chain of imports going
from ironic.cmd.conductor -> ironic.common.service -> ironic.api.app
-> ... -> ironic.conductor.manager. This caused the @periodic
decorators to be evaluated before the configuration options were loaded.

This patch breaks that chain of imports by separating the WSGIService
and RPCService classes into two separate files. The conductor uses the
RPCService, and since it is now in a separate file from WSGIService, it
no longer pulls in ironic.api.app, ..., and ironic.conductor.manager.
(ironic.api.app was being imported because WSGIService needed it.)

The exception NotificationEventTypeError was used when an invalid

without causing a ValueError.

Add a unit test to show that changing status to an invalid value does
raise a ValueError.

Remove check for valid status value.

Identity v3 credential APIs return credential information
in 'blob' element which is a dict embedded in string.

And service client does json.load on that and then return the
response which should not be done.

Each service client should return the raw response they gets
from API server.

This commit fix the same and move the json loading of nested dict
on test side.

In order for the test repo to work for CentOS properly, we need to be
able to create multiple networks in a more modular way. Additionally, we
should be able to specify a dict of networks to configure and have them
configured.

To allow this to be extended we setup a network interface ""type"" which
defaults to ""default"". This should cover all current requirements but
could be extended if needed.

For CentOS/Red Hat specifically, we need to drop down post-up/pre-up
scripts for specific networks - this requires an additional loop task to
ensure the appropriate configuration is dropped down.

The Flat and Lvm backends do not create a 'base image' (the file in the
image cache) when creating an ephemeral or swap disk. However, cache()
expects it to exist when checking if a resize is required, which
resulted in an exception.

This was previously address in change I46b5658e. That fix assumed that:

1. Resize is only required for root disks created from images.
2. There will always be an entry in the image cache in this case.

The first assumption is correct, but unfortunately the second is not.
When creating an Rbd-backed instance from an image in an Rbd-backed
glance store, we clone directly from glance and don't create an entry
in the image cache. The code to do this is defined in a callback in
driver._create_and_inject_local_root(). This did not fail prior to any
fix because Rbd.get_disk_size() ignores its argument and always
returns the size of the 'top' disk.

With change I46b5658e we directly tested for an image cache entry,
which doesn't exist in this case, and then didn't do the resize. This
means that in a system configured this way we will never resize a root
disk to the size specified in the flavor.

The new check is simply to check the size of path directly. This
continues to work for Flat and Lvm, as path always exists even when
base doesn't. It also continues to work for Rbd because Rbd still
ignores the given path and uses its own. I'm not entirely sure why we
didn't always do this.

As pointed out by ftersin, this is also part of the fix for resize of
ephemeral disks.

I have retained the test from the original change unmodified because
it still tests that the originally reported bug is fixed. However, I
have not added a test for the Rbd case because:

1. The call path from _create_and_inject_local_root into Rbd is
   sufficiently complex to be very hard to test meaningfully.
2. ...which probably explains why it has never had any test coverage.
3. The real fix is to restructure this code, which is already pending
   review.

Sometimes the mongodb_replset resource fails with:

Could not evaluate: Can't find master host for replicaset tripleo.

This issue is intermittent so the fix cannot be perfectly verified, but
the assumption is that if we wait for MongoDB to be reachable on all
nodes, it will assure that the members will appear to the puppet module
as alive when creating or verifying the replset. If the validation
fails, it should help us uncover which of the members was causing
trouble.

Neutron server returns request_ids:

Due to the bay in CREATE_IN_PROGRESS deletion operation
may cause a lot of abnormal,
so don't support delete the bay in CREATE_IN_PROGRESS.

When deleting a floating IP associated with Neutron's info_cache we don't
refresh the info_cache after it is deleted.
This patch makes it so the info_cache is refreshed when an associated
floating IP is deleted. If there is no info_cache associated with the
floating IP then info_cache is not refreshed.

We are hitting deadlocks in the gate when we are inserting the new
instance_extra row into the DB.

We should follow up this fix and look at way to avoid the deadlock
happening rather than retrying it. It currently doesn't happen too
often, so this should be enough to stop the problem while we work on a
better fix.

IronicHostManager currently overrides the _init_instance_info()
method of the base class and unconditionally skips population of
instances information for all compute nodes, even if they are not
Ironic ones.

If there are compute nodes with the hypervisor_type different from
Ironic in the same cloud. the instances info will be missing in
nova-scheduler (if IronicHostManager is configured as a host manager
impl in nova.conf), which will effectively break instance affinity
filters like DifferentHostFilter or SameHostFilter, that check set
intersections of instances running on a particular host and the ones
passed as a hint for nova-scheduler in a boot request.

IronicHostManager should use the method implementation of the base
class for non-ironic compute nodes.

Ib1ddb44d71f7b085512c1f3fc0544f7b00c754fe fixed the problem with
scheduling, this change is needed to make sure we also populate the
instances info on start of nova-scheduler.

IronicHostManager currently overrides the _get_instance_info() method
of the base class and unconditionally returns an empty dict of
instances for a given compute node.

The problem with that is that in a heterogeneous cloud with both
libvirt and ironic compute nodes this will always return {} for the
former too, which is incorrect and will effectively break instance
affinity filters like DifferentHostFilter or SameHostFilter, that
check set intersections of instances running on a particular host and
the ones passed as a hint for nova-scheduler in a boot request.

IronicHostManager should use the method implementation of the base
class for non-ironic compute nodes.

This is a partial fix which only modifies _get_instance_info() called
down the select_destinations() stack. A following change will modify
_init_instance_info() that pre-populates node instances info on start
of a nova-scheduler process.

libvirt will report ""Selecting disks to migrate is not
implemented for tunneled migration"" while doing block migration
with VIR_MIGRATE_TUNNELLED flag.

This patch does 2 changes:

1. Raise exception.MigrationPreCheckError if block live migration with

2. Remove migrate_disks from params of migrateToURI3 in case of
   tunnelled block live migration w/o mapped volumes since we want

During the Ocata cycle we will work together on enabling the next generation of applications with a design for complex clusters, and better integrating our clusters with OpenStack services for networking and storage. I am only running for PTL for one project, because I want Magnum to be my primary focus. I look forward to your vote, and continued success together. Thanks, Adrian Otto ",,40,0

The Kubernetes external load balancer developer's guide needs to be
updated to reflect the fact that the kubernetes controller manager
has been moved to a separate pod.

Also, the external load balancer dev guide needs to explain that different
versions of Kubernetes require different versions of Neutron LBaaS:

- Kubernetes 1.2 requires Neutron LBaaS v1
- Kubernetes 1.3 (or later) requires Neutron LBaaS v2

metrics.

On the RBD driver the rados_connect_timeout is not working and the
default 300 seconds timeout is being applied.

This is a considerable problem if the connectivity to the cluster is
lost because cinder volume service will get stuck trying to retrieve the
stats and will appear as being down to the scheduler.

The reason for the timeout not being honored is because connect method
in librados library no longer accepts a timeout parameter, so the Python
bindings accept the timeout parameter but ignore it.

As can be read in the Python binding code [1]:
        # NOTE(sileht): timeout was supported by old python API, but
        # this is not something available in C API, so ignore for now
        # and remove it later

This patch fixes this by setting timeouts at the Rados class level.

is that when this is specified if the admin forgets to include

There are various bugs (below) in handling race conditions
while updating the DHCP port during subnet deletion. Due
to the RC1 release, this patch just adds a lock on delete_subnet
and the dhcp RPC port_action handler based on the network_id
to relieve most of the contention until the bugs are resolved.

Deleting subnets is already serialized due to the change in

have a negative performance impact.

This commit updates the Swift Bandit file to the new style
introduced in Bandit 1.0.  In response to the struggle with
getting a Bandit config file working and kept up to date we
introduced a simplified version in Bandit 1.0.
