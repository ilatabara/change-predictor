The following is a description of how shade deals with version discovery in OpenStack. For the most part, a user should never need to think about this, but in some cases it can be useful to know what it's doing and how to affect it. Configuration ============= For any given service, there are two optional values a user can provide, ``{service}_api_version`` and ``{service}_endpoint_override`` - where service is the ``service_type`` value, such as ``compute``, ``image`` or ``file-storage``. It is expected that shade will figure out and do the right thing in the absence of either value and that they should only be needed in exceptional cases. Discovery Algorithm =================== The approach for determining the endpoint is based on whether a version is provided and on whether the service's endpoint in the keystone catalog is versioned or unversioned. The algorithm is as follows: #. If the user has provided ``{service}_endpoint_override`` use it unconditionally. #. Retrieve the discovery document at the URL provided in the catalog. Determine if it is a single or multiple version document (see :ref:`single-or-multiple`) and normalize it (see :ref:`normalize-document`) #. If there is no document at the URL provided in the catalog, find a working document. (see :ref:`find-document`) #. If it is not possible to find a working discovery URL, use the endpoint from the catalog and infer the API version. (see :ref:`inferring-version`) #. If ``{service}_api_version`` is not provided and the discovery document is a multiple version document, pick the endpoint with the latest version that shade knows how to deal with. #. If ``{service}_api_version`` is not provided and the discovery document is a single version document, use the endpoint it contains. #. If ``{service}_api_version`` is provided and the discovery document is a multiple version document, and there is a match in the document for the version requested, use that endpoint. #. If ``{service}_api_version`` is provided and the discovery document is a multiple version document, and there is not an endpoint in the document for the version requested, find the endpoint in the document that matches the endpoint from the catalog and use it, so that version will be known. (see :ref:`matching-endpoints`) If no endpoint matches, use the catalog endpoint and infer the api version (see :ref:`inferring-version`) #. If ``{service}_api_version`` is provided and the discovery document is a single version document and the version in the document matches the provided version, use it. #. If ``{service}_api_version`` is provided and the discovery document is a single version document and the version in the document does not match the provided version, find a better document and apply the discovery algorithm again. (see :ref:`find-document`) #. When an endpoint has been found, expand it and return it for use. (see :ref:`expanding-endpoints`) .. _find-document: Find a Document =============== In some cases, the discovery URL will either not return a document, or will not return the document we want, so we need to look for a new one. The algorithm for that is as follows: #. If the current discovery endpoint ends with a version string of the form ""v[0-9]+.*"", pop that element from the end of the endpoint and return to discovery with this new endpoint. #. Get the curently scoped ``project_id`` from the token, if one exists. #. If the current discovery endpoint ends with the ``project_id``, pop the ``project_id`` from the end of the endpoint but make a note of having done so for later. Return to discovery with this new endpoint. #. If no new endpoint can be found, then return to discovery reporting no working discovery document. .. _inferring-version: Inferring Version ================= In most cases the version of the endpoint should be retreivable from the version discovery document, and in those cases it should be considered the version of the service at the endpoint. There are two cases where a version must be inferred with only the endpoint to go on: * If the user has provided ``{service}_endpoint_override`` with no corresponding ``{service}_api_version``. * If an endpoint could not be found in a discovery document and the endpoint in the catalog is used. The algorithm for inferring the version is as follows: #. If the endpoint contains a path element anywhere that is of the form, ""^v[0-9]+\.?[0-9]*$"", strip the v and use the rest as the version. #. If the endpoint contains no version elements and the service is known to have more than one existing API version, assume the earliest known version. Issue a warning to the user that it was not possible to reliably infer a version. .. _matching-endpoints: Matching Endpoints ================== If a multiple version document exists but the discovery algorithm has chosen to fall back to the endpoint provided by the catalog, a URL matching the catalog URL should be found so that the version can be extracted. #. Get the curently scoped ``project_id`` from the token, if one exists. #. If the current catalog endpoint ends with the ``project_id``, save the ``project_id`` for later. #. Sort the endpoints in the discovery document by version in descending order. Then, for each endpoint in that list, expand the endpoint (see :ref:`expanding-endpoints`) and compare to the catalog endpoint. The first endpoint that matches is the winner. .. _expanding-endpoints: Expanding Endpoints =================== Endpoints in discovery documents can be relative and can also be erroneous in known ways. Before using endpoints from discovery documents, they must be expanded. The algorithm is as follows: #. If the endpoint from the discovery document is relative, join it with the endpoint that the discovery document was fetched from. ``six.moves.urllib.parse.urljoin`` does the right thing and can be used unconditionally. #. Replace the ``scheme`` of the endpoint from the discovery document with the ``scheme`` from the endpoint it was fetched from. This is because some services have buggy discovery documents that return incorrect schemes. For example: .. code-block:: python def replace_scheme(endpoint, discovery_url): parsed_endpoint = urllib.parse.urlparse(endpoint) parsed_discovery_url = urllib.parse.urlparse(discovery_url) return urllib.parse.ParseResult( parsed_discovery_url.scheme, parsed_endpoint.netloc, parsed_endpoint.path, parsed_endpoint.params, parsed_endpoint.query, parsed_endpoint.fragment).geturl() #. If a ``project_id`` has previously been saved, either from finding the document or as part of matching endpoints, append it to the end of the endpoint. .. _single-or-multiple: Single or Multiple Version Documents ==================================== There are three forms of version discovery documents in the wild, two that contain lists of endpoint versions and one that is for a single version. In order to apply the discovery algorithm, the type of document must be detected. #. If the document has a top level key of ``versions``, it is a multiple version document. #. If the document has a top level key of ``version``, it is a single version document. #. If the document has neither but is a single dict that contains a key of ``id``, it is a single version document. .. _normalize-document: Normalizing Documents ===================== There exist several forms of discovery documents in the wild, and there exists an `API WG document`_ about the desired state of the documents. In order to apply the other algorithms sanely, the fetched documents should be normalized to align with the `API WG document`_. #. If the document has a key named ``versions`` which contains a dict with a key named ``values``, move the list contained in values to be directly under ``versions``. That list is then the list of Version objects. #. If the document has a key named ``version``, that is the Version object. For each Version object: #. Convert the value in the ``status`` field to upper case. #. If ``status`` is ``STABLE``, change it to ``CURRENT``. (handles keystone) #. If there is a ``version`` field and not a ``min_version`` field, make a ``min_version`` field with the value from the ``version`` field. (handles nova microversions) #. Keys other than ``id``, ``min_version``, ``max_version``, ``status`` and ``links`` can be ignored or removed. #. The ``links`` key should contain a list, and that list should contain one dict with ``rel`` equal to ``self``. Any other entries can be discarded. .. _API WG document: https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/api-wg/guidelines/microversion_specification.html#version-discovery ",,229,0

we need to support microversions. In order to support microversions, we

This is a tool to automate the generation of our sample environment
files.  It takes a yaml file as input, and based on the environments
defined in that file generates a number of sample environment files
from the parameters in the Heat templates.  A tox genconfig target
is added that mirrors how the other OpenStack services generate
their sample config files.

A description of the available options for the input file is
provided in a README file in the sample-env-generator directory.

In this commit only a single sample config is provided as a basic
example of how the tool works, but subsequent commits will add
more generated sample configs.

By default, there is no supporting configuration in Ceilometer
to handle CPU monitors provided by the Nova compute_monitors
driver (cpu.virt_driver in this case).

Added metric defitions provided by cpu.virt_driver to
ceilometer/dispatcher/data/gnocchi_resources.yaml under a new
resource type, nova_compute. This enables these metrics to be

Added create_resource_type operation to gnocchi_client

This patch adds the `galera_disable_privatedevices` variable that
allows deployers to disable PrivateDevices in the systemd unit file
shipped with MariaDB 10.1+ on CentOS 7 systems.

This is a workaround to fix the systemd/LXC issues with bind
mounting an already bind mounted `/dev/ptmx` inside the LXC
container.

See Launchpad bug, lxc/lxc#1623, or systemd/systemd#6121 for more
details.

The building of the group ""repo_masters"" relies on going through
the inventory, but we never check if the hosts are added in a
particular order. While it should follow the ansible inventory
order (that's the play order by default), the inclusion of the
host to a group could happen at any time, because the play runs
all the hosts in parallel.

If we ensure the hosts are run serially, the addition of the
hosts to the architecture dependant repo_ groups will always
be done in the right order.

We can then use these groups to find which host is the first one,
and use it as ""repo_master"".

When l3 agent node is rebooted, if HA network port status is already
ACTIVE in DB, agent will get this status from server and then spawn
the keepalived (though l2 agent might not have wired the port),
resulting in multiple HA masters active at the same time.

To fix this, when the L3 agent starts up we can have it explicitly
set the port status to DOWN for all of the HA ports on that node.
Then we are guaranteed that when they go to ACTIVE it will be because
the L2 agent has wired the ports.

The building of the group ""repo_masters"" relies on going through
the inventory, but we never check if the hosts are added in a
particular order. While it should follow the ansible inventory
order (that's the play order by default), the inclusion of the
host to a group could happen at any time, because the play runs
all the hosts in parallel.

If we ensure the hosts are run serially, the addition of the
hosts to the architecture dependant repo_ groups will always
be done in the right order.

We can then use these groups to find which host is the first one,
and use it as ""repo_master"".

Recenly pylint version was bumped to 1.7.1 in global-requirements.txt.
Pylint 1.7.1 adds more checks and breaks the neutron pep8 job.

This commit adds new checks to the disabled list to avoid the gate
breakage. Individual disabled tests can be fixed later.

The new disabled list is compatible with pylint 1.4.5,
so we can merge this regardless of pylint bump is reverted or not.

disk_available_least is a free disk size information of hypervisors.
This is calculated by the following fomula:

disk_available_least = <free disk size> - <Total gap between virtual
disk size and actual disk size for all instances>

But stopped instance's virtual disk sizes were not calculated
after merging following patch in Juno cycle:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/105127

So disk_available_least might be larger than actual free disk size.
As a result, instances might be scheduled beyond the actual free
disk size if stopped instances were on a host.

This patch fix it.
Stopped instance's disks will be calculated after merging this patch.

This patch adds the `galera_disable_privatedevices` variable that
allows deployers to disable PrivateDevices in the systemd unit file
shipped with MariaDB 10.1+ on CentOS 7 systems.

This is a workaround to fix the systemd/LXC issues with bind
mounting an already bind mounted `/dev/ptmx` inside the LXC
container.

See Launchpad bug, lxc/lxc#1623, or systemd/systemd#6121 for more
details.

file_path is implicitly required if file dispatcher is enabled,
because if it is not set, no data will be record, and user get no
message from neither option help string nor log.

This patch logs a warning message for user in such scenario.

Another solution is raise an exception then the file dispatcher
will not be loaded, but considering this dispatcher is not for

1. Issue with roles of 'sahara_grenade' user (added workaround to the
keystone problem)
2. Redundant services are no longer enabled in settings, correct

3. Since there is an issue with deletion of floatings in master of heat,
so replaced cluster deletion into ocata's branch step. We should
replaced that back once it's fixed in heat.

The building of the group ""repo_masters"" relies on going through
the inventory, but we never check if the hosts are added in a

order (that's the play order by default), the inclusion of the
host to a group could happen at any time, because the play runs

If we ensure the hosts are run serially, the addition of the

be done in the right order.

We can then use these groups to find which host is the first one,

Since assertEmpty() function has already been implemented in tempest,
let's use this function instead of generic assertEqual() function.
This change makes the code and the error messages to be more readable.
Therefore it improves maintainability a little bit.

In the Tricircle, each OpenStack instance runs its own Nova and Neutron services but shares the same Keystone service or uses federated Keystone, which is a multi-region deployment mode. With networking automation, networks or ports booted in different OpenStack instances should be associated with Qos policies via layer2 network. Proposal ======== For providing Qos services to OpenStack instances, we should carry out the corresponding network deployment based on the tenants' need. When tenant build Qos and some limit rules in the Tricircle, we can not directly to create local Qos server throuth local Nertron serer in bottom pod, since the necessity of these Qos services are not clear. Perhaps these Qos services just be ready for associating. The Tricircle central Neutron plugin(abbr: ""central plugin"") will send Qos information to the Tricircle local Neutron plugin(abbr: ""local plugin"") only when the tenants need to associate the created policy with some existing local neutron networks/ports in bottom pod. The local Qos service will be created in the correspoding pod through local plugin. At the same time, central plugin copies the correspoding Qos rule to the local plugin. The following graph shows the relation between tenant and centrol Neutron and local Neutron servers:: +------+ |tenant| +-+--+-+ | | +----------------+ +-------------------------+ | create associate network or | |Qos and rule port with Qos | | | | xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx | | xxx xxx | | xx xx | +-------+ xxx +----------+ xxx | | x | | x | | x | | x | v V | v V v +--------+-----------+ | +----+----------+---+ | central Neutron | | | local Neutron | | +----------------+ | | | +---------------+ | | | central plugin | | | | | locall plugin | | | +----------------+ | | | +---------------+ | +--------------------+ | +-------------------+ | | +---------------+ Implememtation ============== Next using Qos service and associate working procedure to elaborate how Qos works in the Tricircle. To begin with, tenant first creates Qos and its limit rule via central Neutron server. However, bottom pod does not necessarily require the created policy. When the tenants first need to associate the created policy with some existing local neutron port or networks in bottom pod, central plugin will send associate request to local plugin. Then, this tenant passes the Qos id as the requested network information to local Nova server to associate networks or ports. During parameter validation, local Neutron server queries this Qos id to ensure the passed-in Qos id is valid, which is a ""Qos-get"" request. In the ""Qos-get"" handle function, local plugin first checks if local Neutron already has a Qos with that id. If not, local plugin need to retrieve Qos information from central Neutron server for Qos creating. Tenant may pass an invalid Qos id by mistake, in this case, local plugin will receive a 404 response from central Neutron server, it just returns a 404 response to local Nova server. At the same time, central plugin send the routing creation request to the Tricircle database for routing creating. Xjob receives and process Qos async jobs from central plugin, then call the local plugin to create Qos and limit rule. Ensure Qos service could be created in async way. Here is the proposed flow:: +--------+ +---------+ +---------+ +-----------+ +----------+ | | | | | | | | | | | Tenant | | Central | | Xjob | | Database | | Local | | | | plugin | | | | | | plugin | | | | | | | | | | | +---+----+ +----+----+ +----+----+ +-----+-----+ +----+-----+ | | | | | | First call Qos | | | | | creation API | | | | +------------------> | | | | | | | | | First call Qos | | | | | rule creation API| | | | +------------------> | | | | | | | | | First bind port | | | | | or network with | | | | | Qos | | | | +------------------> | | | | | | | | | | Bind port/network with Qos | | +-------------------------------------------------------> | | | | | | | Get Qos information | | <-------------------------------------------------------- | | | | | | | Return Qos information | | +-------------------------------------------------------> | | | | | | | Create Qos routing | | | +--------------------------------------> | | | | | | | | Create Xjob for | | | | | Qos rule | | | | +-------------------> | | | | | Create Qos rule | | | +-----------------------------------> | | | | | | Second call Qos | | | | | rule creation API| | | | | and bind port | | | | | or network with | | | | | Qos | | | | +------------------> | | | | | | | | | | Get Qos routing | | | +--------------------------------------> | | | Return Qos routing | | | <--------------------------------------| | | | | | | | | | Create Qos rule | | | +-------------------------------------------------------> | | | | | | | | | | + + + + + After the Qos routing information created in the Tricircle database, when the tenant need to use the same Qos and create a new limit rule for networks/ports in the same bottom pod. Central plugin directly get the Qos routing information from the Tricircle database and tell local plugin to create the new Qos rule. Local Neutron server directly associates the requested networks/ports with Qos and use the new limit rule.

Currently the timeout values for client/connect/server are hard coded
in templates/haproxy.cfg.j2. In order to give users flexibility to

I replaced hard coded timeout values with variables.

The original default values are still kept in defaults/main.yml.

In newton, we used to construct the fqdn_$NETWORK in puppet-tripleo for
external, internal_api, storage, storage_mgmt, tenant, management, and
ctrlplane. When this was moved into THT, we accidently dropped external
which leads to deployment failures if a service is moved to the external
network and the configuration consumes the fqdn_external hiera key.
Specifically this is reproduced if the MysqlNetwork is switch to to
exernal, then the deployment fails because the bind address which is set
to use fqdn_external is blank.

assertFalse(None) passes, but assertEqual(False, None) will fail.
Therefore, this patch weakened our tests.

The ``nova-compute`` service takes multiple parameters like ``NovaVcpuPinSet``, ``NovaReservedHostMemory``, etc. It is possible to provide separate values specific to a role with the following changes in the user environment file:: parameter_defaults: NovaReservedHostMemory: 512 ComputeRole1Parameters: NovaReservedHostMemory: 2048 ComputeRole2Parameter: NovaReservedHostMemory: 1024 The format to provide role-specific parameters is ``<RoleName>Parameters``, where the ``RoleName`` is the name of the role as defined in the ``roles_data.yaml`` template. In the above specified example, the value ""512"" will be applied all the roles which has the ``nova-compute`` service, where as the value ""2048"" will be applied only on the **ComputeRole1** role and the value ""1024"" will be applied only on the **ComputeRole2** role. With this approach, the service implementation has to merge the role-specific parameters with the global parameters in their definition template. The role- specific parameter takes higher precedence than the global parameters. For any custom service which need to use role-specific parameter, the parameter merging should be done. Here is a sample parameter merging example which will be done by the service implementation:: RoleParmaetersValue: type: OS::Heat::Value properties: type: json value: map_replace: - map_replace: - neutron::agents::ml2::ovs::datapath_type: NeutronDatapathType neutron::agents::ml2::ovs::vhostuser_socket_dir: NeutronVhostuserSocketDir vswitch::dpdk::driver_type: NeutronDpdkDriverType vswitch::dpdk::host_core_list: HostCpusList vswitch::dpdk::pmd_core_list: NeutronDpdkCoreList vswitch::dpdk::memory_channels: NeutronDpdkMemoryChannels vswitch::dpdk::socket_mem: NeutronDpdkSocketMemory - values: {get_param: [RoleParameters]} - values: 'NeutronDatapathType': {get_param: NeutronDatapathType} 'NeutronVhostuserSocketDir': {get_param: NeutronVhostuserSocketDir} 'NeutronDpdkDriverType': {get_param: NeutronDpdkDriverType} 'HostCpusList': {get_param: HostCpusList} 'NeutronDpdkCoreList': {get_param: NeutronDpdkCoreList} 'NeutronDpdkMemoryChannels': {get_param: NeutronDpdkMemoryChannels} 'NeutronDpdkSocketMemory': {get_param: NeutronDpdkSocketMemory} .. note:: As of now, not all parameters support role-specific, it is based on the service or template implementation.

Currently TCMalloc's default tc size is 32MB.
This causes poor performance in ceph storage.
A new ceph_tcmalloc_tc_bytes option has been added
with a default of 128MB.

128 MB is default TC size at above jewel version.
and if we don't set this config,

because 32MB is default size in TCmalloc 2.4 version.

The commit with change id [1], added the pacemaker HA support
for OVN DB servers. That commit created a new VIP which is
really not required.

This patch removes the code to create a new ip resource. Instead
it expects the pacemaker ip resource (with the ip address in the
'ovn_dbs_vip' parameter and with the name ""ip-$ovn_dbs_vip"") to be
created before ovn_northd class is called, which is the case anyway
if 'ovn_dbs_vip' is taken from the ServiceNetMapDefaults (in t-h-t).

This patch implements a dhcp-proxy-service within the networking-odl v2
driver framework.  At the core of this patch is the business logic to
create DHCP Neutron ports specifically for use by OpenDaylight's DHCP
Service (these DHCP Neutron ports will be different from DHCP ports
allocated by stock Neutron-DHCP-Agent).
As a result this patch enables OpenDaylight Controller deployments to
provide DHCP services using the DHCP Neutron Ports handcrafted by this
patch.

tenant_quota_usage() is used to retrieve quota and usage
to determine if a resource can be created.
However, tenant_quota_usage retrieves quota and usage for
all resources and it can be a performance problem.

This commit allows to load quota and usage only for resources

This patch drops the --install-kolla option from the

Installing packages via Yum in quickstart or tripleo.sh should be just fine

Previously, the API service created port objects without hitting the
conductor. This change moves port creation to the conductor service,
adding a create_port method.

Currently this just performs the port object creation but in a future
change this will be used to validate the physical network assignment of
ports in a portgroup when a port is created, ensuring that all ports in
the group have the same physical network.

The conductor RPC API version has been bumped to 1.41.

Previously the libvirt driver would always assume that it was only
detaching devices (volumes or virtual interfaces) from a persistent
domain however that is not always the case.

For example when rolling back from a live migration an attempt is made
to detach volumes from the transient destination domain that is being
cleaned up. This attempt would fail with the previous assumption of the
domain being persistent in place.

This change introduces a simple call to has_persistent_configuration
within detach_device_with_retry to confirm the state of the domain
before attempting to detach.

This specification doesn't attempt to describe all steps and measures that need to be taken in order to achieve these goals. It rather aims to set a common ground for understanding what tasks and challenges the team needs to solve and proposes approximate approaches for that. Problem description =================== In a nutshell, being highly available and scalable means that we should be able to run more than one Mistral cluster component of any type (api, engine, executor) and gain more reliability and performance. Originally, Mistral was designed to be fully asynchronous and thus easily scalable, so we know that Mistral, in fact, works with multiple APIs, engines and executors and its performance becomes higher in this case. High availability though is a complex non functional requirement that is usually achieved by making lots of changes to account for various failure situations that can happen with multiple nodes of the systems. Particularly, the system should gracefully handle cluster topology changes: node addition and node departure. These events should not affect normal work of workflows that have already been started. So far, Mistral team hasn't spent significant focused on HA. Although Mistral partially implements these two non functional requirements we need to make sure that all of their corresponding aspects are implemented tested. This specification aims to clearly define these aspects and roughly propose approaches for taking care of them. Use Cases --------- * Scalability is needed when performance of a Mistral cluster component, such as Mistral engine, limited by resources (I/O, RAM, CPU) of a single machine, is not sufficient. Those are any use cases that assume significant load on Mistral, essentially lots of tasks processed by Mistral per time unit. Example: hosted workflow service in a public cloud. * High availability is critically important for use cases where workflows managed by Mistral should live even in case of infrastructure failures. To deal with these failures the system needs to have redundancy, i.e. extra instances of cluster components. Losing part of them doesn't affect normal work of the system, all functionality continues to be accessible. Proposed change =============== **Testing infrastructure** Currently, Mistral team doesn't have any infrastructure that would allow to automate testing of multi-node Mistral, whether we want to test scalability properties or reliability and availability. The first step towards achieving the goals defined by the spec is to create such an infrastructure. Currently, the requirements for this infrastructure are seen as follows: * New gate in OpenStack CI that will allow to run any number of Mistral cluster components as separate processes * Python utility methods that will allow to start, stop and find running Mistral cluster components. This is required because we should be able to have different number of cluster components for different tests within the same gate. It will also allow to test addition and departure of cluster nodes (scale up and down). * Means that will allow to imitate infrastructure failures. One of the most important is lost messages in RPC. * A tool for benchmarking Mistral performance when it's installed in multi-node mode. Ideally, it needs to be a separate gate (most likely based on Rally) **Mistral stable multi-node topology** This work item mostly assumes testing Mistral with multiple nodes when the number of node is stable. The most important part is to test multiple engines because engine is the part of the system that creates complex database transactions and there used to be known issues related to that like deadlocks. These known issues seem to have been fixed but we need to create test harness for this and make sure it's tested automatically on every commit. Potentially, we might still have some issues like that. **Mistral variable multi-node topology (scale up/down)** Once multi-node Mistral is tested with a stable cluster topology we need to make sure to create tests where nodes are added and removed while workflows are running. These workflows must finish successfully regardless of cluster topology changes, only if there's at least one running component of every type (engine, executor, api). In this part we expect issues related to lost RPC messages for communications where message acknowledgements are not used. It's possible that component A will send a message component B, and if component B polls the message from a message queue and goes down before the message is fully processed and result is sent back, then state of a corresponding object in the database won't be updated (action execution, task execution, workflow execution). Having that said, as of now, there's no opportunity to fix this when using oslo.messaging based RPC implementation because it doesn't support message acknowledgement needed for the ""Work queue"" pattern, i.e. ""at-least-once"" delivery. See https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python.html for details. For now, we have to use Kombu-based Mistral RPC which supports this mechanism. However, it's know that message acknowledgements are enabled not for all needed communications. For example, it is enabled on the executor side so that a message sent to an executor (to run an action) is acknowledged after it's fully processed. But it's known that it's not enabled on the engine side when, for example, executor sends a result of the action back to Mistral. Part of this work item will be identifying all such gaps in the Mistral communication protocol and fix them. Another visible problem is graceful scale down, when the node that is intentionally leaving cluster topology should stop handling new incoming RPC requests but complete requests that are already being processed. If this concern is not taken care of, we'll be getting repeated message processing problem, i.e. when in fact a message was processed more than once that in turn leads to breaking normal logic of workflow processing. The example: an engine sends a ""run action"" request to an executor, executor polls it, runs an action and immediately after that goes down w/o having a chance to send the result back to the engine acknowledging the initial message. So, in fact, the acton already ran once. Then, since the message is not acknowledged, a message queue broker will resend it to a different executor and it'll be processed again. The solution: graceful shutdown when executor fully processes the message, sends the result back, acknowledges the message and only then is allowed to shut down. **Handling failures** TODO **Known RPC issues** TODO Alternatives ------------ None. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. End user impact --------------- Higher uptime of Mistral service (if by end user we mean those who call Mistral API). Performance Impact ------------------ * Performance of Mistral with more nodes will be higher than performance of Mistral with less nodes. Deployer impact --------------- Deployers will be able to run more Mistral nodes to increase performance and redundancy/availability of the service. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: rakhmerov Other contributors: melisha Work Items ---------- TODO: * OpenStack CI job for testing Mistral in HA * Create a test suite to check that Mistral works correctly with multiple cluster nodes when number of nodes is not changing and there's no failures in infrastructure * Create a test suite for Mistral cluster scale up and scale down * Create a test suite to check Mistral fault tolerance * Create a set of automatic benchmarks (most likely with Rally) that will show how Mistral cluster scale up / scale down influence performance * Fix issues found during testing * Fix known RPC communication issues (acknowledgements etc.) Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= * Use a new CI gate that will allow to run multiple cluster nodes and test how Mistral scales up and down and how it reacts on various infrastructure failures (more details above) References ========== None.

Currently, plug_vifs is called when powering on the instance.
The call to wait_for_plug_events will give a timeout waiting
for the plug event when using neutron-ovs-agent.

This patch addresses this issue by moving the call to plug_vifs
from power_on to after the create_instance call, which is prior
to waiting for plug events. This change modifies the behaviour
of power_on only during the instance spawn, the other calls
remaining the same.

libffi-dev is required to install cffi and PyNaCL from tarballs.
cffi is installed from requirements.txt, so 'test' profile is not

We usual use wheel packages when installing python packages,

This patch enables operators to configure read/write affinity per
policy.

Prior to this change, the affinity settings in proxy-server.conf were
applied globally. However, depending on how region and zone settings are
defined in each policy ring, defining a global read/write affinity is
not ideal for the cluster. With this change, operators have the choice to
set the affinity option at the policy level.

e.g.
policy-0 -> r1 and r2
policy-1 -> r3

This patch introduces the suffix format, ""_policy_N"" for both write_affinity
and read_affinity. The existing setting write_affinity and read_affinity are
still used as the default and operators can override the default value via
write_affinity_policy_N or read_affinity_policy_N options in the
proxy-server.conf

For develpers:
- swift.common.utils.affinity_locality_predicate always returns
  single-argument function
- swift.proxy.server.sort_nodes requires policy as an arg which can be
  None if it's unnecessary (e.g. GET account/container)

Launchpad Blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/python-karborclient/+spec/karbor-support-python-openstackclient Problem Description =================== python-openstackclient is becoming the default command line client for many OpenStack projects. Karbor would benefit from implementing all of its client commands as a single python-openstackclient plugin implemented in the python-karborclient repository. Proposed Change =============== The intent of this spec is to identify the commands to be implemented and establish conventions for command and argument names. This spec is not intended to be a full and correct specification of command and argument names. The details can be left to the code reviews for the commands themselves. The following conventions will be adopted for command names: * As the ``OpenStackClient`` convention, the command name shall always take the following form: .. code-block:: bash openstack [<global-options>] <object-1> <action> [<object-2>] \ [command-arguments] As a example: The following ``karbor`` commands about plan will be implemented for ``openstack`` initially suggesting these command names: .. code-block:: bash karbor plan-create <name> <provider_id> <resources> openstack dataprotection plan create <name> <provider_id> <resources> karbor plan-delete <plan> openstack dataprotection plan delete <plan> karbor plan-list openstack dataprotection plan list karbor plan-show <plan> openstack dataprotection backup plan <backup> karbor plan-update <name> <resources> <status> openstack dataprotection plan update <name> <resources> <status> Configuration ------------- None Database -------- None Public API ---------- None Public API Security ------------------- None Python API ---------- None CLI (python-karborclient) ------------------------ A new directory named osc will be created under /karborclient/osc for the ``OpenStackClient`` plugin and the commands mentioned above.

Change Idcbada705c1d38ac5fd7c600141c2de7020eae25 in Ocata
started preferring Cinder connection info for getting RBD auth
values since Nova needs to be using the same settings as Cinder
for volume auth.

However, that introduced a problem for guest connections made
before that change, where the secret_uuid might not have been
configured on the Cinder side and that's what is stored in the
block_device_mappings.connection_info column and is what we're
checking in _set_auth_config_rbd. Before Ocata this wasn't a
problem because we'd use the Nova configuration values for the
rbd_secret_uuid if set. But since Ocata it is a problem since
we don't consult nova.conf if auth was enabled, but not completely
configured, on the Cinder side.

So this adds a fallback check to set the secret_uuid from
nova.conf if it wasn't set in the connection_info via Cinder
originally. A note is also added to caution about removing
any fallback mechanism on the nova side - something we'd
need to consider before we could likely drop this code.

Virtuozzo containers based on OS-level virtualization.
OS containers don't use swap as additional disk.
So Virtuozzo doesn't support swap in terms of OpenStack.
We should fail ""nova boot"" operation if
user try to create Virtuozzo container which is based on flavor with swap disk.

In this patch we move the code which checks swap disk
to the beginning of the function.
We should check swap disk before creating ephemeral and root disk, because
in case of error we don't need to delete created disks.

Devices are placed into failure domains consistingsystems characterized by lower bandwidth or higher latency between machines inWhen building a ring, replicas for each part will be assigned to devices according to the devices' weights. Additionally, each replica of a part will preferentially be assigned to a device whose failure domain does not already have a replica for that part.

For example: ``sdb1``.. note:: The list of devices may contain holes, or indexes set to ``None``, for devices that have been removed from the cluster. However, device ids are reused. Device ids are reused to avoid potentially running out of device id slots when there are available slots (from prior removal of devices). A consequence of this device id reuse is that the device id (integer value) does not necessarily correspond with the chronology of when the device was added to the ring. Also, some devices may be temporarily disabled by setting their weight to ``0.0``.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================= alarm deduction ============================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/vitrage/+spec/alarm-deduction Vitrage should support alarm deduction. This feature will allow us to get the deduced alarm that are not reported as expected (lost or delayed). Problem description =================== There is a known fault model: alarm A causes an alarm B. When alarm A is reported, we hope we can deduced the alarm B at once, even if alarm B is delayed or could not be reported due to some reason(network problem, physical error and etc). Proposed change =============== We could identify the raised alarm B by vitrage and the reported alarm B by other datasource as the same alarm. In other words, we could merge the two alarms. We could just replace the vitrage raised alarm to datasource reported alarm. 1. Templates should specify the datasource type when the action is ""raise-alarm""(Default type is vitrage). 2. Alarms from evaluator_queue should be added the ``is_deduced`` property, and a new transformer may be needed. 3. Alarms from mp_queue should first check if the vertex exists in the graph. If yes just repalce the vertex. Otherwise, continue the original process. 4. If Alarm A is recovered, then alarm B is deduced to be recovered too. If alarm B recovered message is received later, just discard the message. Alternatives ------------ None. Data model impact ----------------- There would some impact on performance, because evaluator process may execute twice. REST API impact --------------- None Versioning impact ----------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- 1. Templates should specify the datasource type when the action is ""raise-alarm""(Default type is vitrage).

The ring up- and downloading was never executed if run within a
containerized environment. This is due to the fact that this manifest
gets executed within step 6(5) only. There is also an ordering issue,
which actually tries to create the tarballs before rebalancing.

This patch fixes the step conditions and also chains the tarball
creation to the rebalance.

The check to query rings on all nodes can now be disabled. This is
required on containerized environments: the local ring will be modified
and rebalanced, but rings on the existing servers are not yet modified.
Therefore a recon-check will fail, and needs to be disabled.

an EndpointData for each v2 endpoint_type found with url and interface
set properly.

This normalizes into v3 format so that the construction and be
straightforward, and introduces a denormalize used in the
ServiceCatalogV2 to re-combine the entries into the format expected by
V2 users of get_endpoints().

In composable HA we bind resources to nodes that have special

Under normal conditions with the recommended deployment a proxy server will first attempt to read fragments from nodes in its local region, which are guaranteed to be unique with respect to each other. Even if their are a small amount of local failures, unique local parity fragments can make up the difference. However, should enough local primary storage fail, such that a normal un-duplicated read would be unavailable, a global EC cluster will proceed to read fragments from the other region(s). However, because random reads from the remote region are not guaranteed to be unique - there is a significantly high probability the proxy will encounter a duplicate fragment and have make additional requests - potentially as many as the total available fragments or more until the handoffs locations in the local and remote region have been exhaustively searched before failing the read. A global EC deployment configured as recommended will be extremely resilient. However, random reads from the remote region under extreme failure will also be inefficient because nodes in other regions are guaranteed to have some fragments which are duplicates of those the proxy server has already received. If the proxy encounters such responses it will ignore it and issue yet more requests to nodes in other regions.

Generally with nested stacks, when validating the parent stack we don't
validate the property *values* in the nested stack as we recurse down (i.e.
the strict_validate flag is set to False on the nested stack). We validate
the values when we come to actually create the nested stack.

ResourceChain is an exception - the line of code to do this was commented
out without explanation during initial development of the resource. This
has two consequences:

* Resources in the child stack always have their property values validated
  during the validation of the root stack, as well as when the child stack
  is created. (Property values should be examined only in the latter
  validation pass).
* Since ea2673fb9a04588e0e294d159945d075657b9112, any grandchild stacks
  (i.e. where a member of the ResourceChain is itself a StackResource of
  type) will not be validated at all during the validation of the root
  stack. (They should be still validated, though property values will not
  be examined.)

This change makes ResourceChain behave like other StackResources.

Dashboard configurations are applied through Horizon's local_settings.py file. 3. Hiding health check info --------------------------- Sahara UI panels normally contain some information about cluster health. If the relevant functionality has been disabled in the Sahara service, then operators may prefer to not have any references to health at all in the UI, since there would not be any usable health information in that case. The visibility of health check info can be toggled via the ``SAHARA_VERIFICATION_DISABLED`` parameter, whose default value is False, meaning that the health check info will be visible. Example: .. sourcecode:: python SAHARA_VERIFICATION_DISABLED = True ..",Sahara UI panels are integrated into the OpenStack Dashboard repository. No additional steps are required to enable Sahara UI in OpenStack Dashboard. However there are a few configurations that should be made to configure OpenStack Dashboard.

When l3 agent node is rebooted, if HA network port status is already
ACTIVE in DB, agent will get this status from server and then spawn
the keepalived (though l2 agent might not have wired the port),
resulting in multiple HA masters active at the same time.

To fix this, when the L3 agent starts up we can have it explicitly
set the port status to DOWN for all of the HA ports on that node.
Then we are guaranteed that when they go to ACTIVE it will be because
the L2 agent has wired the ports.

The exception message for InvalidSharedStorage is grammatically
complex and ignores the possibility of block migration, which
results in a misleading and confusing message for the user.

Change it to something simpler and more accurate.

test_volumes_snapshots_rbac frequently throws a BadRequest
during cleanup with the following message: Invalid snapshot:
Snapshot status must be available or error and must not be part of
a group.

This fix adds waiters to certain snapshot operations so that
cleanup is not attempted while this snapshots are in a state
that would cause this BadRequest error to be thrown.

There are a number of fixtures still present in test_discovery for
testing that version discovery works with the different discovery pages
found in glance, cinder and others.

The method names for a lot of this stuff was slightly changed from
keystoneclient to keystoneauth so it looks like these tests were dropped
in the port rather than fixed.

Re-add these tests to ensure other discovery formats are supported.

This patch adds the QoS panel which displays Neutron QoS policies.
This patch allows read only view of the policies, displaying the name,
id, description and shared status of each policy. Policy actions and
rules to be added in follow-up patches.

To test:
Neutron's QoS plugin must be enabled in your setup.
To enable the QoS plugin in devstack please add the following lines
in the local.conf

    enable_plugin neutron git://git.openstack.org/openstack/neutron
    enable_service q-qos

and rebuild your stack (./stack.sh).

Create some qos policies via CLI (neutron qos-policy-create policy1).
now you can list the policies using this patch.

Removing the requirement for a hardware RAID controller by implementing software RAID on compute nodes reduces initial hardware costs but retains some resiliency, allowing a good ""trade-off"" between cost and features. It would be useful to be able to do this to add resiliency for compute nodes for example. Problem description =================== Typically controller hardware will have a RAID card so we don't need to worry about these. Compute nodes however can be fitted with multiple disks to allow some fault tolerance. Hardware RAID controllers can be expensive so if we can deploy software RAID with LVM, this is a good thing. We can then monitor this for disk failures and, if the deployment is a hypervisor, we can live-migrate instances to other nodes prior to performing maintenance. Proposed change =============== The default hardware manager in ironic-python-agent should be expanded to include support for LVM. This should involve calling lvm utilities to create an LV. Building LVM RAID will be run as a clean step, and this will be run every time after wiping the hard drive. Alternatives ------------ Can we modify the deployment image to deploy on LVM? I suspect not.

When global_environment_variables is set in user_variables.yml, this
installs environment settings in /etc/environment on all hosts and
containers. These remain in place after deployment is complete.

This patch adds a similar variable deployment_environment_variables
that defines environment strings applied only while the playbooks
are running. They leave nothing behind on the hosts or containers.

This may be used, for example, for proxy settings required only
during deployment. A simpler no_proxy setting is adequate during
deployment, so this provides a workaround to Bug #1691749.

   tags are implemented which are intended to provide
   a clear code path for each of them.
5. Log output is added to the venv build process to make
   troubleshooting easier.
6. The stdout output for the wheel and venv build
   processes is made minimal to reduce confusion and
   make it easier to spot which item failed to build.
   The log output in /var/log/repo contains the verbose
   output from pip.

This patch makes the ""Select Boot Source"" dropdown in the Source step of
the new Launch Instance have a deterministic order.

The slight downside to this is that the order needs to be recalculated
as new possible boot sources are loaded. However, given that this is the
second step of the workflow, this is unlikely to ever be noticed by a
user.

When merging project_values and user_values after taking the symmetric
difference of their keys, we should use a default value of 0 for the
.get(key) calls because a default value of None will not take
precedence over 0 if 0 is the value in project_values or user_values.

If enforce_ssl is set to true in openstack-dashboard, a user is
redirected to the IP address of the server, not its hostname.

This boils down to the template used to construct the site, which
is always fed an IP address by horizon_context.py.

Instead of using an IP address, use the result of resolve_address.

The marker for paging over hypervisors (compute nodes) is the
integer id field (compute_nodes.id column). This corrects the
type in the API reference parameters.

Since assertEmpty() function has already been implemented,
let's use this function instead of generic assertEqual() function.
This change makes the code and the error messages to be more readable.
Therefore it improves maintainability a little bit.

Part of the original framework has been changed to allow the new framework to handle jobs, but maintaining backwards compatibility with the original framework while jobs are being transitioned TOCI entry point ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Upon starting a job, based on the configuration of its layout, zuul will call devstack-gate, which is needed for the basic nodepool node setup, but will then pass the control to ``toci_gate_test.sh``. During the transition, this will be a symbolic link to ``toci_gate_test-oooq.sh``. Quickstart Transition scripts ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The initial part of ``toci_gate_test-oooq.sh`` script decides whether to exec the original workflow or continue with the quickstart workflow, based on the job type passed down by zuul layout parameters. To move a job to the new quickstart framework, it is enough to propose a change to zuul layout to add a ""featureset"" keyword on its type. When using the quickstart workflow, the rest of the script will assemble a set of arguments to pass to quickstart scripts, based on the components of the job type separated by dashes e.g. a job type value of ""periodic-ovb-featureset001"" will make the script assemble arguments to deal with ""ovb"" provisioning, and set featurset001 to be the test matrix for the job. This script will also invoke the test environment broker to create the proper ovb environment. At the end the ``toci_gate_test-oooq.sh`` will pass control to ``toci_quickstart.sh`` script that will actually call quickstart with its parameters. Quickstart Framework ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ``toci_quickstart.sh`` consists of three parts, setup, invocationo and logs collection. For more information about feature sets and test matrix please see .. _Featureset Documentation: https://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-quickstart/feature-configuration.html from quickstart documentation The new workflow uses the directory toci-quickstart/ to store TripleO ci specific configurations, roles or playbooks for the quickstart workflow The parts of quickstart under scripts/ are instead handled by the original framework only Original Framework ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Job parameters are configured in ``toci_gate_test-orig.sh``.

Now that ironic-lib builds IPA from source, the IPA building procedure
needs to support requirements referring to /opt/stack/new.

As upper-constraints are not actually needed in the finalise step, they're
no longer used there to avoid dealing with file:/// references. We also
allow pre-release packages to be installed by pip.

Also install git as it's a build requirement for PBR.

Only tinyipa is updated, as it's used in the ironic-lib gate.

This patch is a hack and does the following:
1. Enable service user in nova, which will test validatting expired
   user tokens when service token is passed along.
2. Decrease the user token timeout to 300 seconds, so it should timeout
   fast.
3. Increase tempest build timeout to 600, so it should not bail out on
   tests before actually hitting user timeout.

Nova patch https://review.openstack.org/#/c/413232/ is be dependent
on this patch and will have actaul test results.
