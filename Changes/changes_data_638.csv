dib is now going to have to be installed explicitly for us to actually
run the gate. the old method of just cloning the repo won't work with
dib v2.

There are other ways to accomplish this but I'm choosing this approach
knowing that it isn't ideal. First, what's the downside? This means
that dib gets installed wherever trove control plane is installed. Is
that necessary, NO. Is it the end of the world, NO.

What are the options?

- do what Octavia did and have a second requirements.txt in a folder
  called diskimage-create. Would this work, yes but we don't have such
  a mechanism right now and nothing would keep this requirements.txt
  file in sync with g-r that I know of.

- hardcode the pip install command somewhere in the devstack
  plugin. yes, this would work but this would also have no ability to
  sync with g-r.

So, while the solution proposed here isn't ideal, it strikes me as not
bad, and much less risk than the other two options.

We also need to figure out where the elements are and fix the path for
disk-image-create.

Some pep8 failures appears to have crept in as well, those are
addressed.

Currently, attempting to use Trusty (14.04) VMs causes VMs to not
provision correctly due to a grub-install error.  With respect to this
specific issue, this commit updates vm.preseed.j2 by removing some
grub-installer options which were not present before the ansible
rewrite.

Secondly, with that change in place, VMs do not come online on their
10.0.236 addresses as something is overwriting
/etc/networking/interfaces, which wipes out the source of the
/etc/network/interfaces.d directory.  Bug [1] seems to indicate this
is in fact an issue and has been resolved, however attempts at using
this preseed option (netcfg/target_network_config) were not successful.
As a workaround, we simply chattr +i the interfaces file in
vm-post-install-script.sh.j2, and then remove the attr in
deploy-vms.yml when the instance is up an accessible.

The goal of this commit is to test the following projects:
- openstack/puppet-openstack-integration
- openstack/puppet-nova

These two projects, by themselves, provide a fairly comprehensive
set of jobs which represents a good sample to test the migration
results with.
Beaker jobs, puppet-openstack-integration scenarios, unit tests,
lint tests, release notes jobs, a tripleo job, etc.

Ultimately, we're talking about:
- 2 projects
- 33 jobs (and their legacy playbooks)
- 11 project templates

The generated content for these were provided verbatim by the migration
script, only two modifications were made:
1) jobs were set to non-voting
2) added required-projects since puppet-openstack jobs rely on
   ""zuul-cloning"" each other a lot.

The smoke test that ran the CLI command ""acl delete""
with a null entity_ref was failing with an exception
in the cliff library.  This test is invalid, since
the CLI parser would not accept this command without
an entity_ref.

This test failed more gracefully with cliff 2.3.0, but
in 2.4.0 cliff throws an exception that causes this
test to start failing.

This patch is needed in stable/newton to prevent gate
failures, since upper constraints are not set.

This PS fixes an AttributeError being raised in ServerActionsRbacTest
[0] due to a recent Tempest change [1]. Besides, the volume
creation was being done manually in Patrole, when the volume
should have been created using Tempest's base helper for creating
a volume.

This same issue applies with `test_create_image_volume_backed` in
the same class [2] due to a recent Tempest change [3], and besides
that, the previous way of spinning up a volume-backed server did
not leverage Tempest's helpers, which this PS corrects.

Added changes to LVM driver to support NVMe target CLI.
A new target, NVMET, is added for the LVM driver, and allows
cinder to use nvmetcli in order to create/delete subsystems
on attaching/detaching an LVM volume.

By choosing iscsi_helper as nvmet, other parameters can be configured
too in cinder.conf like nvmet_port_id, nvmet_ns_id (for namespace) and
nvmet_subsystem_name. The target IP and port, that will be used by
nvmecli OS-brick’s NVMe connector, are taken from iscsi_ip_address
and iscsi_port in cinder.conf for now.

We had previously added an element to remove the machine id from the

run as part of the image building process. This change sets
70-remove-machine-id to be executable so that /etc/machine-id will
actually be removed from the images during the building process.
Additionally this changes the element to clear the file rather than
delete it as if the file is missing, things may not work as expected.

This patch updates our doc conf.py to support the linkcheck builder in
addition to adding a new 'linkcheck' target in tox to run the builder.
Also the release checklist is updated suggesting the linkcheck tox
target be run prior to a release.

- /etc/kolla/config/global.conf

but it can be done in 3 different manners, all not documented:

- /etc/kolla/config/database.conf
- /etc/kolla/config/messaging.conf

database.conf and messaging.conf seems redundant with global.conf.
In order to simplify codebase it seems logical to remove them.

Documentation has been added for overriding configuration globally and
release note has been added too.

When the container server receives an object PUT or DELETE
and the container is sharded it will go look for the shard
to update and return a redirect.
If it fails to find a shard, then just accept it locally so
misplaced objects can deal with it later.

Currently we return a HTTPCreated which is clearly wrong as
the update hasn't actually be written anywhere.

When a memecached server goes offline in the middle of a
MemcahceRing (swift memcache client) session then a request
to memcached returns nothing and the client inside swift
leaves an ""IndexError: list index out of range"" stacktrace.

This change corrects that in all the places of MemcacheRing

Every day Rally step by step closer to the point where Rally is going to be
generic framework and it would be possible to split Rally & Rally OpenStack Plugins

One of the blockers for doing this is certification & samples directories and
their contents. Current apporach creates a lot of confusion:

- Rally Users are running samples against production
- Rally samples are actually not that usefull, because creating from them
  tasks takes a lot of time
- Rally Users don't know what certification task is and how to use it
- Samples are hard to ship/find in packaged way (when rally is installed)
- Samples are going to be impossible to ship after the split
- We have to keep hunderds of yaml/json files in actual state
  in our repo (extra work for developers)

Proposed approach is to:

- Create mechansim CLI command that generates samples using plugin names
- Rename certification -> tasks
- Put in tasks directory pre created and tested tasks for different use cases:
  key performance metrics, functional testing, load testing of key functionality,
  ha Testing
- Remove samples as they are not needed anymore

Horizon is a web application that is distributed between the web
server, and the web browser. If the web server is upgraded while
the application is still running on the web browser, unusual issues
can creep up.

This patch allows for an haproxy based frontend container to be
created that, through kolla config options, allows multiple horizon
backends to be defined, browsers to be temporarily bound to the
versions they initially landed on, and new horizons introduced for
testing and promotion to default.

This patch adds the enable-qos option to the charm. If enable-qos is
set then neutron.services.qos.qos_plugin.QoSPlugin is added to
service_plugins in neutron.conf locally. The
neutron-plugin-api-relation has also been updated to send the
enable-qos option to charms connected over that relation (for
example neutron-openvswitch and neutron-gateway).

As part of this some of the logic for setting service_plugins was
removed from the neutron.conf and placed in the NeutronCCContext.

This patch does quite a few things to improve the performance of the
CentOS tasks:

1) Configures RDO repos as repositories rather than reinstalling an
   RPM each time.
2) GPG keys are only installed if they're needed.
3) Yum repo configs are carefully modified if they already exist
   which avoids removing deployer configurations.
4) Repo priorities are now set in one shot.

Backport was adjusted to fix a merge conflict in pre_install_yum.yml.

The test_resize_server_error_and_reschedule_was_failed notifiation sample
test only waits for the instance to go to ERROR state and then asserts that
two notifications are emitted. However the second notification,
compute.exception, only emited after the instance is put into ERROR state.
This makes the test unstable.

This patch makes the test stable by waiting for the compute.exception
notification to arrive before asserting the received notifications.

For better UX ""Migration Policy"" param value is set to
""On Demand"" by default in Horizon for volume retype feature.

Volume retype will enable a user to change a volume's type after its creation.

Migrating the volume will be necessary if:
1. The volume's current host cannot handle the new type
2. The volume's driver cannot change the type

The ""Migration Policy"" is only used if the volume retype
cannot be completed. If the ""Migration Policy"" is ""On Demand"",
the back end will perform volume migration.

The mission of Blazar project[1] is to provide resource reservations
in OpenStack clouds for virtual resouces and physical resources.

Blazar ensures cloud users can deploy their resources during specific time
frames, using reservations.  Blazar creates reservations when it recieves
requests from cloud users about future usages of resources. It finds
out if the clouds can accommodate the usage requests in the reservation
time frame.  A request can define reservations of various kinds of
resources, such as virtual resources (Nova instances or Cinder volumes)
as well as physical resources (Nova hypervisor or Cinder storage).

The features of Blazar are interesting varied kind of OpenStack clouds users,
such as Scientific WGs and Enterprise as well as OPNFV Promise. The active
team members are coming from each area, and its development cycle is
neutral for all area.  Additionally, Blazar tends to solve some problems
described in the user story[2] defined by the Product WGs.

The development cycle of the team is following OpenStack patterns.
The team think operator feedbacks are much important to improve Blazar
project and its community. So the priorities for each cycle have been
decided based on not only development requests but operator feedbacks.

The Blazar code is not implemented from scratch by the current active
members. Blazar project was founded at the Icehouse cycle, but inactive
between Kilo and Newton.  At Barcelona Summit, the current members,
some are the real users of Blazar in production and others are operators
of NFV who need Blazar, gathered and started to revive Blazar project.

Blazar project and the team follow the 4 opens:
* Open Source:
  The Blazar source code[3], specifications[4] and documentation[5] are
  completely open source. All are released under the Apache 2.0 licence.

* Open Design:
  The team openly works for all activities. For release milestones, the team
  discussed problems Blazar was facing, work items the team was targeting,
  and project's priorities in etherpad[6], [7]. Additionally, the team had
  meetings in both PTG[7] and Boston Summit[8].

* Open Development:
  All Blazar code is reviewed and hosted in OpenStack CI[9]. The CI
  supports unit tests and Tempest scenario test. All blueprint and bugs
  are tracked by Launchpad[10].

* Open Community:
  All new design and bugs are open in Blazar Launchpad[10]. The team
  weekly IRC meeting[11] is held in a IRC channel for OpenStack projects
  and #openstack-blazar channel is open to everyone who want to discuss
  Blazar-related topics.

Community Infrastructure Sysadmins ===================================== The Infrastructure_ team is responsible for designing, building and maintaining the systems that are used in the day to day operation of the OpenStack project as a whole; this includes development, testing, and collaboration tools. All of the software it runs is open source, and under public configuration management so that everyone in the community has the opportunity to participate. One very effective way to get involved in OpenStack, gaining a deep understanding of and visibility within the community, is by helping operate this infrastructure. Attrition due to shifts in employment or availability of personal time impacts the team's ability to support the community effectively, and so there is a constant need for new contributors who can commit to investing sufficient effort to overcome the steep learning curve associated with these varied technologies. Because our community is global, its support needs span most timezones. Unfortunately, the bulk of long-term contributors to Infrastructure are concentrated in the Americas and so this leaves APAC and EMEA community members with far fewer options for immediate assistance with urgent issues. Gaining more contributors who are active during those times (whether they live in those parts of the World or not) would provide a substantial benefit to the community. This is not necessarily as easy as it sounds because it's harder to get as much overlap with the current bulk of the team for shadowing and knowledge transfer, but there are still some existing team members in those timezones who can help mitigate that somewhat. In particular, the team seeks developers and systems administrators with a background both in maintaining Unix/Linux servers and free software, and places heavy emphasis on systems automation and configuration management (primarily Ansible and Puppet at the moment). Everything possible goes through code review, and gets extensively documented and communicated with the rest of the community over IRC and mailing lists. Server resources are donated by companies operating OpenStack services, and the team also operates a persistent deployment of OpenStack too, so there is substantial opportunity both for people who have experience in those technologies as well as anyone wishing to gain more familiarity with them. Join the #openstack-infra channel on the Freenode IRC network or reach out through the openstack-infra mailing lists on lists.openstack.org if you would like to get involved. It's a rewarding chance to learn and help others, but most of all it's fun! .. _Infrastructure: :ref:project-infrastructure",,51,0

This patch includes three unrelated fixes.

Make qemu use nova user in centos
Libvirt 3.2.0 (latest version in centos) seems to
have changed behavior of dynamic_ownership.

Pin ansible to <2.4 to make ara work in gates
ARA does not work yet with ansible 2.4, this change
pins to lower version to make gates work.
Revert once ara works with 2.4

Disable selinux for oraclelinux and centos.

In order to make it simpler to use the default
configuration files when deploying services
from source, the files are added to pbr's
data_files section so that the files are
included in the built wheels and therefore
deployed with the code. Packaging and deployment
tools can then more easily use the default files
if they wish to.

This pattern is already established with similar
files for neutron, designate and glance as has
been mentioned in the related bug report.

Add parsing of munged data presented by the ceph-proxy
charm in the ceph-public-address relation key; this
includes dropping the addition of the port to the values
added to the list of monitor hosts - this is not required
and the ceph-proxy may provide that data as part of the
ceph-public-address.

This change brings this interface inline with existing
ceph context support in the openstack charm helpers.

Fluentd config actually used two keywords to named log level:
""log_level"" and ""severity_label"".
This doesn't allow to search and sort ALL logs in Kibana using a unique
field (ex: log_level).
This fix standardize log level keyword naming.

When an external Ceph cluster is used, the ""filesystem_store_datadir""
option is set in the ""glance-api.conf"" configuration file.

It should not, it's because of this condition:

  {% elif enable_ceph | bool and glance_backend_ceph | bool %}

When external Ceph cluster is used ""enable_ceph"" is false and
""glance_backend_ceph"" is true.

glance_backend_ceph variable should be enought for this condition.

When heartbeat thread of ironic-conductor server is reporting heartbeat,
it will be interrupted by database exceptions except 'DBConnectionError'.
So add 'Exception' in _conductor_service_record_keepalive to catch all
possible exceptions raised from database to ensure the heartbeat thread
not to exit. And also log the exception information. When the database
recovers from an exception, heartbeat thread will continue to report
heartbeat.

OpenStack Pike drops PKI support, and the keystone charm no longer
configures PKI signing certs for revocation lists@Pike.

Previous changes fixed issues with Keystone v2 based deployments@Pike;
however the Keystone v3 retrieval code did not inspect the status
code on the requests base response during certificate retrieval.

Ensure that a OK status code is returned from Keystone for v3 deploys,
ensuring that Pike based v3 deployments continue to function.

Servers detail call has the extension which adds additional attribute
host_status to the instance (server). This extension mechanism issues a DB
query for each instance.host which can be an overhead for installation
with the large number of hosts. This change eliminates additional queries
and replaces them with a join query.

scenario manager in tempest plugin was copied from
Tempest to avoid any plugin break.

This copied version of scenario manager is using lot of
Tempest interfaces. Many of them are not stable and might
change which can break plugin.

For example - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/503875/3

This commit shrinks the scenario manager copy to keep
only required methods.

scenario manager in tempest plugin was copied from
Tempest to avoid any plugin break.

This copied version of scenario manager is using lot of
Tempest interfaces. Many of them are not stable and might
change which can break plugin.

For example - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/503875/3

This commit shrinks the scenario manager copy to keep
only required methods.

In keystoneauth a workaround was implemented for when the discovery
document has an invalid scheme and host for its URLs[1]. This broke
keystonemiddleware's tests, revealing that keystonemiddleware was, in
one case, validating the wrong URL, and in another mocking the wrong
one. This patch updates the tests so that they are more accurately
representing how keystoneauth works.

Why should we change it here instead of reverting the keystoneauth
change? The URLs in the discovery document aren't validated in real
life, so the only URLs that can be trusted are the ones the user has
accessed, such as the auth URL. Keystoneauth is right to fix the URLs,
and the bad mocks in keystonemiddleware are only evidence that the tests
were wrong, not that the mocked URLs would have worked in real life.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================================ Glance based cinder volume protection plugin ============================================ https://blueprints.launchpad.net/karbor/+spec/backup-volume-data-to-bank Problem description =================== Currently, karbor support using cinder backup, cinder snapshot and freezer plugins to do cinder volume backup. These plugins all store the backup metadata to the bank but not the volume data. In the use case of cross site, we need to do cinder volume backup and restore cross different sites (with different cinder/nova/glance service endpoints), this requires karbor to save the volume data in an independent storage media (bank), so that we can do backup in one site and do restore in another site that the two sites use the same bank. Obviously the cinder volume protection plugins in karbor can not satisfy the cross site needs now. So we should introduce a new volume protection plugin which can save volume data to karbor's bank, like image protection plugin. Backup cinder volume through glance may be a valid choice. Use Cases ========= As explained, users who want to do cross site backup and restore of cinder volumes. Proposed change =============== Add a new volume protection plugin which do the backup and restore of cinder volumes by glance service. Volume data would be stored in the bank as chunks like what image protection plugin do. Steps of protect operation: 1. Create a temporary snapshot to the volume you want to backup 2. Create a temporary volume based on the snapshot in step 1 3. Create an temporary glance image of the temporary volume 4. Download the temporary image and save it to karbor bank 5. Clean all the temporary resources in step 1 to 4 6. Save the backup metadata to bank Steps of restore operation: 1. Create an image with the volume data in bank 2. Create a volume with the created image in step 1 3. Wait for the volume status being available 4. Clean the created image in step 1 Steps in delete operation: 1. List and delete the objects (volume data and metadata) in bank. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None.

In create subnet form, if the Disable Gateway checkbox is checked and
use subnet pool to create subnet, the gateway IP is not empty in the
subnet information that is created. It appears that the back-end

When we backup nova instance with freezer-web-ui, it will fail.
And freezer-agent will raise error with 'NoneType' object has no

incorrect branch of file system backup.

The 'required' option in engine configuration will never be used,

Copy the NovaTimestampObject, added in
I556d93741f1ee965c960c6099fbf2c57f31c6744, to OVO. This provides
a simple way for an object that is backed by a database table with
updated_at and created_at fields to include those fields in the
object.

This functionality is likely useful beyond the scope of nova and
will be needed when the objects used by placement service are
extracted from nova.

The tests may be a bit overkill: they mostly confirm that inheriting
fields works as expected and the DateTimeField behaves as a
DateTimeField.

This patch does quite a few things to improve the performance of the
CentOS tasks:

1) Configures RDO repos as repositories rather than reinstalling an
   RPM each time.
2) GPG keys are only installed if they're needed.
3) Yum repo configs are carefully modified if they already exist
   which avoids removing deployer configurations.
4) Repo priorities are now set in one shot.

This change implements the command
""openstack overcloud container image tag discover"" which will become
part of the update and upgrade workflow for deploying new container
images.

It is used to discover the version-based tag by inspecting the image
from a stable tag like current-tripleo-rdo. Stable tags like 'latest'
or 'pike' can't be used for container updates because something needs
to change to trigger the new containers being pulled. Without this
command it would be up to the user to find out what versioned tag to
specify when calling prepare.

This was implemented as its own command instead of integrating with
prepare because there may be multiple image build chains feeding into
the image list (such as RDO, ceph and eventually others) and each will
need its own call to discover the versioned tag.

  tag=$(openstack overcloud container image tag discover \
        --image trunk.registry.rdoproject.org/pike/centos-binary-base:current-tripleo-rdo
        --tag-from-label rdo_version)
  echo $tag
  openstack overcloud container image prepare --tag $tag

A 400 is returned when making an allocation with a resource class that
does not exist, however the error message refers to whatever the most
recent resource provider uuid was rather than the one that was given
the bad resource class. Since the exception happens outside the loop
that creates the allocations we don't have the association to resource

scenario manager in tempest plugin was copied from
Tempest to avoid any plugin break.

This copied version of scenario manager is using lot of
Tempest interfaces. Many of them are not stable and might
change which can break plugin.

For example - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/503875/3

This commit shrinks the scenario manager copy to keep
only required methods.

ceph-disk uses the same logic for partitioning if wal and db are put on
devices separate from the data device: it will use sgdisk to find the

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== XenAPI: Add support for Virtual GPU (VGPU) ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/xenapi-add-support-for-vgpu Add the feature in xenapi to support Virtual GPU (VGPU). Problem description =================== With some graphics virtualization solutions e.g. Intel's GVT-g and NVIDIA GRID VGPU, a single physical Graphics Processing Unit (PGPU) can be virtualized as multiple virtual Graphics Processing Units(VGPU). And some hypervisors support to boot VMs with VGPU to accelerate graphics processing. But presently Nova can't support VGPU. This proposal is to give a solution in Nova to support VGPU with the XenAPI driver. Use Cases ---------- - VGPUs in the world of XenServer: Some VGPU capable graphics processor units can simulate multiple VGPUs on a single physical GPU(PGPU). We can assign the VGPUs to VMs to accelerate graphics processing. VGPU type: Different types of VGPUs may have different number of supported display heads and maximum resolutions, and are targeted at different classes of workload. Some PGPU model (e.g. GRID K2) may potentially support multiple types of VGPUs, but it can host only one type of the VGPUs at the same time. In order to make it easier for resource tracker, this spec will restrict each PGPU model to only expose one VGPU model. The following are examples for the characteristics for VGPUs:: Example 1 - Intel Corporation Iris Pro Graphics 580 + ---------------------+------------------------------------------+ | PGPU model |Intel Corporation Iris Pro Graphics P6300 | + ---------------------+------------------------------------------+ | VGPU model | Intel GVT-g | + ---------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Max Resolution | 1920x1080 | + ---------------------+------------------------------------------+ | No. of vGPUs | | | per GPU | 8 | +----------------------+------------------------------------------+ Example 2 - NVIDIA GRID K1 + ---------------+-----------------------------------+ | Card Type | NVIDIA GRID K1 | + ---------------+-----------------------------------+ | No. of PGPUs | 4 | + ---------------+-----------------------------------+ | VGPU model |K180Q|K160Q|K140Q|K120Q| K100 | + ---------------+-----------------------------------+ | Max Resolution | 2560x1600 | 1920×1200 | + ------------- -+-----------------------------------+ | No. of vGPUs | | | | | | | per GPU | 4 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | +----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----------+ GPU group: XenServer uses gpu-group to manage GPUs. A gpu-group is a collection of physical GPUs, all of the same type. XenServer automatically creates gpu-group objects at startup to represent the distinct types of physical GPU present on the platform. Once XenServer receives VGPU creation request, it will try to find an available PGPU from the target group. - Boot VM with VGPU in OpenStack * As a cloud administrator, Bob should be able to define a flavor which has the capability of VGPU with desired model name, number of supported display heads and maximum resolutions. * As an end user, Bob should be allowed to boot VMs which having VGPU attached by using the pre-defined flavor. Proposed change =============== 1. The feature of traits is targeted to support representing *quantitative* aspects for resources to differenitiate their characteristics[os-traits]. (V)GPUs also have different characteristics - e.g. model name, number of display heads and maximum resolutions. So let's define the traits which can be associated to the VGPU resource providers. * Traits name space: NS_GPU = ""GPU_"" * model name: GPU_MODEL_GVT_G = NS_GPU + 'MODEL_GVT_G' GPU_MODEL_K1 = NS_GPU + 'MODEL_K1' GPU_MODEL_K120Q = NS_GPU + 'MODEL_K120Q' … * number of display heads: GPU_DISPLAY_HEADS_1 = NS_GPU + 'DISPLAY_HEADS_1' GPU_DISPLAY_HEADS_2 = NS_GPU + 'DISPLAY_HEADS_2' … * maximum resolutions [Display-resolution]: GPU_RESOLUTION_FHD = NS_GPU + 'RESOLUTION_FHD' # 1920 x 1080 GPU_RESOLUTION_WUXGA = NS_GPU + 'RESOLUTION_WUXGA' # 1920 x 1200 GPU_RESOLUTION_WQXGA = NS_GPU + 'RESOLUTION_WQXGA' # 2560 x 1600 … 2. Define a new custom resource for VGPU. In XenAPI driver, it will invoke ResourceClass.normalize_name('VGPU') to get the resource class name. 3. Tracking the VGPU resources: We will use the nested [resource-provider] to tracking the VGPU resources. As described in the above, XenServer will allocated VGPU from the GPU group. So we will create child resource providers under compute node to represent the GPU group; and populate the inventory data containing the amount of VGPUs. resource provider: compute_node / | \ resource provider: GPU_group_1 GPU_group_2 … GPU_group_n / | \ inventory: {'VGPU': amount_1} {'VGPU': amount_2} … {'VGPU': amount_n} In XenAPI virt driver (in the function of get_inventory()), it should query the GPU group and calculate the total capacity for the VGPU. Then it should populate the RPs tree which contain the inventory data for the VGPU resource; and generate the resource providers' traits basing on the VGPU's characteristics. The resource_tracker will persist the RPs tree into placement. The inventory data for VGPU resource should be similar as: { ""resource_class"": ""CUSTOM_VGPU"", ""total"": 8, ""reserved"": 0, ""min_unit"": 1, ""max_unit"": 1, ""step_size"": 1, ""allocation_ratio"": 1.0 } 4. Scheduler: The resource providers will be filtered by placement basing on the resource class and traits [Resource-providers-scheduler]. Note: Before the traits feature is supported, we can only schedule resource providers simply basing on the resource class of VGPU. After traits got ready, we can add traits for the resource provider then it's able to filter resource providers basing on the VGPU's characteristics. 5. In XenAPI, at spawning an instance it should retrieve the VGPU resource specs from the instance request spec and map them to the proper VGPU type and the GPU group. And then pass command to XenServer to create VGPU for this instance. 6. We need define vgpu_whitelist in nova.conf to specify which VGPU models are enabled: Can specify one VGPU model at most for each type of GPU. This configure item could be automatically generated basing on the deployment plan. e.g. vgpu_whitelist=[{'vendor-name': 'Intel Corporation', 'device-name': 'Iris Pro Graphics P6300', 'vgpu_model': 'GPU_MODEL_GVT_G'}] Alternatives ------------ * It has been attempted to support VGPU by creating fake SRIOV-VF PCIs for VGPUs and then passthrough PCI devices [VGPU-passthrough-PCI]. But there is problem to populate the fake PCI's address. And it can't reflect the real situation that some VGPUs are not really PCI devices. * Instead of using the GPU group as the VGPU's resource provider, we can also use each PGPU as a resource provider. But XenServer doesn't supply API to create VGPUs on a specific PGPU. Instead it organizes GPU's in groups, and it will automatically choose a PGPU from the group to host VGPU. So if we make each PGPU as a resource provider, we have to change XenServer's behavior e.g. recreate GPU groups to make each PGPU in a single group; or add XenServer to add a new api to specify which PGPU should the VGPU to be hosted. Data model impact ----------------- No particular data model changes needed, but it depends on the data model defined in [custom-reource-classes] [nested resource provider]. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- When deployment, the deployer should choose a VGPU type to be enabled for each host which will supply VGPUs. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: jianghuaw Other contributors: Work Items ---------- 1. Define traits into os-traits for VGPU; 2. In XenAPI driver, add code to: * query needed data for VGPU which is in the whitelist * generate the nested resource providers * generate the inventory data for resource providers * mapping VGPU's characteristics to the traits defined in os-traits; and associate these traits to the resource providers.

Adding additional options for os_workers.rb:

        os_workers_small
        os_workers_large

os_workers will provide response times close to what
$::processorcount had (with two sockets machines).

os_workers_small will be the existing calculation.

os_workers_large can be used where services are distributed across
multiple machines and high worker count is not a concern.

This patch ensures that if multiple heat units are deployer, that each
one will have the same auth_encryption_key in the /etc/heat/heat.conf.
This is automatically generated on the (juju) leader and then remains
unchanged for the application's duration.  It can be overriden by the
config setting 'encryption-key'.

Testing is via the amulet 500 test (added) which checkes that the two
units deployed have the same key.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode .. =============== Rolling Upgrade =============== Barbican users would like to upgrade their existing environments with minimal downtime. This spec outlines the changes required to be able to assert the various upgrade tags. The goal for Pike is to assert ``assert:supports-rolling-upgrade`` tag. Problem description: ==================== There are currently six upgrade tags: * assert:follows-standard-deprecation * assert:supports-upgrade * assert:supports-accessible-upgrade * assert:supports-rolling-upgrade * assert:supports-zero-downtime-upgrade * assert:supports-zero-impact-upgrade Status tags in Barbican project: * assert:follows-standard-deprecation: Done [1] * assert:supports-upgrade: Implementing [2] * assert:supports-accessible-upgrade: Not yet [3] * assert:supports-rolling-upgrade: Not yet [4] * assert:supports-zero-downtime-upgrade: Not yet [5] * assert:supports-zero-impact-upgrade: Not yet [6] Proposed change: ================ To support rolling upgrade for Barbican, we need to compare with feature lists support for upgrade and rolling upgrade as following: 1. Maintenance Mode 2. Live Migration 3. Upgrade Orchestration 4. Multi-version Interoperability 5. Online Schema Migration 6. Graceful Shutdown 7. Upgrade Gating 8. Project Tagging For Barbican, upgrading from release N-1 to release N then to N+1, we are following supporting status and performing detail items as following: 1. Maintenance Mode: Not yet implement 2. Live Migration: No need to implement * Because Barbican does not have data plane. All information will be stored in its database. 3. Upgrade Orchestration: Not yet implement 4. Multi-version interoperability * API microversion: Not yet - Barbican not need microversions for rolling upgrade. * RPC versioning: Not yet implement. * RPC object version (O.VO): Not yet implement O.VO. 5. Online Schema Migration: Not yet implement 6. Graceful Shutdown: Implemented 7. Upgrade Gating: Implemented 8. Project Tagging: Not yet * Assert the tag and notify the OpenStack Technical Committee Data model impact ----------------- * Impacted because the O.VO codebase will change the way they will communicate to database as well as the data flow between Barbican internal services. REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- End user experience will have minimal downtime when upgrading barbican services. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- It is anticipated that a rolling upgrade will require the operator intervention. Developer impact ---------------- Developers will need to be aware of Barbican features that enable rolling upgrades and make sure they are not removed (Developers will also need to work within the constraints of the database strategy for rolling upgrades, but that developer impact is covered by another spec) Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: - namnh - daidv - hieulq Work Items: ----------- * Apply O.VO in Barbican before rolling upgrade: * Add oslo.versionedobjects to requirements docs. * Create barbican O.VO base objects * Migrate to object * Implement extra fields in objects/fields.py * Create RPC object registry and register all objects. * Create and attach the object serializer. * Implement the indirection API(VersionedObjectIndirectionAPI) in the objects/base.py * Writing Unit Test for Barbican O.VO module. * Performing rolling upgrade for O.VO. * Providing serialized versions. * Create new method to check version. * Implement RPC pinning version. * Create methods to communicating with DB, such as query, save and create. * Performing rolling upgrade for OSM along with O.VO which completed before. * Implementing DB upgrade mechanism for Barbican to perform ``barbican-db-manage`` command via cmd. * Performing data gradually migrate to new schema. by multi-version interoperability (included O.VO and RPC Pinning). * Ensure all data have migrated to new schema via online_data_migrations commandline. * Write documentation for rolling upgrade (operator docs). * Assert the tag and notify the OpenStack Technical Committee.

Turns out this exception is introduced in version 33 of the
websocket library which is not available on some platforms
(rhel 7.x).

Impact on runtime is that if an exception is thrown while connecting
the websocket, the line ""except WebsocketBadStatusException"" will
raise a ValueError, crash everything, AND mask the initial exception.
This change makes the exception reporting slightly less specific but
it is still totally useable.

see: https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/blob/master/ChangeLog

Also, add info logging of websocket status while we're at it

There is a lot discussion with no clear result around this spec:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/94473/10

It is likely that the problem of ""make it easy create resources and configure
tempest for any possible configuration and use case"" is too hard to solve.
However, it may be possible for groups that have a limited set of possible
configurations to use a combination of specified options and discovery to
make configuring tempest significantly easier.

This script assumes there are three entities that may want to contribute to
a fully-formed tempest.conf file:

1. A distribution and/or set of deployment practices for an organization.
   This will cover values that are to be different from the tempest default
   but common to some set of deployment practices. These options can be
   specified in etc/default-overrides.conf and this commit has a sample.

2. An installer. There are certain values that are known to an installer and
   an installer should create a partial tempest.conf file with those values.
   That file can then be passed in to the config script with the
   --deployer-input option.

3. A user. Options can be specified on the command line.

Note that the options specified by (2, 3) override any discovered values.
To get this moving forward, here is a working example of one possible
implementation.

Some missing items:

1. move script to cmd and integrate with new tempest cli 'tempest configure'
2. test plan (without mocking)
3. use new account generation and support a '--test-accounts N' option
4. (maybe) modify devstack to use script to create tempest.conf

When we unshelve an offloaded instance, the scheduler
creates allocations in placement when picking a host.

If the unshelve fails on the host, due to either the
instance claim failing or the guest spawn failing, we
need to remove the allocations since the instance isn't
actually running on that host.

The OpenStack OCF resource definitions for Ceilometer have proven
to be quite brittle, and we can achieve much the same end by just
using the lsb module to track ceilometer-agent-central directly.

Drop all use of ocf:openstack and delete res_ceilometer_polling
which is a) broken for Pike and b) complete misnamed.  Configure
'lsb:ceilometer-agent-central' for all deployments irrespective

This change solves two problmes. First, one off problems waiting
for the cluster to complete. Second, running update_clients too
often. Update clients will get executed only once as soon as
leader_node_is_ready() or client_node_is_ready() returns True.
Subsequent client requests will be handled by normal
amqp-relation-changed hooks.

This changeset adds support for testing openstack-chef-repo with kitchen
and tempest.

Out of 63 tests, 33 pass and 30 are skipped, same as with current CI
tests.

The recipe, run_tempest in openstack-integration-test, is called at the
end of the installation phase.

In addition, a tempest run can be executed manually with
""kitchen verify"".

Previously if enable-live-migration was true and migration-auth-type
was anything other than ""ssh"" then migration setup would be invalid.
The change puts the charm in a blocked state to make it clear that
the migration settings are not valid.

The commit [0] added a explicit call to update_clients
which is executed on every hook run (including update-status),
the update_clients function iterates over all the units
related through the amqp relation and makes a call
to the amqp_changed function.

As the update_status hook interval is set to run every 5 minutes,
isn't convenient to do a call to amqp_changed for every related unit
particularly in large scale deployments, as this might cause
an unwanted workload overhead on the cloud at every tick
of the update-status hook.

Further work needs to be done to improve the overall
handling performed via the update_clients function but
this commit alleviates the problem of leaving the update-status
hook stuck for ~1 hour every time.

Provide a new private function in oslo_policy._checks to evaluate a
check object. This function protects against API changes to the check
classes by inspecting the set of arguments accepted.

Update Enforcer to use the new function instead of invoking checks
directly.

Update the nested check classes (and, or, not) to use the new function
instead of invoking their sub-rules directly.

Update the way mocks were being used in some tests to replace them
with real minimal classes that implement the necessary APIs.

Simplify a few tests that were confirming multiple behaviors (for
example, the result of a compound check as well as the arguments
passed to its nested rules).

Ensure that we have test cases for invoking nested rules that do and
do not accept the new current_rule argument.

However, it does not support strong certificate validation for certificates used to generate image signatures. Specifically, nova has no mechanism to identify trusted certificates. While nova verifies the signature of a signed image using cursive, there is no way to determine if the certificate used to generate and verify that signature is a certificate that is trusted by the user. This change will introduce an addition to the nova API allowing the user to specify a list of trusted certificates when creating or rebuilding a server. These trusted certificates will be used to conduct certificate validation in concert with signature verification in cursive, providing the user confidence in the identity and integrity of the image being booted. Problem description =================== Nova is capable of verifying the signature of a signed image by using cursive, the OpenStack signature verification library [2]. Signature verification ensures that unmodified image data is retrieved from glance. However, the validation of the certificate used to generate the signature of the signed image is currently limited to a timestamp validity check, ensuring only that the certificate is valid for use at the time of signature verification. There is no mechanism to ensure that the certificate used is one approved by the end user. An attacker with access to glance could replace a user's signed image with a modified, malicious image signed with the attacker's certificate, stored in the OpenStack deployment's certificate manager. If asked to boot this modified image, the compute service would retrieve the image and its corresponding certificate, verify the image signature, and proceed to boot a virtual machine using the malicious image data. Providing support for certificate validation in cursive helps nova detect this attack scenario and take steps to alert the user of the potential compromise. Note that this threat model considers glance to be untrusted and does not include threats to the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of nova. It assumes that: (1) an attacker has access to the certificate manager and is able to store certificates for use with image signing, and (2) this attacker is unable to access arbitrary certificate public/private key pairs belonging to other users. An attacker with such access would be able to impersonate the user, replacing signed images and perfectly updating the corresponding image signatures and metadata as needed to conceal the attack. Use Cases --------- Nova users want to ensure that they are booting images they trust by controlling the set of certificates used to sign their images. With this change, a nova user can specify the identities of trusted certificates when creating/rebuilding a server from a signed image if signature verification and certificate validation are enabled. One of these trusted certificates is expected to be the signing certificate of the certificate used to generate the image signature. With certificate validation enabled, image signature verification will only succeed if the image signing certificate was generated by a trusted certificate. This allows users to place themselves in-the-loop of the signature verification process, requiring valid certificate information for boot to succeed. Note that these trusted certificates are stored in a certificate manager independent of the compute service. For this work, a certificate manager is any service backend supported by castellan that provides management operations for certificates objects. Certificate management is often a subset of the functionality provided by generic key managers, which are capable of managing different types of cryptographic secrets (e.g., encryption keys, passwords). As of the Ocata release, barbican (the OpenStack key management service) is the only OpenStack service that satisfies the requirements for a certificate manager. In the future, any OpenStack or third-party service that is supported by castellan and provides certificate management could be used instead of barbican. Proposed change =============== Supporting certificate validation requires several changes. The initial change adds a pair of new configuration options. The first configuration option, enable_certificate_validation, will enable the use of the cursive certificate validation routine when conducting image signature verification (see the fifth change below). This option will only be used if verify_glance_signatures is set to True and will default to False, allowing signature verification to work without certificate validation until a compute deployment has fully upgraded. Certificate validation will only be performed if this option is set to True. The second configuration option, default_trusted_certificate_ids, will contain a list of certificate IDs that are designated as trusted by the compute deployment. This list of trusted certificate IDs will only be used if certificate validation is enabled and if no trusted certificate IDs were provided by the user (see the second and third changes below). The list should be defined by an administrator as it will be the default set of trusted certificate IDs for the compute deployment. The default value of this option will be an empty list, requiring a user-provided set of trusted certificate IDs if left empty. If the user does provide a list of trusted certificate IDs, the list of default trusted certificate IDs will be ignored. The second change adds a parameter, trusted_certificates, to the server create command of the nova API. The value of the parameter is an array containing the string IDs of the trusted certificates used to validate the signed image's signing certificate. These IDs are assigned by the certificate manager upon upload of the trusted certificates. Multiple IDs are allowed here to provide flexibility for the user. It may not be feasible for the user to know which specific certificate corresponds to their image. Allowing the user to define a set of trusted certificates removes the need for an image/certificate mapping, simplifying the user experience. When provided, nova will pass these values to the certificate validation routine in cursive, overriding the default list of trusted certificate IDs (see the second configuration option above). Cursive will use them to fetch the trusted certificates using castellan. This parameter is optional and is ignored by nova when booting a non-signed image or when certificate validation is not enabled. If provided, the value of the parameter is saved and will persist for the lifetime of the server data. The third change adds a parameter, trusted_certificates, to the server rebuild command of the nova API. This parameter is identical to the parameter described in the first change above. This parameter is optional and is ignored by nova when rebuilding a server with a non-signed image or when certificate validation is not enabled. If provided, the value of the parameter is saved and will persist for the lifetime of the server data. If the parameter is not provided when rebuilding a server with a signed image, the prior set of trusted certificate IDs associated with the server will be preserved. The fourth change adds a certificate verification context to conduct certificate validation. This work will live alongside the signature verification routine in the new cursive certificate_utils module. The verification context stores an arbitrary set of certificates and uses them to validate individual certificates submitted for certificate validation. The context attempts to build a certificate chain for submitted certificates, cryptographically verifying that each parent certificate in the chain has signed its child certificate. pyca/cryptography is used to conduct all certificate and cryptographic operations here. The context also checks various constraints to determine if a certificate is valid, including valid timestamp checks. If the context cannot build a valid certificate chain for a submitted certificate, or if any of the certificate constraint checks fail, the submitted certificate fails validation. The fifth change integrates the certificate verification routine into the signature verification workflow. When the certificate verification routine fetches the image's signing certificate, it builds the verification context using the trusted certificates provided by the user (see the first and second changes above). It then passes the signing certificate through the context for certificate validation. If validation succeeds, signature verification can proceed as normal. If validation fails, signature verification fails as well, the server is placed in an ERROR state and a fault is returned to the user. The sixth change updates the nova data model to support certificate validation during server operations, like server evacuation and cold or live migrations. More generally, this applies to any operation that may be done by an admin against the server without all the information the end user originally supplied to the nova boot command. To support these cases, the trusted certificate IDs used for certificate validation must be stored with the instance data, since the user cannot be expected to provide them. The InstanceExtra functionality in nova already supports keypairs associated with instances. This change will update the InstanceExtra schema to support a trusted_certificate_ids column, which will contain the list of trusted certificate IDs. The underlying storage will leverage oslo versionedobjects, requiring a new trusted_certificate_id module in nova/objects. The seventh change updates the novaclient/openstackclient to support the trusted_certificates parameter for the server create/rebuild commands. This includes support for a new environment variable, OS_TRUSTED_CERTIFICATE_IDS, that can be used to define a comma-delimited list of trusted certificate IDs. If the trusted_certificates parameter is not used, the client will pull the value of the environment variable and use it instead. This value will be converted into a list before being passed on. If the user does not provide a value for the trusted_certificates parameter, either explicitly or through the OS_TRUSTED_CERTIFICATE_IDS environment variable, nova will pull the list of trusted certificate IDs from the default_trusted_certificate_ids configuration option. If this option is left as an empty list, there is no way for nova to obtain a trusted certificate for certificate validation. In this case there would be no way to determine if the image's signing certificate is trusted so signature verification would fail, in turn failing server creation. Alternatives ------------ An alternative approach to certificate validation here would be to support certificate trust stores, collections of trusted certificates associated with individual users or projects. When creating a new server, the user would specify their trust store as a source of trusted certificates, replacing the list of certificates provided in the trusted_certificates parameter. There are many ways to support trust stores, including: a filesystem directory trust store containing trusted certificate files stored locally on the compute host, a metadata/managed resource approach supported under services like nova or keystone, and a container-based secret storage approach supported by services like barbican. While useful in defining collections of trusted certificates, a trust store approach would need to scale for large cloud deployments which may be difficult from a management and maintenance perspective. Trust stores also introduce a new construct that must be trusted by the user, especially if the user is not directly responsible for maintaining their trust store. These restrictions may not be feasible for some cloud deployments. An alternative to the user providing trusted certificates, or storing trusted certificates in a trust store, would be to dynamically fetch certificates using information stored in the Private Internet Extension of the signed certificate being validated. This approach allows deployers and users to use signing certificates without needing to pre-fetch all of the root and intermediate certificates required to complete the certificate validation process. However, this approach requires the compute service have persistent network access to all possible certificate repositories where root and intermediate certificates may be stored. In many cases, this will include network access to the public Internet which may not be feasible for a generic deployment. An enhanced certificate validation routine would include certificate revocation, supporting commonly used approaches like certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and/or the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). Supporting certificate revocation would allow the compute service to dynamically determine when certificates become invalid in real time due to compromise, further improving the security of booting signed images. However, supporting certificate revocation involves dynamically fetching and trusting network resources, often under the control and authority of third-parties. This may not be feasible for some deployments. It is possible that certificate revocation could be integrated outside of the compute service, for example within the certificate manager or through another third-party service. This would grant nova the benefits of timely revocation without complicating the signature verification and certificate validation features in nova itself. It should be noted here that support for certificate revocation is intended to be added in future work for this feature. Data model impact ----------------- The InstanceExtra database model will be updated to include a new text column, trusted_certificate_ids, which will contain the list of trusted certificate IDs provided with server create/rebuild requests. As stated above, if the IDs are not included with the server request, they will be pulled from the default_trusted_certificate_ids configuration option. Like the existing fields in InstanceExtra, this addition will leverage oslo versionedobjects for storing the list, requiring the addition of a nova/objects/trusted_certificate_id module defining the necessary objects. REST API impact --------------- The following are example requests to (1) create a new server from a signed image and (2) rebuild a server from a signed image, including the new trusted_certificates parameter. This update will be done under a new API microversion. .. code-block:: javascript { ""server"": { ""name"": ""example-name"", ""imageRef"": ""70a599e0-31e7-49b7-b260-868f441e862b"", ""flavorRef"": ""http://openstack.example.com/flavors/1"", ""trusted_certificates"": [ ""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"", ""11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"", ""22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222"" ], ""metadata"": { ""My Server Name"": ""Example Signed Server"" } } } .. code-block:: javascript { ""rebuild"": { ""name"": ""example-name"", ""imageRef"": ""70a599e0-31e7-49b7-b260-868f441e862b"", ""trusted_certificates"": [ ""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"", ""11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"", ""22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222"" ], ""metadata"": { ""My Server Name"": ""Example Signed Server"" } } } Note that while in these examples the values in trusted_certificates are UUIDs they are not guaranteed to be so. Certificate managers use different ID allocation schemes; while some use strict UUIDs, others use simple incrementing integers or raw hex strings. For this feature, the type of trusted_certificates will be an array containing zero or more JSON string values. The following is a JSON schema description of the trusted_certificates parameter: .. code-block:: javascript { ""type"": ""array"", ""minItems"": 0, ""maxItems"": 50, ""uniqueItems"": true, ""items"": { ""type"": ""string"" } } Note the upper and lower bounds for the number of certificate IDs included in the trusted_certificates parameter. If an API call is made for a signed image and exceeds the maximum number of allowed certificate IDs, then the API call will fail. Security impact --------------- With the added verification step provided by this feature when enabled, the security of the signed image verification feature is improved. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- This change imposes additional restrictions on the certificates that can be used to sign images, and may cause migration challenges if used with images signed before the feature is enabled. Migration will require users to upload their trusted certificates to the certificate manager if they intend to specify them with the create or rebuild request. All image signing certificates must already be in the certificate manager to support signature verification. With support being added for the OS_TRUSTED_CERTIFICATE_IDS environment variable, users are encouraged to set the variable with the list of trusted certificate IDs through their openrc file, alongside their authentication credentials. The value of the OS_TRUSTED_CERTIFICATE_IDS environment variable is a comma-delimited string of trusted certificate IDs, which will be converted into a list of certificate IDs for the trusted_certificates parameter. An example openrc file is shown below, using the same trusted certificate IDs as those used in the API example (see REST API Impact above): .. code-block:: javascript export OS_USERNAME=username export OS_PASSWORD=password export OS_TENANT_NAME=projectName export OS_AUTH_URL=https://identityHost:portNumber/v2.0 export OS_TRUSTED_CERTIFICATE_IDS=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000,111111 11-1111-1111-1111-111111111111,22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222 Note that in this example, the second certificate ID is split to satisfy line wrap formatting for this spec. No explicit linebreaks should be used in the actual openrc file. Performance Impact ------------------ Nova will load the user's trusted certificates via cursive every time signature verification is performed. Depending upon the size and number of certificates, and the frequency of signature verification, this could introduce a performance burden on the compute service. To alleviate this, see Alternatives above regarding a persistent certificate trust store and dynamically loading certificates from remote storage. Other deployer impact --------------------- The inclusion of two new configuration options, enable_certificate_validation and default_trusted_certificate_ids, will smooth the transition for deployments looking to enable this feature. If these options are enabled, all prior usage of the server create/rebuild API when booting signed images will now fail if trusted certificates cannot be located. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Peter Hamilton Work Items ---------- * Add two new configuration options, enable_certificate_validation and default_trusted_certificate_ids. The first will enable the use of certificate validation if signature verification is enabled. The second will provide a default list of trusted certificate IDs that can be used if no trusted certificate IDs are provided with the server request. * Update cursive to support certificate validation. This includes the addition of the certificate verification context class and the verify_certificate routine which loads certificates from the certificate manager and uses the certificate verification context to conduct certificate validation. * Update the existing signature verification workflow in nova to incorporate certificate validation, using the verify_certificate routine in cursive to validate the signing certificate. * Update the InstanceExtra database model to include a new text column, trusted_certificate_ids. Database migrations will be included to add/remove this column when updating/downgrading the database schema. * Add a new nova API parameter, trusted_certificates, to the server create and rebuild commands. The value of this parameter will need to be passed through to the signature verification step when downloading the image from glance. * Update novaclient to support the trusted_certificates parameter. * Update novaclient to pull the value of the OS_TRUSTED_CERTIFICATE_IDS environment variable when the trusted_certificates parameter is not provided by the user. * Update openstackclient to support the trusted_certificates parameter. * Update openstackclient to pull the value of the OS_TRUSTED_CERTIFICATE_IDS environment variable when the trusted_certificates parameter is not provided by the user. Dependencies ============ This work is dependent on the creation and deployment of a gate-tempest-dsvm-security-ubuntu-xenial job which runs tempest with signed images and barbican as the certificate manager. For more information on this work, see the corresponding tempest blueprint [6]. Testing ======= Unit tests will be included to test the functionality implemented in nova, novaclient, and openstackclient. Tempest tests will also be implemented to test the end-to-end feature across glance and nova. Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation on the trusted_certificates API parameter and the two new configuration options will need to be added, as will instructions defining the OS_TRUSTED_CERTIFICATE_IDS environment variable and its usage.

Online: https://github.com/pyca/cryptography History ======= This specification has received extensive review from the OpenStack community given that it involves security features in nova. The following is a brief timeline of this proposal's history, with major changes documented below during each development cycle. ..list-table:: Revisions :header-rows: 1 * - Release Name - Description * - Newton - Rough draft published * - Ocata - Introduced for official review * - Pike - Re-proposed for official review Newton ------ The initial version of this spec was released towards the end of the Newton development cycle in preparation for Ocata, focusing on a certificate trust store implementation rooted on the compute host filesystem and managed by the cloud administrator. Versions 2, 3, and 4 involved minor formatting and grammatical updates. Version 5 received feedback from the nova core team, focusing specifically on (1) the need for tighter integration between trusted certificate management and tenant users, and (2) the potential scalability issues with distributed certificate file management across large clouds. Further feedback was also solicited from the community through a post to the openstack-dev mailing list [7]. Version 6 updated the proposed approach, preserving the filesystem-based certificate trust store while adding an update to the nova API. This API change allowed users to specify the trusted certificate ID when creating new instances. Ocata ----- Version 7 incorporated feedback received from the Ocata Design Summit, officially removing the filesystem-based certificate trust store approach and focusing solely on updating the nova API to allow the user to submit a set of trusted certificate IDs when creating new instances. Version 8 addressed further feedback from the nova core team, including: * highlighting a dependency on barbican as the only supported castellan backend * updating the nova API changes to include the rebuild operation * updating the nova data model to support storing the set of trusted certificate IDs with the instance data in instance_extras, thereby supporting automatic operations like instance evacuation and cold/live migrations Pike ---- Version 9 duplicated Version 8 as a clean slate for the Pike review process. Version 10 addressed minor whitespace and spec formatting errors. Version 11 added the new History section from the Pike spec template and incorporated feedback received on Version 9, clarifying API details and reordering the Security, Other end user, and Other deployer impact sections. Version 12 addressed further reviewer feedback, clarifying nova handling of the API changes and resolving discrepancies in spec details. Version 13 updated the spec to reflect the integration of cursive into nova, moving the certificate validation code to cursive. Version 14 added support for two new configuration options to smooth the transition to use for certificate validation, in addition to clarifying the use of oslo versionedobjects for the modification to InstanceExtra.

Some code refactoring in TrackerWorker and RouteTableManager,
in particular to prepare a proper fix to bug bug/1716893 and
avoid TrackerWorker and RouteTableManager tests to change threads
(which makes it a pain to debug/trace with pdb).

The name of callbacks for TrackerWorker subclasses are
changed to avoid a leading _ because it's not natural to
consider these private methods.

OpenStack Pike drops PKI support, and the keystone charm no longer
configures PKI signing certs for revocation lists@Pike.

Previous changes fixed issues with Keystone v2 based deployments@Pike;
however the Keystone v3 retrieval code did not inspect the status
code on the requests base response during certificate retrieval.

Ensure that a OK status code is returned from Keystone for v3 deploys,
ensuring that Pike based v3 deployments continue to function.

In keystoneauth a workaround was implemented for when the discovery
document has an invalid scheme and host for its URLs[1]. This broke
keystonemiddleware's tests, revealing that keystonemiddleware was, in
one case, validating the wrong URL, and in another mocking the wrong
one. This patch updates the tests so that they are more accurately
representing how keystoneauth works.

Why should we change it here instead of reverting the keystoneauth
change? The URLs in the discovery document aren't validated in real
life, so the only URLs that can be trusted are the ones the user has
accessed, such as the auth URL. Keystoneauth is right to fix the URLs,
and the bad mocks in keystonemiddleware are only evidence that the tests
were wrong, not that the mocked URLs would have worked in real life.

A race condition exists between l3 agents after a HA router delete RPC:
Once a fanout HA router delete notification comes to the scheduled
agents, the master router in one agent will delete all HA attributes
and processes, such as keepalived VRRP, but because the backup router
in another agent has not ever got/run the HA router delete procedure,
or anything that delay the backup to remove its VRRP process, then the
VRRP protocol will set its router state to master.
Then HaRouter in backup l3 agent will run a series of operations, such
as respawn the external processes, notify neutron server that here has
a HA router with master state.

This may be racy when delete rpc try to remove HA router resources
and enqueue_state_change try to add some resources.

For the spawned processes, it will stay alive after HA router
and all its resources/attributes/processes were deleted when
the backup(agent) concurrently run the delete procedure.

This patch reuse the RouterProcessingQueue to deal with the HA
router state change event. And it added a new update action type
'HA_ROUTER_STATE_CHANGE = 3' which is only triggered by the HA
router state change event. Then put the HA router state change
and HA router delete all in the queue to prevent the race. It's
the way that treating the state change event as a router update
event.

OpenStack client is not a runtime dependency of ironicclient,
and having it in requirements just brings in many dependencies
which might not be needed at all when using the Python API of the client
only (for example in server-side applications).

Although dependency on osc-lib is enough for unit tests, add
python-openstackclient to test-requirements so that functional tests
pass.

Also, add a setuptools 'extra' so that users can install
python-openstackclient together with ironicclient if wishing to do so

The nova-powervm driver should be installed on the management VM. .. _NovaLink: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/POWER8/p8eig/p8eig_kickoff.htm **Note:** Installing the NovaLink software creates the ``pvm_admin`` group. In order to function properly, the user executing the Nova compute service must be a member of this group. Use the ``usermod`` command to add the user. For example, to add the user ``stacker`` to the ``pvm_admin`` group, execute:: sudo usermod -a -G pvm_admin stacker The user must re-login for the change to take effect. The NovaLink architecture is such that the compute driver runs directly on the PowerVM system. No external management element (e.g. Hardware Management Console or PowerVC) is needed. Management of the virtualization is driven through a thin virtual machine running on the PowerVM system. Configuration of the PowerVM system and NovaLink is required ahead of time. If the operator is using volumes or Shared Storage Pools, they are required to be configured ahead of time. Configuration File Options -------------------------- After nova has been installed the user must enable PowerVM as the compute driver. To do so, set the ``compute_driver`` value in the ``nova.conf`` file to ``compute_driver = powervm.driver.PowerVMDriver``. ",,39,0

Few of functions were modified for further implementation of negative
tempest tests:
- Invalid L3 BGPVPN can be created - with eRT<>iRT instead of RT
- L3 BGPVPN is created without network associations - they must be
  added later if necessary
- Function to update route targets for L3 BGPVPN
- Function to add L3 BGPVPN associations for all networks added
- Two L3 BGPVPNs can be created with different RT or eRT-iRT pair
- Function to create singular network association added
- L3 BGPVPN check can expect now failure of ping test
- Existing tests modified to add network associations separately
- Checking of L3 BGPVPN connectivity can be done without fip
  association
- Improved floating ip storage to have flexibility in selection of
  ping's origin

- When a route target is incorrect in the create or update form
a popup message should indicate that validation of this field failed.
This message doesn't display and instead a generic error is returned.
It's a mistake to convert the route_target which is charfield type to
a list in the clean method.
This, need to be done after in the handle method when the datas are ""cleaned"".

- Fix also bad behavior when a admin user update a BGPVPN. In some cases
update doesn't work when the RT field are edited.

find_shard_ranges seems like a function that a broker should provide,
and making it a broker method makes it a little easier to unit test.

This patch also:
- changes the method return type to a list of ShardRanges
- drops node index from shard container name md5 hash (to make
  it more convenient for a broker to generate the name)
- adjusts the shard point search query for an off-by-one (shard
  were coming back in desired size + 1)
- make container start sharding when they are *equal to* or
  greater than shard_container_size - that way when a container
  first reaches the threshold we get two shards - before we got
  two but only by virtue of them being desired size +1.
- adds a unit test

This patches removes the need to update the port name when it is
associated to a pod. It still allows it by enabling the port_debug
option at kuryr.conf. By default is set to False, which means it
will not set any name for the ports being used by the pods, nor
to the pods available in the port pools. This makes it similar to
VMs booted with Nova, where unless a predefined port is used, the
port will be created and used without setting any name.

Thanks to disabling the port_debug, a call to Neutron to update the
port name is saved, with the consequent speed up in containers boot
up time, as well as minimization of congestion on the Neutron side
in case of many containers being created at the same time.

Adds two new functions:

- get_foreign_key_constraint_name() - common function
  used in subprojects which retrieves the name of a
  foreign key constraint given table name / column name
- suspend_fk_constraints_for_col_alter() - given table name and column
  name, locates matching foreign key constraints, drops them,
  yields context, then recreates them as they were.
  By default only runs for NDB thus avoiding expensive
  constraint regeneration on other backends.

This patch includes three unrelated fixes.

Make qemu use nova user in centos
Libvirt 3.2.0 (latest version in centos) seems to
have changed behavior of dynamic_ownership.

Pin ansible to <2.4 to make ara work in gates
ARA does not work yet with ansible 2.4, this change
pins to lower version to make gates work.
Revert once ara works with 2.4

Disable selinux for oraclelinux and centos.

Problem description =================== In many of Heat resource plug-in implementations, properties are getting defined with validation schema and there is no group concept which is required for following reasons: * sometimes, resource mandates to provide either PropertyA or PropertyB, and one of them is mandatory. This can't be defined now in Heat Properties schema, as developer can't set required=true for both the properties and as part of validate() method, developer should implement the logic whether one of these property is provided. * some plug-ins supports multiple versions of its thing, for example, docker plug-in supports multiple versions. So some properties are only supported in specific versions only. Now there is no generic way to specify declaratively that some properties are required for a given client version. Proposed change =============== The first problem could be solved by introducing the concept of PropertiesGroup, which helps declarative validation as defined below: Resource class will have `properties_groups_schema`, which contains list of properties groups. Each properties group has next representation: Assume that there are two Properties: PropertyA and PropertyB, and there are already declared with proper Property Schema. Then properties group will be specified by logical expression in dict: .. code-block:: python properties_groups_schema = [ {properties_group.AND: [[PropertyA], [PropertyB]]} ] In that way, logical expression consists of one-key dict with list-type value, which can contain list-type properties names or properties group logical expression. Dictionary key should be equal to one of the following operators: ""and"", ""or"", ""xor"". Properties groups can be nested, for example: .. code-block:: python properties_groups_schema = [ {properties_group.AND: [ {properties_group.OR: [[PropertyA], [PropertyB]]}, [propertyC]]} ] Here as part of 'validation()' phase, each of the groups in the property_groups_schema will be validated in sequence by using the operator across properties. This helps to bring up the complex validation logic across dependent properties. Each group declared in the properties_groups_schema can refer the other group in it's properties list. So the complex validation could be: Here, each of the property entry could be defined in the form of ['prp1', 'child_prp1', 'grand_child_prp1'] even if property entry comprises only one item, i.e. ['prp1'] For example, if there's properties_schema: .. code-block:: python properties_schema = { PropertyA: properties.Schema( properties.Schema.MAP, schema={ PropertySubA: properties.Schema(properties.Schema.STRING), PropertySubB: properties.Schema(properties.Schema.STRING) } ) } Then properties_groups_schema should be next: .. code-block:: python properties_groups_schema = [ {properties_group.AND: [[PropertyA, PropertySubA], [PropertyA, PropertySubB]]} ] Also, properties group will support specifying API versions of `client_plugin`, used for property, i.e. property will be supported only if specified `client_plugin` API version satisfies versions in group. Then property group will have next format: .. code-block:: python properties_groups_schema = [ {properties_group.API_VERSIONS: { properties_group.CLIENT_PLUGIN: <client_plugin object>, properties_group.VERSIONS: <list of supported versions>, properties_group.PROPERTIES: <list of properties entries>} } ] Example of using `API_VERSIONS` as properties group: .. code-block:: python properties_groups_schema = [ {properties_group.API_VERSIONS: { properties_group.CLIENT_PLUGIN: self.client_plugin('keystone'), properties_group.VERSIONS: ['1.2', '2.0'], properties_group.PROPERTIES: [[PropertyA], [PropertyB]]} } ] Heat engine can infer that this set of properties in the properties group is supported only for 1.2 and 2.0 API versions, so it can check the current `client_plugin` supported and validate accordingly. Besides the validation part, all necessary changes will be added to documentation generator to allow user learn relations between properties. Alternatives ------------ None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Kanagaraj Manickam (kanagaraj-manickam) Peter Razumovsky <prazumovsky> Milestones ---------- Currently moved to backlog due to no community's interest. Workable PoC placed here: https://review.openstack.org/#/q/topic:bp/property-group Work Items ---------- * Define PropertiesGroup class with required validation logic for the given resource * Update the resource validation logic to validate with property group * Update the existing resources with property_groups * Generate property group documentation for users to understand the property requirements * Add required test cases Dependencies ============ None.
