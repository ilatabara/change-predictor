This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================= Virtual guest device role tagging ================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/virt-device-role-tagging This will provide a mechanism for the user to tag a device they have assigned to their guest with a specific role. The tag will be matched to the hardware address of the device and this mapping exposed to the guest OS via metadata service/cloud-init. Problem description =================== It is common to create virtual instances which have multiple network devices or disk drives. The tenant user creating the instance will often have a specific role in mind for each of the devices. For example, a particular disk may be intended for use as Oracle database storage, or as a Squid webcache storage, etc. Similarly there may be specific network interfaces intended for use by a network service application running in the guest. The tenant user who is creating the instance does not have an explicit way to communicate the intended usage of each device to the application running inside the guest OS. It may appear possible to identify a device via some aspect that the tenant user knows, and then use the cloud-init / metadata service to provide a mapping to the guest. For example, a MAC address could potentially be used to identify NICs, or a disk device name string could be used to identify disks. The user would then set a metadata tag eg :: # nova boot \ --image mywebappimage \ --flavor m1.large \ --meta oracledata=vda \ --meta apachefrontend=02:10:22:32:33:22 \0 mywebapp The problem is that because Nova tries to hide as much detail of the guest hardware setup as possible, it is not easy for the tenant user to know what the unique identifiers for each device are. For example, while with emulated NICs, it is possible to know the MAC address before booting the instance, when using PCI assigned devices, this is not available. Another approach might appear to be to identify devices based on the order in which they appear to guests. eg the application in the guest could be set to use the 3rd PCI NIC, or the 2nd disk on the SCSI bus. The problem with this is that neither Nova or the underlying hypervisor is able to provide a strong guarantee around the device ordering in the guest. By good fortune, the order in which disks are listed on the nova boot command line, often matches the order in which device letters are assigned by Linux, but nothing guarantees this to be the case long term. Use Cases ---------- The tenant user needs to provide information to the guest instance to identify which device to use for a desired guest application role. For example, the tenant user wishes to instruct the Oracle database to use a particular SCSI disk for its data storage, because they have configured that disk to use a particular cinder volume that is built for high throughput. Or they may wish to instruct an NFV application that it should process data from a particular network interface, because that interface is connected to an interface in a second guest which is sending the required network traffic. The tenant needs to be able to provide this identification information to the guest OS, without knowing about how the particular hypervisor will configure the virtual hardware. Proposed change =============== The proposal is to extend the REST API so that when adding disks or network interfaces to a guest instance, it is possible to pass an opaque string ""tag"". When booting a guest, Nova will determine what PCI, USB, SCSI address corresponds to the device the user asked for, and create a metadata file that maps the user provided tag to the hypervisor assigned device address. This metadata file will be provided via either cloud-init or the metadata service. When the guest OS image boots up, it will read this metadata file to determine which devices need to be used for particular application services running in the instance. How the guest OS does this is outside the scope of this spec. Nova is merely defining a file format and a set of information it will contain, which the guest OS and/or applications can consume in a manner which they prefer. There are no current standards in this area, so it is a greenfield design for the file format. For example, consider that the user ran :: nova boot \ --image mywebappimage \ --flavor m1.large \ --nic net-id=12345,tag=nfvfunc1 \ --nic net-id=56789,tag=nfvfunc2 \ --block-device volume_id=12345,bus=scsi,tag=oracledb \ --block-device volume_id=56789,bus=virtio,tag=squidcache \ mynfvapp The Nova could then auto-generate a metadata file that contained the following, based on information reported by the Nova libvirt driver for the guest instance: :: { ""devices"": [ { ""type"": ""nic"", ""bus"": ""pci"", ""address"": ""0000:00:02.0"", ""mac"": ""01:22:22:42:22:21"", ""tags"": [""nfvfunc1""] }, { ""type"": ""nic"", ""bus"": ""pci"", ""address"": ""0000:00:03.0"", ""mac"": ""01:22:22:42:22:21"", ""tags"": [""nfvfunc2""] }, { ""type"": ""disk"", ""bus"": ""scsi"", ""address"": ""1:0:2:0"", ""serial"": ""disk-vol-2352423"", ""tags"": [""oracledb""] }, { ""type"": ""disk"", ""bus"": ""pci"", ""address"": ""0000:00:07.0"", ""serial"": ""disk-vol-24235252"", ""tags"": [""squidcache""] } ] } In this example, we have provide a few bits of information about the devices * The type of device info is provided for. Currently this is 'nic' or 'disk'. Other types will be provided in the future. * The bus the device is attached to. This can be ""pci"", ""scsi"", ""usb"", ""ide"" and similar things. This is basically saying how to interpret the device address. The bus may be ""none"" in the case of containers, or where the device is integrated into the platform board. * The device address. The format of the address varies based on the bus, but would be the PCI address, or SCSI address, of USB port, or IDE channel, etc. * The network device MAC address, if type==nic. * The disk drive serial string (if set & type==disk). * The network device name, if type==nic and the hypervisor supports explicit device names (ie containers) * The disk device name, if type==disk and the hypervisor supports explicit device names (ie containers) * It is possible for the same tag to appear multiple times against different device types * If the hypervisor provides two devices which mapo to the same backend, it is possible for the same tag to appear in both. This is the case with Xen HVM guests where a single block device is exposed via both Xen paravirt disk and IDE emulated disk. The guest chooses which to use. * Although the syntax supports setting of multiple tags per device, initially the impl will only allow a single tag. The syntax just allows for future extension should there be a need. Note that not all architectures support PCI buses, for example armv7 and s390 don't, so if a guest OS wishes to be portable it must not assume it will get devices of a particular type. As such for device addressing, only the ""bus"" attribute would be considered mandatory, the ""address"" attribute may be omitted if that data is not available. Network devices would always have a ""mac"" attribute present. Disk devices would have a ""serial"" attribute present if the disk had an associated unique serial set. The virt drivers in Nova would endeavour to make available as much information as possible. The data reported to the guest OS will be considered a stable API that must be maintained across future Nova releases in a backwards compatible manner. As such, the data will be made to conform to a formal JSON schema, which will be append-only to ensure future compatibility. :: { ""$schema"": ""http://json-schema.org/schema#"", ""id"": ""http://openstack.org/schemas/nova/metadata/device-role-tagging/1.0"", ""definitions"": { ""nonedevicebus"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""bus"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""pattern"": ""none"" } }, ""required"": [ ""bus"" ] }, ""pcidevicebus"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""bus"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""pattern"": ""pci"" }, ""address"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""pattern"": ""[a-f0-9]{4}:[a-f0-9]{2}:[a-f0-9]{2}.[a-f0-9]"" } }, ""required"": [ ""bus"" ] }, ""usbdevicebus"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""bus"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""pattern"": ""usb"" }, ""address"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""pattern"": ""[a-f0-9]+:[a-f0-9]+"" } }, ""required"": [ ""bus"" ] }, ""scsidevicebus"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""bus"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""pattern"": ""scsi"" }, ""address"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""pattern"": ""[a-f0-9]+:[a-f0-9]+:[a-f0-9]+:[a-f0-9]+"" } }, ""required"": [ ""bus"" ] }, ""idedevicebus"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""bus"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""pattern"": ""ide"" }, ""address"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""pattern"": ""[0-1]:[0-1]"" } }, ""required"": [ ""bus"" ] }, ""anydevicebus"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""oneOf"": [ { ""$ref"": ""#/definitions/pcidevicebus"" }, { ""$ref"": ""#/definitions/usbdevicebus"" }, { ""$ref"": ""#/definitions/idedevicebus"" }, { ""$ref"": ""#/definitions/scsidevicebus"" }, { ""$ref"": ""#/definitions/nonedevicebus"" } ] }, ""nicdevice"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""mac"": { ""type"": ""string"" } ""devname"": { ""type"": ""string"" } }, ""required"": [""mac""], ""additionalProperties"": { ""allOf"": [ { ""$ref"": ""#/definitions/anydevicebus"" } ] } }, ""diskdevice"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""serial"": { ""type"": ""string"" }, ""path"": { ""type"": ""string"" } }, ""additionalProperties"": { ""allOf"": [ { ""$ref"": ""#/definitions/anydevicebus"" } ] } } }, ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""devices"": { ""type"": ""array"", ""items"": { ""type"": [ { ""$ref"": ""#/definitions/nicdevice"" }, { ""$ref"": ""#/definitions/diskdevice"" } ] } } } } The implementation will consist of several parts. There will be a set of python classes defined in nova/virt/metadata.py that are capable of representing the data described by the JSON schema above, and generating a compliant JSON document. The virt drivers will be extended to populate instances of these classes with the data associated with each instance. The initial implementation will be done for the Libvirt driver, however, other virt driver maintainers are encouraged to provide the same functionality. The metadata API will be extended to be capable of reporting this data associated with a guest instance. This has a chicken and egg scenario for network configuration. Guests relying on the metadata service will need to do a minimal network configuration to reach the metadata service and obtain the info from Nova. They can then re-configure networking based on the device tag information. The config driver generator will be extended to be capable of including this JSON data associated with a guest instance. This is the preferred method where guests need to rely on tags to confgure networking, as it has no chicken & egg scenario. In the future QEMU will be able export metadata directly via the firmware so it will be available directly from the very earliest stages of boot. It is expected this will be used as an additional optional transport in the future. Outside the scope of the Nova work, a simple tool will be created that can parse this metadata file and set tags against devices in the udev database. It is anticipated that cloud-init would trigger this tool. Thus (Linux) applications / OS images would not need to directly understand this Nova JSON format. Instead they could just query udev to ask for details of the device with a particular tag. This avoids the applications needing to deal with the countless different device bus types or addressing formats. Example for Xen HVM with dual-disk devices :: { ""devices"": [ { ""type"": ""nic"", ""bus"": ""xen"", ""address"": ""0"", ""mac"": ""01:22:22:42:22:21"", ""tags"": [""nfvfunc1""] }, { ""type"": ""nic"", ""bus"": ""xen"", ""address"": ""1"", ""mac"": ""01:22:22:42:22:21"", ""tags"": [""nfvfunc2""] }, { ""type"": ""disk"", ""bus"": ""ide"", ""address"": ""0:0"", ""serial"": ""disk-vol-123456"", ""tags"": [""oracledb""] }, { ""type"": ""disk"", ""bus"": ""xen"", ""address"": ""0"", ""path"": ""/dev/xvda"", ""serial"": ""disk-vol-123456"", ""tags"": [""oracledb""] } { ""type"": ""disk"", ""bus"": ""ide"", ""address"": ""0:1"", ""serial"": ""disk-vol-789321"", ""tags"": [""squidcache""] }, { ""type"": ""disk"", ""bus"": ""xen"", ""address"": ""1"", ""path"": ""/dev/xvdb"", ""serial"": ""disk-vol-789321"", ""tags"": [""squidcache""] } ] } Some things to note about this Xen example. * There are two logical disks here, which Xen has exposed as *both* IDE and Xen paravirt. * For the Xen paravirt disks, Xen can also provide a fixed guest path. * The address for devices on Xen bus is just an integer which maps into the XenBus namespace. Example for LXC container :: { ""devices"": [ { ""type"": ""nic"", ""bus"": ""none"", ""mac"": ""01:22:22:42:22:21"", ""devname"": ""eth0"", ""tags"": [""nfvfunc1""] }, { ""type"": ""nic"", ""bus"": ""none"", ""mac"": ""01:22:22:42:22:21"", ""devname"": ""eth1"", ""tags"": [""nfvfunc2""] }, { ""type"": ""disk"", ""bus"": ""none"", ""serial"": ""disk-vol-2352423"", ""path"": ""/dev/sda"", ""tags"": [""oracledb""] }, { ""type"": ""disk"", ""bus"": ""none"", ""serial"": ""disk-vol-24235252"", ""path"": ""/dev/sdb"", ""tags"": [""squidcache""] } ] } Some things to note about this LXC example: * Containers do not export device buses to guests, as they don't emulate hardware. Thus the 'bus' is 'none' and there is no corresponding 'address' * Containers are able to provide fixed disk paths and NIC device names Alternatives ------------ Many users facing this problem have requested that Nova allow them to specify a fixed PCI address when creating disks and/or network interfaces. In a traditional data center virtualization world this would be an acceptable request, but a goal of the cloud is to isolate tenant users from the specifics of guest hardware configuration. Such configuration requires intimate knowledge of the underlying hypervisor which is simply not available to tenant users, nor should they be expected to learn that. In view of this, it is considered inappropriate to allow tenant users to control the guest device addressing via the REST API. As noted in the problem description another approach is for the tenant user to manually set tags via the existing mechanism for providing user metadata to guests. This however relies on the user knowing some unique identifying attribute for the device upfront. In some cases this is possible, but there are a number of cases where no such information is available. Data model impact ----------------- The BlockDeviceMapping object (and associated table) will gain a freeform string attribute, named ""tag"". The NetworkRequest object (and associated table) will gain a freeform string attribute, named ""tag"". In future other device types, such as PCI devices or serial ports, may also gain similar ""tag"" attributes. For the initial implementation only the disk and network objects are to be dealt with. REST API impact --------------- The block device mapping data format will gain a new freeform string parameter, named ""tag"", which can be set against each disk device. This would affect the APIs for booting instances and hot-adding disks. In terms of the Nova client this would be visible as a new supported key against the --block-device flag. e.g. nova boot --block-device id=UUID,source=image,tag=database The volume attach API will similarly gain a new freeform string parameter in the ""volumeAttachment"" data dict, named ""tag"". In terms of the Nova client this would be visible as a new flag. e.g. nova volume-attach --tag=database INSTANCE-ID VOLUME-ID The server create API gain a new freeform string parameter in the ""network"" data dict, named ""tag"", for each virtual interface. In terms of the Nova client this would be visible as a new supported key against the --nic flag. e.g. nova boot --nic net-id=UUID,port-id=UUID,tag=database The interface attach API will similarly gain a new freeform string parameter in the ""interfaceAttachment"" data dict, named ""tag"". In terms of the Nova client this would be visible as a new flag. e.g. nova interface-attach UUID --net-id UUID --port-id UUID --tag database In all cases there will need to be validation performed to ensure that the supplied ""tag"" string is unique within the scope of (instance, device-type). ie you cannot have two NICs on the same instance with the same ""tag"", but you can have a disk and a NIC with the same ""tag"". If no tag is defined against a device, the corresponding device entry in the metadata file will not have any tags listed. Since this is intended as an end user feature, it is not considered appropriate for Nova to auto-generate tags itself. This will require a new API microversion Security impact --------------- None, this is merely providing some user metadata to the guest OS. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- There will be new fields available when specifying disks or network interfaces for virtual instances. The metadata service and cloud-init will have a new data file made available containing the user tags & address information. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Artom Lifshitz Other contributors: Daniel Berrange Work Items ---------- * Define new attribute for BlockDeviceMapping object * Define new attribute for NetworkRequest object * Define new parameters for block device in REST API(s) * Define new parameters for network requests in REST API(s) * Define a set of classes to represent the device metadata * Modify the metadata API to be able to serve the new data document * Modify the config drive generator to be able to include the new data document * Modify the libvirt driver to populate the metadata about devices that have tags present. * Modify the Nova client to allow the extra tag parameter to be provided. Dependencies ============ An external GIT repository will be created that provides a tool that is capable of parsing the Nova tag metadata and setting udev tags. This is not strictly a dependency, but a highly desirable feature to facilite the use of this tag information from Linux guests. Cloud-init will be enhanced to invoke this tool when it finds the JSON tag metadata is available from Nova. Testing ======= Tempest tests will create a guest with various NICs and disks, assign tags to them, and then check the guest facing metadata file is present and contains sensible data. NB, the actual data it contains will vary according to the hypervisor running the tests, so care will need to be taken to ensure any test is portable. Documentation Impact ==================== The API documentation will need to be updated to list the new tag parameter that is allowed against disk and network devices The user documentation for cloud-init will need to describe the newly available metadata file and its semantics.

1. What is the problem?
In the Tricircle, each tenant is bound to multiple pods,
where it creates various types of resources. However such a binding
relationship should be dynamic instead of static. For instance when
some resources in a pod are exhausted, tenant needs to be bound to a
new pod in same AZ.

2. What is the solution to the problem?
To deal with the above problem, the Tricircle dynamically bind tenants
to pod which has available resources. We call this feature dynamic pod
binding, which is explained in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/306224/
in detail. In this patch, we only try to binds a tenant to a pod
dynamically, when she tries to create a VM.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle to realize
the solution?
When a tenant creates a VM, the Tricircle first selects all available
pods for her. Then by filtering and weighing the pods, the Tricircle
selects the most suitable pod for the tenant. Next, the Tricircle query
database for current binding relationship of the tenant. If the tenant
is not bound to any pod, we create a new binding relationship, which
binds the tenant to the selected pod. If the tenant is already bound to
a pod, and the pod is not the pod selected by the Tricircle, we update
current binding relationship, which binds the tenant to a new pod. If
the tenant is already bound to a pod, and the pod is exactly the pod
selected by the Tricircle, the Tricircle does noting.

puppet-openstack-integration currently takes care of installing itself.
This is done through the Puppetfile which references the p-o-i repository.

This works with zuul-cloner because Zuul with ensure the current reference
is cloned.
However, when running outside of the gate, this means that p-o-i will
completely disregard any local code and instead install from the git source
specified in the Puppetfile.

The nova-extra-migrations.yml upgrade playbook in kilo ran the
`nova-manage db migrate_flavor_data` command. This command always
returns a successful return code, regardless of whether or not any

Add an upgrade playbook that runs the command with the '--force' option to help

This is part 4 of 5 patch sets which implement the Mistral
event-notification-trigger spec. This is a work in progress.

This code was demonstrated in an IBM presentation given at the Austin
OpenStack Summit in 2016 entitled 'Using OpenStack to Clean up After
Itself: Automatically Run Mistral Workflows in Response to OpenStack
Notifications'.

The event notification service is added to Mistral. It gives Mistral
the capability to listen for specific notification events on the
AMQP bus, and start workflows when those notification events are
received. To facilitate this, support was added for an event trigger.
Event triggers are created by the user, and stored in the Mistral
database. They define the events to listen for, and the workflows to
execute when the events are received. A REST API and CLI are also
provided to create, modify, and delete event triggers.

This patch adds the python Mistral client changes to support the new
event trigger REST API and CLI.

With things like VLAN support it may be necessary for
an admin to specify the sf_svip (IP) address.  The problem
is that when this is specified if the admin forgets to include
the port suffix to the SVIP address it may not work on certain
distros (inparticular RHEL variants).

This patch just adds a simple check when the endpoint is created
to make sure the port suffix is included, if it's not it
automatically adds the default 3260.

NOTE: This is not a backport, the Cheesecake code has an
inadvertent fix (albeit it could be improved) that didn't
merge in Mitaka.

It's possible to set and get custom attributes through the API, and
it's also possible to use any Unicode strings, not only ASCII range.
It works perfectly fine when accessing the API directly using
e.g. curl.

However, keystoneclient stumbles on the non-ascii keys because
it tries to set this as an attribute for the resource class and fails
because Python 2.7 does not support non-ascii identifiers:

This patch adds a functional test to demonstrate that there's
no need to handle the resync in the trunk driver, since the ovs

wait_for_backup_status() is just a wrapper method, and a service
client module is not a good place to keep the method as a stable
interface.
This patch moves wait_for_backup_status into common place.

Partially implements blueprint consistent-service-method-names

The Simple Query functionality provides simple filtering on several fields of the *Sample* type. Complex Query provides the possibility to specify queries with logical and comparison operators on the fields of *Sample*. You may also apply filters based on the values of one or more of the *resource_metadata* field, which you can identify by using *metadata.<field>* syntax in either type of query. Note, however, that given the free-form nature of *resource_metadata* field, there is no practical or consistent way to validate the query fields under *metadata* domain like it is done for all other fields. .. note:: The API call will return HTTP 200 OK status for both of the following cases: when a query with *metadata.<field>* does not match its value, and when *<field>* itself does not exist in any of the records being queried. Simple Query ++++++++++++ Many of the endpoints above accept a query filter argument, which should be a list of Query data structures. Whatever the endpoint you want to apply a filter on, you always filter on the fields of the *Sample* type (for example, if you apply a filter on a query for statistics, you won't target *duration_start* field of *Statistics*, but *timestamp* field of *Sample*). See :ref:`api-queries` for how to query the API. .. autotype:: panko.api.controllers.v2.base.Query :members: Event Query +++++++++++ Event query is similar to simple query, its type EventQuery is actually a subclass of Query, so EventQuery has every attribute Query has. But there are some differences. If a field is one of the following: event_type, message_id, start_timestamp, end_timestamp, then this field will be applied on event, otherwise it will be treated as trait name and applied on trait. See :ref:`api-queries` for how to query the API.",1,41

1. What is the problem
To connect bottom routers in different pods, we need to create
bridge networks and subnets. These networks and subnets are not
deleted after bottom routers are deleted.

2. What is the solution to the problem
Clean these bridge networks and subnets during top router deletion.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle
   to realize the solution
Bridge networks and subnets now can be cleaned up.

- Is the library actively maintained?

Latest version is 10.3.5.0.1 released on 2016-08-08. Maintainers
are responsive in #dogtag-pki on freenode.
Also RedHat is using it for the ""Red Hat Certificate System"" product.

I haven't looked into the code in detail but is has a testsuite (using tox
and pytest). In general, the code looks good to me.

Yes

- Is the library license compatible?

License is LGPLv3+ which is compatible.
Note: The library was relicensed *because* of the OpenStack license
requirements.

- Is the library already packaged in the distros we target (Ubuntu
latest / Fedora latest)?

Ubuntu:
Not yet. But given that it's a common python package it shouldn't be hard to
package it for Ubuntu.

Fedora:
Not yet. But given that it's a common python package it shouldn't be hard to
package it for Fedora.

Note: Both (Ubuntu and Fedora) have the server part of dogtag already packaged.

- Is the function of this library already covered by other libraries
in ``global-requirements.txt``?

No.

- Is the library required for OpenStack project or related dev or
infrastructure setup? (Answer to this should be Yes, of course)
Which?

Yes. It's used for the dogtag Barbican plugin.

The Cinder v3 API was marked CURRENT in Mitaka, but there no API ref
was ever created.  This is problematic for end users and would hinder
the v3 API from being included in DefCore Interoperability Guidelines
somewhere down the line (since one of DefCore's Criteria[1] is that a
Capability be well documented).  This patch creates an API ref for v3.
It also adds a header to the v2 index to show that it is SUPPORTED,
whereas v3 is CURRENT.

This patch fixes an issue where template VLUNs are left
behind during a detach.  This can happen when a volume is
exported via multiple ports to support multipath and at
detach time one of those paths becomes inactive, bad nic,
pulled cable, etc.

The 3PAR inactive VLUNs are actually templates.  When you
delete a template VLUN, all active VLUNs associated with
that template are also removed.  This patch deletes
template VLUNs at detach time.

Since the replication v2.1 has been implemented, the old implementation
of replication v2.0 and before should be erased from the code.

However, the code related to replication_driver_data and
replication_extended_status are left untouched, since it has got
a lot of code from different drivers involved and it needs to
reach an agreement with different drivers.

Log statemet is logged twice for SessionClient or HTTPClient because
logging.basicConfig() call is adding StreamHandler to root logger and
as propagate attribute of logger object is by default True the log
messgae will also be logged by the handlers of the ancestors loggers.

For a fix, removed logging.basicConfig() call.

There are two types of iSCSI multipath devices.

 type1) shares the same iqn between multiple portals.
 type2) used ifferent iqns on different portals.

In case of type1, client can found out which
target is correct by iqn stored in iscsi_properties,
so it's unnecessary to connect to all of the targets
which discovered.

This patch fixes it back up by checking the new volumes type info for
QoS settings after clone.

As we go adding more and more OVOs it becomes clear that we have quite a
lot of code duplication, and this patch tries to address some of those
cases.

This patch creates default create, save, and destroy methods in
CinderPersistentObject removing duplicated code and reducing code
required for new OVOs, as only code for special cases will be required.

As a side effect of the refactoring we get a small speed improvement on
get_by_id method on the first call of each OVO.

Currently, if admin user wants to list all volume types,
he had to specify a weird option to /types API
as follows:
/types?is_public=None

It's not easy to understand by end user, so we'd
better to let /types list all public and non-public
types while is_public option is not specified.
And let /types?is_public=False return all non-public ones,
/types?is_public=True list all public ones.

Any proposed code change in gerrit is automatically rejected by the OpenStack Jenkins server [#f1]_ if the change causes test failures. It is recommended for developers to run the test suite before submitting patch for review. This allows to catch errors as early as possible. Preferred way to run the tests ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The preferred way to run the unit tests is using ``tox``. It executes tests in isolated environment, by creating separate virtualenv and installing dependencies from the ``requirements.txt`` and ``test-requirements.txt`` files, so the only package you install is ``tox`` itself: .. code-block:: console $ pip install tox See `the unit testing section of the Testing wiki page`_ for more information. Following are some simple examples. To run the Python 2.7 tests: .. code-block:: console $ tox -e py27 To run the style tests: .. code-block:: console $ tox -e pep8 To run multiple tests separate items by commas: .. code-block:: console $ tox -e py27,py34,pep8 .. _the unit testing section of the Testing wiki page: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Testing#Unit_Tests Running a subset of tests ------------------------- Instead of running all tests, you can specify an individual directory, file, class or method that contains test code, i.e. filter full names of tests by a string. To run the tests located only in the ``kolla_kubernetes/tests`` directory use: .. code-block:: console $ tox -e py27 kolla_kubernetes.tests To run the tests of a specific file say ``kolla_kubernetes/tests/test_utils.py`: .. code-block:: console $ tox -e py27 test_utils To run the tests in the ``TestJinjaUtils`` class in the ``kolla_kubernetes/tests/test_utils.py`` file: .. code-block:: console $ tox -e py27 test_utils.TestJinjaUtils To run the ``TestJinjaUtils.test_merge_configs_and_self_render`` test method in the ``kolla_kubernetes/tests/test_utils.py``` file: .. code-block:: console $ tox -e py27 test_kolla_docker.ModuleArgsTest.test_module_args Debugging unit tests ------------------------ In order to break into the debugger from a unit test we need to insert a breaking point to the code: .. code-block:: python import pdb; pdb.set_trace() Then run ``tox`` with the debug environment as one of the following:: tox -e debug tox -e debug test_file_name.TestClass.test_name For more information see the `oslotest documentation <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslotest/features.html#debugging-with-oslo-debug-helper>`_. .. rubric:: Footnotes ..

Fixed miscellaneous errors dealing with the state of Dell's
Live Volumes after a LV AFO event.

Was looking for the original volume and sc server object
after the primary was down. We now look for the new primary

Ensure export was failing to properly kick off a swap
back to the original primary if it was available.

Fixed an error with deleting replications.

Neutron security group API accepts name or integer as protocol.
e.g. ""tcp"" or ""6""
Neutron keeps adding protocol names for more human readability.
It's, however, troublesome for OpenDaylight to catch up those protocol
names. So networking-odl should convert protocol name unknown to
OpenDaylight to integer because this conversion can be easily done
in neutron. It's because neutron already knows it.
Although it's possible to always convert protocol name to integer,
this isn't done because of compatibility.

This depends on OpenDaylight patch which was already merged.

The belongsTo query parameter is only supported by the v2.0
token validation API. It would check the ID of the project passed
to the belongsTo parameter against the project a token was scoped to.

This commit corrects the implementation, tests, and adds
documentation. It also moves the check to keystone.token.controller
since belongsTo is a v2-ism and doesn't belong in the
keystone.token.provider.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================== Manila Access Groups ==================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/manila/+spec/access-groups Access Groups is a mechanism, by which a set of 'ip addresses/users/certs' can be considered as 'one entity' i.e. can be allowed the access to a share together. Henceforth, the 'same set of ip addresses', can be allowed access to any 'other share', in 'one single request' from user. Problem description =================== Currently, we use ""manila allow-access"" and ""manila deny-access"" cli command, to allow and deny one ip-address/user/cert the access to a particular share. We have to execute 'allow-access' for each combination of(IP address, share) one by one. That's cumbersome, hence access-groups were proposed. Use cases ========= In situation, when we want a share to be accessible by a subnet OR a set of IP addresses together OR a set users together In that case access-group implementation will be useful. Access group can be asked to be ""a union of previously formed access groups"". An access group can contain all rules of two or more access-groups that were formed earlier. A group can include other groups. With later enhancements, access-group should be able to refer to external entities like neutron security group or lets say a set of nova instances. There should be a provision to say ""allow access of this share to a nova instance uuid"", wherein uuid is associated with an ip address. Proposed change =============== A new object named 'access_group', can be created by user. Each 'access_group' contains, a bunch of homogeneous 'access_group_entries'. Homogeneous here means, 'entries of same access_type & access_level(in case access_type is 'user'))'. Each 'access_entry' represents, either one ip - address or one username. Bunch of access entries, associated to an ""access-group"", can be ""allowed or denied"" access, to a share in one go. The CLI would look like: 1. Access Group: manila access-group-create [--access-level <access_level> ] <name> <description> <access_type> manila access-group-delete <access_group_id> 2. Access Group Entries: manila access-group-entry-create <access_to> <access_group_id> manila access-group-entry-delete <access_group_entry_id> 3. Access Group Mapping: manila access-group-allow <share> <access_group_id> manila access-group-deny <share> <access_group_id> **Challenges with proposed approach** With proposed approach, a set of access - rules can be applied together using ""access-group"". Earlier ""allow-access/deny-access"" api worked on individual access rule. So, the earlier api can interfere and allow/deny any access, without any knowledge of access - group api. Hence, a parallel api interface, serving same purpose, but in different granularity, causes redundancy in database and information. In proposed approach, we are sending a bunch of rules together to backend, if any one rule throws an exception, status of whole access - group will be errored. If backend driver doesn't implement 'update_access' newer version yet, then 'access-rules' will be sent to driver one by one only. Though 'access-group' feature will allow user, to request access, to set of ip addresses, in one go, still backend will work on access - rules individually. **Alternative Approach - 2** This approach suggests to tag/group already present records in 'share_access_map table by using a new field 'access_group_tag'. Here we do not create a separate entity 'access_group' and 'access_group_entries'. Instead, by using a string type tag with each of share_access_map records, we ""group"" a few entries together. For the first share, that wants to allow a group of ip addresses/user the access. CLI will be as below: - manila access-allow %some_share% ip 1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, 3.3.3.3 --tag %tag_name_1% After that any share that wants similar access will do either - manila access-inherit %some_new_share% --by-share %some_source_share% OR - manila access -inherit %some_new_share%--by-tag %tag% **Impact of approach - 2** 1. This approach is lighter and less amount of redundancy in database as compared to 1st approach. Access-group, being dynamic entity in 2nd approach/not an independent entity, which has its 'existence scope', same as the share, its associated with. So, no further means to deal with 'access-groups', independently OR after share deletion. 2. Lets say, 'share1' is applied with set of access-rules tagged as 'AG1'. if 'share2' inherits all access_rules from 'share1'. If 'share1' adds a new rule by old 'allow-access' api. We can tackle such situation by keeping this new individual access_rule record without tag. Now, the next share 'share3' that inherits with --share from 'share1', will get all rules inclusive (share1, with tag) and (share1, without tag). But, if the next share 'share3' that inherits with --tag 'AG1' will get rules which is with ('share1', AG1). 3. If the share is deleted and if it's last share which was associated with an access-group, the access-group is considered deleted. 4. If a share 'share1' has allowed access to 3 ip addresses tagged with 'AG1', now another 'share2' inherited all 3 rules with 'AG1' tag itself. If using old api 'deny-access' request comes, to delete one of the rule with share1. Now, access-group with 'AG1' tag - has got two separate set of access-rules, defining its members. - one that's coming from share1(2 rules) - other that's coming from share2(3 rules). Now, If a 'share3' is asking for rules same as tag 'AG1', rules to be applied on it is still a thought. 5. Lets say 'share1' has 3 rules, 'share2' inherits from access-rules of 'share1'. Now, If there is a change in access-rules of 'share1' for some reason, after that point 'share1' and 'share2' will have different set of access-rule mapping. We can not trigger update on child shares(share2) as we are not keeping this parent child share mapping anywhere. 6. As access-group tag definition is not static and is not kept independently. Now, With a large deployment and after many iterations of allow/deny, this becomes hard for someone to remember, which share has what access - group tagging and what a tag composed of? **Conclusion Approach - 2** A group / A tag can not have a static definition(set of rules) among all these allow / deny of different sorts. **Alternative Approach - 3** Actually, As a tag doesn't have a individual independent identity, we can think of ""NOT"" providing, --tag the interface, to inherit from. - manila access-inherit %some_new_share% --by-tag %tag% (Lets NOT have it) - manila access-inherit %some_new_share% --by-share %some_source_share% (Lets ""only"" have this) There should be only api to inherit access from a share. In such a case, we will allow, for first share like this - manila access-allow %some_share% ip 1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, 3.3.3.3 we will create multiple access-records, for the share, in share_access_map table, without any tagging. Next, a share, who wants similar access-scope, will do - manila access-inherit %some_new_share% --by-share %some_source_share% This solves the problem associated with tagging and trying to keep a static definition of a tag. This solves the problem of redundancy, as present in 1st approach. This has same problem, as in 2nd approach, of ""not having an access - group after share-deletion"". Once a share share1, has got a set of rules, it can be inherited by another share and rules-set that's inherited, will be set of rules, associated ""at that very moment"" with share1. Things are dynamic. At some other moment in time, some share might inherit separate set of rules, from same share, 'share1'. There will be no such api deny-access-rules where we can just say, deny group of rules, which we gave access together. Deny-access will be similar to manila access-deny %some_share% ip 1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, 3.3.3.3 - Selecting First Approach for Implementation Data model impact ----------------- Three new tables will be

The db migration tests use a bunch of setup inside oslo_db that is
only exported as a base test class. This means that none of these do
the standard setup that the rest of the Nova tests do, including
things like logging capture.

Long term, the relationship between nova and oslo_db needs to be fixed
so that these are available as fixtures, not just base class. However,
in the short term we can setup logging correctly before initializing
the rest of the test class to keep these from scrambling the test

os_vif.initialize() was previously executed during module load. This
means it was entirely possible that it was run before things like
logging were actually set up in the expected way. Move this back into
execution time instead of load time to ensure that logging is actually
setup.

Changes need to be made to tests which make assumptions about os_vif
objects to manually initialize os_vif when it will be used. os_vif
objects can't be created until it is initialized, so some delayed
object creation is also done in test_vif.py.

Closes-Bug: #1615676

Recent changes to the placement API added more verbose logging and
output across both stdout and stderr. In test runs this resulted in
a combination of far too much output as well as output that was
impossible to read because it was interleaved.

This change uses fixtures from nova.tests.fixtures to capture
stray output streams and logs.

It also adds a specific logger for the ERROR level that overrides
the fixture log handling to send that level to the default stderr.
This is required in order to effectively see error messages on both
side of the wsgi-intercept used when running gabbi. Without this,
the errors are swallowed and test development and debugging,
especially locally for TDD, is hamstrung.

the project. Tenacity is a fork of retrying, but has improved the

After I found this problem appear in ""volume unset"",
I checked all the volume command and also found some
same problems. This patch fix them all.
The main reason of we ignored this problem before is
there was not any tests for it. So I add tests for
""nothing unset"" for them all to test and aviod this

Also, I add unit tests for all snapshot commands

need more tests to avoid some ignored problem.

Align puppet-tripleo with other Puppet OpenStack modules to use
puppet-openstack_spec_helper.

Here are the benefits:

- Allow to use Depends-On between Puppet OpenStack modules and
  puppet-tripleo, and unit tests will work correctly with dependencies.
- Use the Puppet OpenStack gemspec file that handle gems dependencies to
  test the module.
- Allow to re-use ruby helper that Puppet OpenStack modules have in unit
  tests, to avoid duplicated code.
- Don't manage .fixtures.yml file, it will be generated by Puppet
  OpenStack tooling. TripleO dependencies will live in Puppetfile_extras.

The cause of failing unit tests is a bug in huawei driver.
When huawei driver logins to backend, it reads username/password from
huawei configuration file. If the username/password are configured as
plain text, huawei driver'll encode them and overwrite the encoded text
to the configuration file.

The encoding logic code is like this:
  six.text_type(base64.b64encode(""***""))

For py27, this code works fine. However, for py34, this text_type
converting adds some extra words to result unicode string, like
""b'***'""('***' is the actual encoded result string).
Once driver reads the username/password again, it'll get the incorrect
text and then fail while jsonutils.dumps.

All the failed unit tests tried to call login twice, and triggered the
error condition said above.

This patch is just a workaround, because those failed tests actually
no need to login twice, the redundant login calls are removed.

Another patch will be commited to fix the problem thoroughly in huawei
driver.  Bug https://launchpad.net/bugs/1612149 has been raised for
that work, and will also analyze what changed to trigger this issue
only recently.

This change explicitly adds the FSID to the $cluster_option variable
and causes Puppet to exit if OSD preparation/activation will fail
because the OSD belongs to a different Ceph cluster as determined by
an FSID mismatch. FSID mismatch is a symptom of attempting to install
over another deploy. The FSID mismatch failure will be logged so that
the user may determine the reason for failure and then choose to zap
away the old deploy away before re-attempting deployment.

This patch adds a new option in undercloud.conf: pre_upgrade.

If set to True (default so our users can upgrade undercloud it out of the box),
it will run some actions required to before Puppet run.
Those actions are now:
- stop openstack-* services
- stop neutron-* services
They are required now because otherwise Puppet catalog will hang on
restarting services later during the upgrade process.
Instead of doing it in tripleoclient, let's do it here.

The revision number is bumped on the flush that changes
the port or a resource that bumps the port. However, in ML2
we create the dict that is used for after_update events,
mech driver calls, and the API response before all resource
modifications are complete so the dict may not reflect
the correct revision number.

This adjusts the update_port_status to flush changes to the
DB before constructing the dictionary response to give the
event listener a chance to bump the revision.

It also adjusts ML2 to update the 'updated_port' dict with
the latest result from make_port_dict after all of the related
objects have been processed to ensure the result has the latest
info from extensions. The API test for allowed address pairs
was adjusted to stop checking for order on update since no order
is stored in the DB.

The API test for revision numbers and ports was updated to
expect the correct behavior.

The test cases were asserting bad behavior by the way the
test driver was designed. Rather than ensuring that the extension
was extending the resource in each case with the correct value,
it was asserting that different values came back from

inconsistency which interferred with the dependent patch.

This patch fixes that by having the extension store the values requested
in the API and then use those same values for extending the result
whether it be for updates, creates, or shows.

Win32 API functions will be invoked, by default, using tpool.execute
when called from within a greenthread, ensuring that other
greenthreads are not blocked.

This workflow will not be applied to Win32 API functions that are
known to always return quickly, in which case this wouldn't bring

Since current scenario implementation transforms method to class at runtime,
it is reasonable to have class-based scenario implementation which will be
much simpler to use behind the scenes.

This class should be based on Scenario and do not break compatibility.
The only required method is run() which is actually a body of scenario.

The cause of failing unit tests is a bug in huawei driver.
When huawei driver logins to backend, it reads username/password from
huawei configuration file. If the username/password are configured as
plain text, huawei driver'll encode them and overwrite the encoded text
to the configuration file.

The encoding logic code is like this:
  six.text_type(base64.b64encode(""***""))

For py27, this code works fine. However, for py34, this text_type
converting adds some extra words to result unicode string, like
""b'***'""('***' is the actual encoded result string).
Once driver reads the username/password again, it'll get the incorrect
text and then fail while jsonutils.dumps.

All the failed unit tests tried to call login twice, and triggered the
error condition said above.

This patch is just a workaround, because those failed tests actually
no need to login twice, the redundant login calls are removed.

Another patch will be commited to fix the problem thoroughly in huawei
driver.  Bug https://launchpad.net/bugs/1612149 has been raised for
that work, and will also analyze what changed to trigger this issue
only recently.

Neutron keyston v3 support is on-going [1].
From ODL perspective, it's simply variable rename from 'tenant_id'
to 'project_id'.
For ODL compatibility, populate json value for ODL neutron northbound
with both 'project_id' and 'tenant_id'.
Since ODL Neutron Northbound silently ignores unknown fields (more
precisely, Java jaxb does), it won't harm to have extra fields unknown
to ODL neutron northbound.

Ansible 2.1.1 introduces a regression in the way conditional
includes are handled which results in every task in the
included file being evaluated even if the condition for the

This patch forces all conditional includes to be dynamic.

1. What is the problem
Before creating bottom subnet, we need to create some ports to
allocate ip address for bottom dhcp port and bottom gateway port.
These pre-created ports are not deleted after bottom resources
are deleted.

2. What is the solution to the problem
Clean these pre-created ports during top subnet deletion.

3. What the features need to be implemented to the Tricircle
   to realize the solution
Pre-created ports now can be cleaned up.

The null key for credential encryption tests certain encryption
behavior when a key repository doesn't exist locally. If you were
to run these tests locally with a key repository created in the
default location (`/etc/keystone/credential-keys`) the tests would
fail.

This commit makes the null key tests override the key_repository location in

ovn-controller stores the datapath type and supported interface
types of the host in the external_ids column of the chassis table.

When the bind_port() function is called, this patch determines the
vif_type by reading these values from the chassis row where the port is to
be bound.

If the value of datapath type is 'netdev' and has 'dpdkvhostuser' in

At the moment, if the device path was found, we are not performing
any rescan.

This can cause issues if we retrieve the device path before it was

At the moment, the instance snapshot operation is synchronized using
the instance uuid. This was added some time ago, as the instance
destroy operation was failing when an instance snapshot was in
proggress.

This is now causing a deadlock, as a similar lock was recently
introduced in the manager for the shelve operation by this change:
Id36b3b9516d72d28519c18c38d98b646b47d288d

We can safely remove the lock from the HyperV driver as we now stop
pending jobs when destroying instances.

We are replacing all usages of the 'retrying' package with
'tenacity' as the author of retrying is not actively maintaining
the project. Tenacity is a fork of retrying, but has improved the
interface and extensibility (see [1] for more details). Our end
goal here is removing the retrying package from our requirements.

Tenacity provides the same functionality as retrying, but has the
following major differences to account for:
- tenacity uses seconds rather than ms as retrying did.
- tenacity has different kwargs for the decorator and
Retrying class itself.
- tenacity has a different approach for retrying args by
using classes for its stop/wait/retry kwargs.
- By default tenacity raises a RetryError if a retried callable
times out; retrying raises the last exception from the callable.
Tenacity provides backwards compatibility here by offering
the 'reraise' kwarg.
- tenacity defines 'time.sleep' as a default value for a kwarg.
That said consumers who need to mock patch time.sleep
need to account for this via mocking of time.sleep before
tenacity is imported.

This patch updates all usages of retrying with tenacity.
Unit tests will be added where applicable.

Note: This change is not newton critical so projects are welcome
to hold off on committing until post-newton. Ideally this change
will merge by the first part of Ocata so dependant functionality
can land and have time to solidify for Ocata.

The resize operation fails while using the Cluster Driver because
the new resized instance is never added back to the cluster.

At the moment, in order to migrate a clustered VM, we move the
according cluster resource group using the MoveToNewNodeParams WMI
method. This method accepts an undocumented 'Parameters' argument,
which is then passed to the underlying MoveClusterGroupEx clusapi.dll
function.

While the latter expects a property list as described at the following
link, we were passing the desired migration type directly.
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa371809(v=vs.85).aspx

This worked on Windows Server 2012R2 but is causing issues on WS 2016.
Resource group end up hanging in a 'Pending' state.

This change addresses this issue by using clusapi.dll functions directly,
as the according WMI methods are not working, throwing a generic error
even though the VMs are migrated properly.

Win32 API functions will be invoked, by default, using tpool.execute
when called from within a greenthread, ensuring that other
greenthreads are not blocked.

This workflow will not be applied to Win32 API functions that are
known to always return quickly, in which case this wouldn't bring
any benefit.

When a node gets new name nailgun renames log directory which had name
in form of <IP> to <node name> and then creates symlink <IP> ->
<node name>. The problem is that node is still active at this moment
and sends some logs to syslog on master node. So when we renamed <IP>
to <node name> and haven't created symlink name syslog may find
missing log dir and it creates it again in this case. Then nailgun
tries to create symlink and fails.

To avoid this situation this patch adds attempts to remove a directory
and create symlink until symlink will being successfully created.

Approach used in master does not work in <=8.0. In MOS=<8.0 nailgun
and rsyslog work in different PID namespaces and can not interact
with each other by signals.

Currently debugging the dynamic inventory file can be problematic,
requiring manual intervention with a debugger to step through function
calls and inspect data structures.

This patch adds a logging facility for outputting detailed debug logs.
The output is not intended for end users, and will not be called by
Ansible runs. Rather, it is meant for running manually to aid

The VMware Nova driver uses the volume reference in vCenter
which is passed in the connection info to identify the volume
during attach and detach. If the vCenter inventory is restored
from a backup using backup solutions such as HP data protector,
the volume reference in vCenter may change, but the volume name

Currently, there are 3 statuses for qos:
  - 'active', 'inactivated' and 'idle'

If qos status is 'idle', the qos deletion will fail because
huawei driver doesn't deactivate it before deleting.

This change fixes this bug by deactivating qos first if qos
status is not 'inactivated'.

Raise threshold on when we remove partially translated files from 20 per

75 per cent.

We agreed in the past that files with less than 60 per cent

dns.zone.exists was erroneously added to the list of designate
notifications when it was first written. If we are to listen to
.exists notifications we should do it across the board and make
it configurable; the benefit of it is to act as an auditing system
but if things are working properly it should not be necessary.

In a previous patch I updated Zuul Layout to reflect our desire to run
Puppet 4 tests in the gate instead of Puppet 3 for current master and
future stable/newton.
In the change, I forgot to update some other rules that were applied
later in the layout.

This patch does 3 things:
- Bring all layout related to puppet jobs together, so it's easier to
  read.
- Do not run Puppet 3 Xenial jobs, we don't want it. We started to
  support Puppet4 from now, we want to gate on it.
- Run Puppet 4 for experimental scenario004 job. Puppet 3 is not
  wanted anymore.

In order to make the 'admin' role more sensible, keystone added a
header to authentication responses X_IS_ADMIN_PROJECT indicating
whether or not a request was authenticated against the administrative
project (in devstack, this is configured to be the 'admin' project).

This patch adds support for the header. It defaults to True if the
header is not set, in accordance with other projects, for the reason
that older keystone deployments (or those where this feature is not
enabled) would otherwise not be useable.

The header is configured by admin_project_name and
admin_project_domain_name in keystone's keystone.conf. If these are
set, a request with the admin role against a non-admin project should
no longer be able to retrieve resources belonging to other tenants even
if all_projects is set. If the keystone options are *not* set, then
all admin-role requests will be able to retrieve resources belonging to
other tenants.

Recently there was some confusion caused by the fact the gabbi tests
used by the placement API have names like this:

    gabbi.suitemaker.test_placement_api_usage_create_provider

This means that the names cannot be matched against tox interactions
like:

    tox -efunctional -- nova.tests.functional.api.openstack

This change makes it so the tests are generated with names like:

    nova.tests.functional.api.openstack.placement.test_placement_api.usage_create_provider

So this change is submitted for review if people care. The other
option is to:

    tox -efunctional placement

gabbi was updated to allow this functionality in a clean form, so
this depends on a change to global requirements but can work
without it if required.

This patch moves the keystone::auth settings for all
services into the new service_config_settings section. This
is important because we execute the keystone commands via
puppet only on the role containing the keystone service
and without these settings it will fail.

Note that yaql merging/filtering is used here to ensure that
service_config_settings is optional in service templates,
and also that we'll only deploy hieradata for a given
service on a node running the service (the key in
the service_config_settings map must match the service_name
in the service template for this to work).

e.g the following will result in only deploying keystone: 123
in hiera on the role running the ""keystone"" service,
regardless of which service template defines it.

  service_config_settings:
    keystone:
      keystone: 123

We are currently wasting about 10 minutes per deploy waiting for
DHCP on interfaces that will never get it.  By default, the timeout
seems to be 5 minutes (the 10 minutes is because we boot both the
IPA ramdisk and the deployed image, and each waits for 5 minutes),
which is excessively long to get a DHCP response.  This change
shortens the time to 30 seconds.  If an interface hasn't gotten a
response in 30 seconds, chances are it's not going to.  A 30
second wait should reduce our wasted time to 1 minute, which is
more reasonable.

This is being done in the systemd unit file because the -timeout
option to dhclient doesn't seem to override what is configured in
dhclient.conf, and doing it in the systemd file means that this
change will be limited to only the interfaces configured by
dhcp-all-interfaces.

The revision number is bumped on the flush that changes
the port or a resource that bumps the port. However, in ML2
we create the dict that is used for after_update events,
mech driver calls, and the API response before all resource
modifications are complete so the dict may not reflect
the correct revision number.

This adjusts the update_port_status to flush changes to the
DB before constructing the dictionary response to give the
event listener a chance to bump the revision.

It also adjusts ML2 to update the 'updated_port' dict with
the latest result from make_port_dict after all of the related
objects have been processed to ensure the result has the latest
info from extensions. The API test for allowed address pairs
was adjusted to stop checking for order on update since no order
is stored in the DB.

The API test for revision numbers and ports was updated to
expect the correct behavior.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =============================== HugePages per guest NUMA nodes =============================== Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/virt-hugepages-per-guest-numa-nodes This spec is intended to extend the existing spec ""Virt driver large page allocation for guest RAM"" to configure different page size per guest NUMA nodes. Problem description =================== By allocating huge pages, performance is increased since fewer pages are needed, and therefore less TLB misses, which reduce the time it takes to translate a virtual page address to a physical page address. Without hugepages, high TLB miss rates would occur with the standard 4k page size, slowing performance. Use Cases --------- In some workloads related to NFV and realtime for Nova, users might have the requirement to configure different pagesize per guest NUMA nodes for best performance. Proposed change =============== Since selecting different page size per guest NUMA nodes is strongly dependant of the image running on the guest there is no need of supporting any new attribute in the flavor extra spec. However, a new Glance image property 'hw_numa_mem_page_size' is going to be added that lets users specify NUMA nodes ID. E.g: hw_numa_mem_page_size.NUMA_NODE_ID = small|large|any|{custom} Considering specify the page size to a guest NUMA nodes requires to have the flavor configured to specifically enable huge pages support and NUMA nodes. The 'hw:numa_node' defines the number of guest NUMA nodes requested, in that context it can't be less than 2. The 'hw:mem_page_size' option will be used to explicitly authorize using hugepages support and set the default page size of each guest NUMA nodes if some of them are not defined by the new option introduced. flavor: hw:numa_node = 4 hw:mem_page_size = small image: hw_numa_mem_page_size.0 = 1GiB hw_numa_mem_page_size.1 = 2048KiB hw_numa_mem_page_size.3 = large In that example the NUMA node 0 is going to request 1GiB hugepages size, the NUMA node 1 is going to request 2MiB hugepages size, the NUMA node 2 is going to request the smallest page size avalabile on the host (4KiB for x86 arch) and the NUMA node 3 the largest hugepages size available. Alternatives ------------ An alternative for libvirt driver would be to alter the domain XML of running instance to specify the page size of bakend memory per NUMA nodes. Data model impact ----------------- * The Instance NUMA (InstanceNUMA) object already defines a list of Instance NUMA Cell (InstanceNUMACell) objects which each defines a page size attribute. No change are expected in that data model. * The Image Meta Properties (ImageMetaProps) object will be enchanced by a new property 'hw_numa_mem_page_size' defined as a dictionary of integers (DictOfIntegersField). REST API impact --------------- No impact. The existing APIs already support arbitrary data in the flavour extra specs. Security impact --------------- No impact. Notifications impact -------------------- No impact Other end user impact --------------------- There are no changes that directly impact the end user, other than the fact that their guest should now be able to request a different page size per NUMA nodes. Performance Impact ------------------ The scheduler will have more logic added to take into account large page availability per NUMA node when placing guests. Other deployer impact --------------------- Most of this impact will have already been incurred when large pages support is enabled for Nova. Developer impact ---------------- No impact except for the fact that a logic to set page size per guest NUMA nodes is going to be added. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: <sahid-ferdjaoui> Other contributors: <berrange> Work Items ---------- * Enhance image property to take into account hw_numa_mem_page_size * Enhance NUMATopologyFilter to place instance on host according page size on NUMA nodes available on host. * Enhance libvirt driver to configure guest based on the hugepages request. * Integrate functional tests to verify memory allocated for guests. Dependencies ============ * http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/juno/approved/virt-driver-large-pages.html Testing ======= Testing this in the gate would be difficult since the hosts which run the gate tests would have to be pre-configured with large pages allocated at initial OS boot time. This in turn would preclude running gate tests with guests that do not want to use large pages. Documentation Impact ==================== All the requirement for using large pages are applied? the new image property needs to be documented along with recommendations about effective usage.

The auth plugin was not loading when called from the CLI due to the
mismatch of variable argument parameter calling convention.  This was
due in part to not specfying the parameters properly in the plugin, and
also due to extending from the wrong base class.

Ansible 2.1.1 introduces a regression in the way conditional
includes are handled which results in every task in the
included file being evaluated even if the condition for the

This patch forces all conditional includes to be dynamic.

Switching to active management by the charm of /etc/hosts
resulted in a number of race conditions during cluster
formation as a nasty side effect.

Revert changes to the charm related to this switch, as charm
versions prior to these changes are far more reliable to
