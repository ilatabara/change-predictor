The bootstrap-aio.sh script generates a password by reading a set number
of characters from urandom then removing those that aren't alphanumeric.
The problem with this is that its possible for 0 characters to remain.

This patch changes the order so that tr (translate) reads urandom
directly and removes non alphanumeric characters then that output is
truncated to the required length. This ensures the generated password is
always the desired length.

Currently each service has an individual service_region var

This patch implements a user_group_var called 'service_region'

See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License. Actions ======= An action is an abstraction of some logic that can be executed by a worker thread. Most of the operations supported by Senlin are executed asynchronously, which means they are queued into database and then picked up by certain worker thread for execution. Currently, Senlin only supports builtin actions listed below. In future, we may evolve to support user-defined actions (UDAs). A user-defined action may carry a Shell script to be executed on a target Nova server, or a Heat SoftwareConfig to be deployed on a stack, for example. The following builtin actions are supported at the time of this design: - ``CLUSTER_CREATE``: An action for creating a cluster; - ``CLUSTER_DELETE``: An action for deleting a cluster; - ``CLUSTER_UPDATE``: An action for updating a cluster; - ``CLUSTER_ADD_NODES``: An action for adding existing nodes to a cluster; - ``CLUSTER_DEL_NODES``: An action for removing nodes from a cluster; - ``CLUSTER_RESIZE``: An action for adjusting the size of a cluster; - ``CLUSTER_SCALE_IN``: An action to shrink the size of a cluster; - ``CLUSTER_SCALE_OUT``: An action to extend the size of a cluster; - ``CLUSTER_ATTACH_POLICY``: An action to attach a policy to a cluster; - ``CLUSTER_DETACH_POLICY``: An action to detach a policy from a cluster; - ``CLUSTER_UPDATE_POLICY``: An action to update the properties of a binding between a cluster and a policy; - ``NODE_CREATE``: An action for creating a new node; - ``NODE_DELETE``: An action for deleting an existing node; - ``NODE_UPDATE``: An action for updating the properties of an existing node; - ``NODE_JOIN``: An action for joining a node to an existing cluster; - ``NODE_LEAVE``: An action for a node to leave its current owning cluster; - ``POLICY_ENABLE``: An action for globally enable a policy; - ``POLICY_DISABLE``: An action for globally disable a policy; - ``POLICY_UPDATE``: An action for updating the properties of a policy. ----------------- Action Properties ----------------- An action has the following properties when created: - ``id``: a globally unique ID for the action object; - ``name``: a string representation of the action name which might be generated automatically for actions derived from other operations; - ``context``: a dictionary that contains the calling context that will be used by the engine when executing the action. Contents in this dictionary may contain sensitive information such as user credentials. - ``action``: a text property that contains the action body to be executed. Currently, this property only contains the name of a builtin action. In future, we will provide a structured definition of action for UDAs. - ``target``: the UUID of an object (e.g. a cluster, a node or a policy) to be operated; - ``cause``: a string indicating the reason why this action was created. The purpose of this property for the engine to check whether a new lock should be acquired before operating an object. Valid values for this property include: * ``RPC Request``: this indicates that the action was created upon receiving a RPC request from Senlin API; * ``Derived Action``: this indicates that the action was created internally as part of the execution path of another action; - ``owner``: the UUID of a worker thread that currently ""owns"" this action and is responsible for executing it. - ``interval``: the interval (in seconds) for repetitive actions, a value of 0 means that the action won't be repeated; - ``start_time``: timestamp when the action was last started. This field is provided for action execution timeout detection; - ``stop_time``: timestamp when the action was stopped. This field is provided for measuring the execution time of an action; - ``timeout``: timeout (in seconds) for the action execution. A value of 0 means that the action does not have a customized timeout constraint, though it may still have to honor the system wide ``default_action_timeout`` setting. - ``status``: a string representation of the current status of the action. See subsection below for detailed status definitions. - ``status_reason``: a string describing the reason that has led the action to its current status. - ``control``: a string for holding the pending signals such as ``CANCEL``, ``SUSPEND`` or ``RESUME``. - ``inputs``: a dictionary that provides inputs to the action when executed; - ``outputs``: a dictionary that captures the outputs (including error messages) from the action execution; - ``depends_on``: a UUID list for the actions that must be successfully completed before the current action becomes ``READY``. An action cannot become ``READY`` when this property is not an empty string. - ``depended_by``: a UUID list for the actions that depends on the successful completion of current action. When the current action is completed with a success, the actions listed in this property will get notified. - ``created_time``: the timestamp when the action was created; - ``updated_time``: the timestamp when the action was last updated; - ``deleted_time``: the timestamp when the action was deleted. Note that a non-empty value of this property alway indicates that the action is deleted. *TODO*: Add support for scheduled action execution. *NOTE*: The default value of the ``default_action_timeout`` is 3600 seconds. The Action Data Property ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ An action object has a property named ``data`` which is used for saving policy decisions. This property is a Python dict for different policies to save and exchange policy decision data. Suppose we have a scaling policy, a deletion policy and a load-balancing policy attached to the same cluster. By design, when an ``CLUSTER_SCALE_IN`` action is picked up for execution, the following sequence will happen: 1) When the action is about to be executed, the worker thread checks all policies that have registered a ""pre_op"" on this action type. 2) Based on priority setting, the ""pre_op"" of the scaling policy is invoked, and the policy determines the number of nodes to be deleted. This decision is saved to the action's ``data`` property in the following format:: ""deletion"": { ""count"": 2 } 3) Based on the priority setting, the deletion policy is evaluated next. When the ""pre_op"" method of the deletion policy is invoked, it first checks the ``data`` property of the action where it finds out the number of nodes to delete. Then it will cacluate the list of candidates to be deleted using its selection criteria (e.g. ``OLDEST_FIRST``). Finally, it saves the candidates to the ``data`` property of the action, in the following format:: ""deletion"": { ""count"": 2, ""candidates"": [""1234-4567-9900"", ""3232-5656-1111""] } 4) According to priority setting, the load-balancing policy is evaluated last. When invoked, its ""pre_op"" method checks the ``data`` property of the action and finds out the candidate nodes to be removed from the cluster. With this information, the method removes the nodes from the load-balancer maintained by the policy. 5) The action's ``execute()`` method is now invoked and it removes the nodes as given in its ``data`` property, updates the cluster's last update timestamp, then returns. From the example above, we can see that the ``data`` property of an action plays a critical role in policy checking and enforcement. Note that there are policies that will write to the ``data`` property of a node for a similar reason. For example, a placement policy may decide where a new node should be created. This information is saved into the ``data`` property of a node. When a profile is about to create a node, it is supposed to check this property and enforce it. For a Nova server profile, this means that the profile code will inject ``scheduler_hints`` to the server instance before it is created. --------------- Action Statuses --------------- An action can be in one of the following statuses during its lifetime: - ``INIT``: Action object is being initialized, not ready for execution; - ``READY``: Action object can be picked up by any worker thread for execution; - ``WAITING``: Action object has dependencies on other actions, it may become ``READY`` only when the dependents are all completed with successes; - ``RUNNING``: Action object is being executed by a worker thread; - ``SUSPENDED``: Action object is suspended during execution, so the only way to put it back to ``RUNNING`` status is to send it a ``RESUME`` signal; - ``SUCCEEDED``: Action object has completed execution with a success; - ``FAILED``: Action object execution has been aborted due to failures; - ``CANCELLED``: Action object execution has been aborted due to a ``CANCEL`` signal. Collectively, the ``SUCCEEDED``, ``FAILED`` and ``CANCELLED`` statuses are all valid action completion status. ------------------------------------------ The ``execute()`` Method and Return Values ------------------------------------------ Each subclass of the base ``Action`` must provide an implementation of the ``execute()`` method which provides the actual logic to be invoked by the generic action execution framework. Senlin defines a protocol for the execution of actions. The ``execute()`` method should always return a tuple ``<RES>, <REASON>`` where the ``<RES>`` indicates whether the action procedure execution was a success and the ``<REASON>`` provides an explanation of the result, e.g. the error message when the execution was a failure. In this protocol, the action procedure can return one of the following values: - ``OK``: the action execution was a complete success; - ``ERROR``: the action execution has failed with error messages; - ``RETRY``: the action execution has encountered some resource competition situation, so the recommendation is to re-start the action if possible; - ``CANCEL``: the action has received a ``CANCEL`` signal and thus has aborted its execution; - ``TIMEOUT``: the action has detected a timeout error when performing some time consuming jobs. When the return value is ``OK``, the action status will be set to ``SUCCEEDED``; when the return value is ``ERROR`` or ``TIMEOUT``, the action status will be set to ``FAILED``; when the return value is ``CANCEL``, the action status will be set to ``CANCELLED``; finally, when the return value is ``RETRY``, the action status is reset to ``READY``, and the current worker thread will release its lock on the action so that other threads can pick it up when resources permit. ------------------ Creating An Action ------------------ Currently, Senlin actions are mostly generated from within the Senlin engine, either due to a RPC request, or due to aother action's execution. In future, Senlin plan to support user-defined actions (UDAs). Senlin API will provide API for creating an UDA and invoking an action which can be an UDA. --------------- Listing Actions --------------- Senlin provides an ``action_list`` API for users to query the action objects in the Senlin database. Such a query request can be accompanied with the following query parameters in the query string: - ``filters``: a map that will be used for filtering out records that fail to match the criteria. The recognizable keys in the map include: * ``name``: the name of the actions where the value can be a string or a list of strings; * ``target``: the UUID of the object targeted by the action where the value can be a string or a list of strings; * ``action``: the builtin action for matching where the value can be a string or a list of strings; * ``created_time``: the timestamp the action was created; * ``updated_time``: the timestamp the action as last updated; * ``deleted_time``: the timestamp the action was deleted. - ``limit``: a number that restricts the maximum number of action records to be returned from the query. It is useful for displaying the records in pages where the page size can be specified as the limit. - ``marker``: A string that represents the last seen UUID of actions in previous queries. This query will only return results appearing after the specified UUID. This is useful for displaying records in pages. - ``sort_dir``: A string to enforce sorting of the results. It can accept either ``asc`` or ``desc`` as its value. - ``sort_keys``: A string or a list of strings where each string gives an action property name used for sorting. - ``show_deleted``: A boolean indicating whether deleted actions should be included in the results. The default is False. ----------------- Getting An Action ----------------- Senlin API provides the ``action_show`` API call for software or a user to retrieve a specific action for examining its details. When such a query arrives the Senlin engine, the engine will search the database for the ``action_id`` specified. User can provide the UUID, the name or the short ID of an action as the ``action_id`` for query. The Senlin engine will try each of them in sequence. When more than one action matches the criteria, an error message is returned to user, or else the details of the action object is returned. ------------------- Signaling An Action ------------------- When an action is in ``RUNNING`` status, a user can send signals to it. A signal is actually a word that will be written into the ``control`` field of the ``action`` table in the database. When an action is capable of handling signals, it is supposed to check its ``control`` field in the DB table regularly and abort execution in a graceful way. An action has the freedom to check or ignore these signals. In other words, Senlin cannot guarantee that a signal will have effect on any action. The currently supported signal words are: - ``CANCEL``: this word indicates that the target action should cancel its execution and return when possible; - ``SUSPEND``: this word indicates that the target action should suspend its execution when possible. The action doesn't have to return.

There are two roots for the current exception hierarchy: VimException
and VMwareDriverException, which is not a good design. This patch
refactors the exception hierarchy to fix this problem.

Summary of changes:
* Change parent of VimException to VMwareDriverException
* Change parent of exceptions corresponding to known VIM faults
  to VimException
* Change parent of VimSessionOverLoadException, VimConnectionException,
  VimAttributeException and ImageTransferException to
  VMwareDriverException.

The guidelines followed for this refactoring are:
* The changes in existing driver code should be NIL.

* The changes in other parts of the library should be minimal.

* Any exception raised by invocation of vim APIs should be a VimException
  and any exception raised by pbm APIs should be a PbmException. But this
  will result in lot of changes in the library as well as existing clients.
  Therefore, we  define a single root for these two types of exceptions which
  is labeled as VimException.

* Any exception raised by the library should be a child of
  VMwareDriverException. Therefore, VimException, VimSessionOverLoadException,
  VimConnectionException, VimAttributeException and ImageTransferException
  are children of VMwareDriverException. Ideally, VMwareDriverException
  should be renamed as ServiceException, but it will result in backward
  incompatibility.

Cinder has had an lvm_type option for quite a while

thin provisioning.

This required an additional PPA in Precise, but is

This patch adds the lvm_type option, and we'll use

* The current Tempest auth providers check for a very specific
  timestamp format for the ""expires"" field of token responses.
  If the Identity provider sends a response with a valid timestamp
  that does not exactly match this format, test execution is halted.
  Since the auth provider is client code, any specific functional

When I implemented the new target driver code the
methods used for LVM were copy pasted:
 commit 9651f547147188645942466602c92cce06666483

I screwed this up because the block_device driver
doesn't use LVM at all.

This patch sets it back the way it should be and just
uses the local dev file of the whole disk.

Add a parameter to take advantage of the new(ish) eventlet socket timeout
behaviour.  Allows closing idle client connections after a period of

$ time nc localhost 9292

Setting 'client_socket_timeout = 0' means do not timeout.

There is really no need to seperate off the runner into
a unit that builds a state-machine and then provides a tiny
utility function, both of these can just be in the same class
and code so that it is easier to understand/read.

This adds a setup script for each tox functional target to start a
rabbitmq-server, qpidd or redis daemon dedicated for the functional
testing.

This script is responsible to spawn a preconfigured daemon needed for
the functional tests.

This also changes the gate script to just install the required packages
instead of setup a devstack.

This also fixes the zmq config options loading in tests

A while back we broke the inheritance chain of transport and backend
by moving the target drivers outside of the drivers.

This means you can instantiate and use any target (data transport)
method that your device supports without requiring a separate
driver (again, if your device can support it).  This was
particularly important for the LVM ref driver and the 5 iSCSI
options that go with it.

This patch converts the SolidFire driver to use the same model.  For
the most part it's pretty simple:
* Create an internal class for the target driver
* Instantiate the target driver that you want to use
* wrap the old transport calls that come to the driver to call
  the new target driver objects

This exposed some issues with the abc work that was being done.
There are a number of items that are marked as required but are
really only necessary for LVM based drivers.  So this also
creates a san/3'rd party iSCSI subclass as well that has the
more appropriate abc settings for such devices.

Pluggable IPAM implementation requires separation between requesting
address/subnet and it's actual allocation, which can happen on
third-party IPAM servers. Request factory stands for simplifying
building right request from input.

Added AddressRequestFactory and SubnetRequestFactory.

AddressRequestFactory creates instance of AnyAddressRequest or
SpecificAddressRequest depending on presence of ip address in input.
SubnetRequestFactory creates instance of AnySubnetRequest or
SpecificSubnetRequest depending on input.

get_subnet_request_factory and get_address_request_factory can be
redefined on driver level to use custom request factories.

Currently, a keystone IdP does not provide the domain of the project
when generating SAML assertions. Since it is possible to have two
projects with the same name but in different domains, this patch
adds an additional attribute called ""openstack_project_domain""
in the assertion to identify the domain of the project.

Some clouds out there are still running nova-network but we want to
provide support for neutron specific features and concepts like ports,
networks, subnets, etc.

This change is part of a set that adds neutron support to existing
floating IP-related functions, hiding that behind resource-oriented
methods.
For instance, at high level, end-users can now request that a public IP
is assigned to an instance without worrying about the specific service,
procedures and protocols used to provide that feature.

that gate does not execute tox's docs job but runs build_sphinx

Problem description =================== Currently, running 'nova list --all-tenants' with a policy change: ```""compute:get_all_tenants"": ""role:special_role or is_admin:True""``` will not work as expected, The returned list of servers will not contain all instances of all tenants. Use Cases --------- We should support administrators who wish to enable this functionality in their policy.json. Project Priority ---------------- None Proposed change =============== Add a new API microversion for which the API will respond with the list of all servers of all tenants even for non-admins. Alternatives ------------ Treat the bug fix as a minor patch that will not require a new API microversion. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- The new API is added as a microversion. Request:: GET /v2/tenant-uuid/servers/detail?all_tenants=1 The request and response headers, body and possible codes are unchanged from current behaviour. if the policy.json is setup right, non-admins should be able to list all servers. Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- python-novaclient will have to be updated so that it can request the new microversion when the ``list --all-tenants`` option is used. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Davanum Srinivas <davanum@gmail.com> Work Items ---------- * Add a new microversion and change ```nova/api/openstack/compute/servers.py``` to elevate the context when the policy check succeeds. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= * Unit tests and API samples functional tests in the nova tree will be added. Documentation Impact ==================== The nova/api/openstack/rest_api_version_history.rst document will be updated.

Optional service configuration resides in the # conf.d directory. # # You can customize the options in this file and copy it to # /etc/openstack_deploy/openstack_user_config.yml or create a new # file containing only necessary options for your environment # before deployment. # # OSAD implements PyYAML to parse YAML files and therefore supports structure # and formatting options that augment traditional YAML. For example, aliases # or references. For more information on PyYAML, see the documentation at # # http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation # # Configuration reference # ======================= # # Level: cidr_networks (required) # Contains an arbitrary list of networks for the deployment. For each network, # the inventory generator uses the IP address range to create a pool of IP # addresses for network interfaces inside containers. A deployment requires # at least one network for management. # # Option: <value> (required, string) # Name of network and IP address range in CIDR notation. This IP address # range coincides with the IP address range of the bridge for this network # on the target host. # # Example: # # Define networks for a typical deployment. # # - Management network on 172.29.236.0/22. Control plane for infrastructure # services, OpenStack APIs, and horizon. # - Tunnel network on 172.29.240.0/22. Data plane for project (tenant) VXLAN # networks. # - Storage network on 172.29.244.0/22. Data plane for storage services such # as cinder and swift. # # cidr_networks: # management: 172.29.236.0/22 # tunnel: 172.29.240.0/22 # storage: 172.29.244.0/22 # # Example: # # Define additional service network on 172.29.248.0/22 for deployment in a # Rackspace data center. # # snet: 172.29.248.0/22 # # -------- # # Level: used_ips (optional) # For each network in the 'cidr_networks' level, specify a list of IP addresses # or a range of IP addresses that the inventory generator should exclude from # the pools of IP addresses for network interfaces inside containers. To use a # range, specify the lower and upper IP addresses (inclusive) with a comma # separator. # # Example: # # The management network includes a router (gateway) on 172.29.236.1 and # DNS servers on 172.29.236.11-12. The deployment includes seven target # servers on 172.29.236.101-103, 172.29.236.111, 172.29.236.121, and # 172.29.236.131. However, the inventory generator automatically excludes # these IP addresses. Network policy at this particular example organization # also reserves 231-254 in the last octet at the high end of the range for # network device management. # # used_ips: # - 172.29.236.1 # - 172.29.236.11,172.29.236.12 # - 172.29.239.231,172.29.239.254 # # -------- # # Level: global_overrides (required) # Contains global options that require customization for a deployment. For # example, load balancer virtual IP addresses (VIP). This level also provides # a mechanism to override other options defined in the playbook structure. # # Option: internal_lb_vip_address (required, string) # Load balancer VIP for the following items: # # - Local package repository # - Galera SQL database cluster # - Administrative and internal API endpoints for all OpenStack services # - Glance registry # - Nova compute source of images # - Cinder source of images # - Instance metadata # # Option: external_lb_vip_address (required, string) # Load balancer VIP for the following items: # # - Public API endpoints for all OpenStack services # - Horizon # # Option: management_bridge (required, string) # Name of management network bridge on target hosts. Typically 'br-mgmt'. # # Option: tunnel_bridge (optional, string) # Name of tunnel network bridge on target hosts. Typically 'br-vxlan'. # # Level: provider_networks (required) # List of container and bare metal networks on target hosts. # # Level: network (required) # Defines a container or bare metal network. Create a level for each # network. # # Option: type (required, string) # Type of network. Networks other than those for neutron such as # management and storage typically use 'raw'. Neutron networks use # 'flat', 'vlan', or 'vxlan'. Coincides with ML2 plug-in configuration # options. # # Option: container_bridge (required, string) # Name of unique bridge on target hosts to use for this network. Typical # values include 'br-mgmt', 'br-storage', 'br-vlan', 'br-vxlan', etc. # # Option: container_interface (required, string) # Name of unique interface in containers to use for this network. # Typical values include 'eth1', 'eth2', etc. # # Option: container_type (required, string) # Name of mechanism that connects interfaces in containers to the bridge # on target hosts for this network. Typically 'veth'. # # Option: ip_from_q (optional, string) # Name of network in 'cidr_networks' level to use for IP address pool. Only # valid for 'raw' and 'vxlan' types. # # Option: is_container_address (required, boolean) # If true, the load balancer uses this IP address to access services # in the container. Only valid for networks with 'ip_from_q' option. # # Option: is_ssh_address (required, boolean) # If true, Ansible uses this IP address to access the container via SSH. # Only valid for networks with 'ip_from_q' option. # # Option: group_binds (required, string) # List of one or more Ansible groups that contain this # network. For more information, see the openstack_environment.yml file. # # Option: net_name (optional, string) # Name of network for 'flat' or 'vlan' types. Only valid for these # types. Coincides with ML2 plug-in configuration options. # # Option: range (optional, string) # For 'vxlan' type neutron networks, range of VXLAN network identifiers # (VNI). For 'vlan' type neutron networks, range of VLAN tags. Coincides # with ML2 plug-in configuration options. # # Example: # # Define a typical network architecture: # # - Network of type 'raw' that uses the 'br-mgmt' bridge and 'management' # IP address pool. Maps to the 'eth1' device in containers. Applies to all # containers and bare metal hosts. Both the load balancer and Ansible # use this network to access containers and services. # - Network of type 'raw' that uses the 'br-storage' bridge and 'storage' # IP address pool. Maps to the 'eth2' device in containers. Applies to # nova compute and all storage service containers. Optionally applies to # to the swift proxy service. # - Network of type 'vxlan' that contains neutron VXLAN tenant networks # 1 to 1000 and uses 'br-vxlan' bridge on target hosts. Maps to the # 'eth10' device in containers. Applies to all neutron agent containers # and neutron agents on bare metal hosts. # - Network of type 'vlan' that contains neutron VLAN networks 101 to 200 # and uses the 'br-vlan' bridge on target hosts. Maps to the 'eth11' device # in containers. Applies to all neutron agent containers and neutron agents # on bare metal hosts. # - Network of type 'flat' that contains one neutron flat network and uses # the 'br-vlan' bridge on target hosts. Maps to the 'eth12' device in # containers. Applies to all neutron agent containers and neutron agents # on bare metal hosts. # # Note: A pair of 'vlan' and 'flat' networks can use the same bridge because # one only handles tagged frames and the other only handles untagged frames # (the native VLAN in some parlance).

is passed in that will become a 'actual' service after fork.

This will avoid the issues with the complete/fulfilled
service object opening sockets, or performing other actions

This modification adds support for updating volume encryption types. The
encryption-type-update command requires a single argument, the name or
ID of the volume type whose associated encryption type should be
updated, and up to four optional arguments representing new values for
the encryption type attributes. The update implementation supports three
use cases:

1. The user wants to specify new values for attributes of an
   encryption type.
   - include the attribute and its new value at invocation
2. The user wants to preserve the values for attributes of an
   encryption type.
   - exclude the attribute at invocation
3. The user wants to set the values for attributes of an encryption
   type to provider defaults (only valid for cipher and key-size).
   - include the attribute but provide no value at invocation

The encryption type may only be updated if the associated volume type is
unused.

This modification leverages update support for encryption types provided
by the cinder volume encryption type API extension. See the following

After a utils.spawn_n call we lose the context for logging because it's

context.  Additionally a call to context.get_admin_context() would add
that context to the local store making it appear that the context had

This wraps methods being called with spawn_n so that they add the

I think a change in the gate has triggered a different behavior
and now we can not create a server without a network.

Also, I've added a wait for delete method to wait for the vms to
be deleted so the network delete works properly.

When writing to a host device, possibly one that does not support holes,
it is preferable to use host_device instead of the raw mode. Not doing so

The only files in the docker image directories that differ majorly between
distros are the Dockerfiles (e.g. different package manager mechanisms,
different repo sources, etc).

The supporting files such as the start.sh/check.sh and config files should
largely stay the same between base images.

This change moves these files up into a ""common"" directory, and symlinks them
in the same way that the build script is managed. This means when adding a new
base distro only new Dockerfiles need to be created. Also, if a distro does
happen to require a vastly different start.sh script for example, one can
choose to simply not symlink to the common and instead drop in a custom one.

The bootstrap-aio.sh script generates a password by reading a set number
of characters from urandom then removing those that aren't alphanumeric.
The problem with this is that its possible for 0 characters to remain.

This patch changes the order so that tr (translate) reads urandom
directly and removes non alphanumeric characters then that output is
truncated to the required length. This ensures the generated password is
always the desired length.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Unscoped Service Catalog ========================================== Problem Description =================== Some OpenStack services allow you to talk to them using an Unscoped Keystone Token. There currently is no way to discover that list though. This will be important for the workflow as described in the Nova Instance User workflow: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/186617 Proposed Change =============== * An optional flag to the API that creates an unscoped token will be added to return the unscoped service catalog along with the new token. * The existing api to allow you to fetch just the service catalog should be updated to return the unscoped service catalog when called with an unscoped token. * A new column is added to the db to mark a service as being unscoped token compatible. * The api for registering/modifying a service needs updating to support the flag. * The python-keystoneclient needs to be updated to support all of these things from python. Alternatives ------------ * Rather then add the service flag for unscoped token compatible, the unscoped service catalog can be built out of the service list where the url does not contain a '%'. Security Impact --------------- None known. Notifications Impact -------------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- * python-keystoneclient will need to be updated to support these new flags Performance Impact ------------------ Minimal impact. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- None Developer Impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: <launchpad-id or None> Work Items ---------- Same as broken down in the Proposed Change section. Dependencies ============ None Documentation Impact ==================== The documentation related to the new flags would need to be added.

When using the session object we want to pass through unknown kwargs to
the adapter so that keystoneclient can add new parameters as required.

This requires fixing the old options so that we can restrict what is
passed and showing a warning when there are values that are being
ignored.

OpenStack projects do not produce ""open core"" software, they instead produce open source software. There is a subtle but important difference between the two, but the difference is part of the foundation of OpenStack. In addition, the software is produced with a community and contributor accepted license. Open Source At The Core ======================= When we say ""Open Source At the Core"", what we mean is OpenStack projects should not be producing something which requires an enterprise version or some additional proprietary software. OpenStack is producing pure open source projects through it's software. Functionality should not be limited in any way. We strive to make things scalable and efficient in an open source manner. In a similar manner, projects may choose to enable pluggable functionality which allows third party projects and vendors to integrate. This type of architecture is a workable solution. An open source option, whether that is a built in solution or a third party pluggable component, is required to ensure the ""open core"" principle is satisfied. Acceptable Licensing ==================== OpenStack projects must utilize the Apache License, 2.0_ for the source code they produce. This is the license used by all existing OpenStack software. New projects are required to utilize this license as well. The Apache License, 2.0, provides the following benefits: * OSI approved * GPLv3 compatible * DFSG compatible Dependencies and Optional Modules ================================= When utilizing third party modules or libraries which are not Apache 2.0 licensed, contributors need to understand how the interaction between the modules will work. If there are doubts or concerns, it is recommended to put an item on the TC Meeting agenda to discuss with the TC how to proceed. In general, error on the side of caution here. With regards to dependencies, any third party libraries or modules need to be vetted through the requirements team. This ensures the added requirement of including the third party module goes through review and will not conflict with broad cross-project efforts, such as the Python 3 porting effort. .. _2.0: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0",,50,0

Some are services providing infrastructure APIs. Some are libraries being consumed by those services. Some are supporting cast and tools. Most of those are formally ""released"" at given points. We call those ""deliverables"", and use git tags to define the release points. OpenStack deliverables can be released under various models. They all follow the common 6-month development cycle, but may release more than once during those cycles. The release management team manages the release process for a selection of project teams repositories (indicated by the release:managed tag) and provide tools for other teams and repositories to do self-service releases. Common time-based release model =============================== By default, most OpenStack services opt to follow the common, time-based release model. It is recommended at the earlier stages of development, when it is difficult to commit to multiple upgrade paths and large features or architectural refactors are still common. Projects following that model use a pre-version numbering scheme. If the final release will be called 5.0.0, intermediary milestones will be called 5.0.0b1, 5.0.0rc2 etc. The common 6-month time-based release cycle includes 3 development milestones, called $series-1, $series-2 and $series-3. Those make useful reference points in time to organize the development cycle. Project teams may, for example, set specific deadlines that match those dates. b1, b2 and b3 tags are pushed to the repositories to clearly mark those reference points in the git history. The dates for the milestones and final release in a given development cycle are defined by the Release Management team, and communicated before the new development cycle starts. The $series-3 milestone coincides with Feature Freeze (""FF""). Managed projects are requested to stop merging code adding new features, new dependencies, new configuration options, database schema changes, changes in strings... all things that make the work of packagers, documenters or testers more difficult. Feature Freeze Exceptions (""FFE"") may be requested by PTLs to the Release managers. As we get closer to the release date, those are less likely to get accepted. After the $series-3 milestone, a list of release-critical bugs is built, and when all those are fixed (or considered not-release-critical after all), a first release candidate is tagged (rc1). This RC1 will be used as-is as the final release, unless new release-critical issues are found that warrant a RC respin. After RC1 is tagged, a stable/$series branch is cut from that same commit. That is where further release candidates (and the final release) will be tagged. The master branch starts on the new development cycle and is no longer feature-frozen. Potential new release critical issues have first to get fixed on the master branch. Once merged in master, based on their severity and the risk of regression in the patch, they may or may not trigger the opening of a new release candidate window. Once a new RC window is opened, a number of bugs are marked for backport to the stable branch, and the new RC tag is pushed when all the backports are completed. Until the final release is produced, the stable/$series branch is under the control of the release management team, to make sure that merges happen only when a release candidate window is open. On final release day, each project's last release candidate is tagged with the final release version. There is no difference between the last release candidate and the final version, apart from the version number. The stable branch passes under stable maintenance team management, and is open for backports following the stable branch rules. Independent release model ========================= Projects which want to do a formal release more often may opt for an independent model. This is especially suitable to more stable projects which add a limited set of new features and don't plan to go through large architectural changes. Getting the latest and greatest out as often as possible, while ensuring stability and upgradeability. Projects following this model do not use intermediary development milestones. They may tag new versions at any point in time during the development cycle. They do not use Feature Freeze, they do not go through a RC cycle. Those projects must tag a final version for a development cycle (generally in the last month of the cycle). A stable branch is cut from that proposed version, and the master branch will from then on produce releases of the new development cycle. If a critical issue is found in the ""final release"", backports can be pushed to the stable branch and a new ""final release"" be tagged there. That is why it is important to switch the Y component of the X.Y.Z version when we switch to the next development cycle, so that the Z component can be used in future tags on the stable branch. While the release management team will not enforce a formal feature-frozen period for projects in an independent release model, it is recommended to focus on bugfixes and hold on major disruptive features as you get closer to the end of a development cycle, to ensure that the final release of any given development cycle is as usable and bug-free as it can be.

Since snapshot is immutable, we shouldn't provide the capability
to update image metadata referenced with snapshot.
And part of this Spec is not well formatted, we should update it
to make it easier to read after the rst file is coverted into html
file, overall changes is listed below.

- Remove snapshot relevant changes in the SPEC.
- Fix the incorrect format which will cause the html version
  hard to read.
- Update the work items to reflect the latest changes.

Problem description =================== There are cases when the process of deleting or deploying environment may hang. Then the user has to release all used resources and manually clean the database in order to get rid of the list of failed environments. Manual cleaning of the database is unsafe and inconvenient operation. That's why `abandon` feature has to be provided. It should improve usability and allows to user to avoid direct database editing. But it is necessary to notify the user that all resources used by abandoned environment must be also released manually as previously. Proposee change =============== The implementation of this feature consists of three stages: 1) Add REST endpoint for environment-abandon New method *abandon* should be added to murano-api. It will work similar to method *delete* but without object model cleanup before direct removing environment from the database. For this action the new policy rule should be added. Any user will be able to abandon environment created by him. 2) Provide corresponding method in the python-muranoclient Method *abandon* should be added to environment manager. CLI command must also be provided. 3) Add new button *Abandon* to murano-dashboard This button should be available with any environment state Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- **DELETE /environments/<environment_id>/abandon** *Request* +----------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Method | URI | Description | +==========+========================================+=======================================+ | DELETE | /environments/<environment_id>/abandon | Abandon environment with specified id | +----------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ *Parameters:* * `environment_id` - environmet ID, required *Response* +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+ | Code | Description | +================+===========================================================+ | 200 | OK.

If neutron does not work, then it's going to throw inside of list_ports,
which is going to send an OpenStackCloudException through search_ports,
which is then not going to be caught by the NeutronClientException trap

This patch is refactoring the node's and driver's vendor passthru in the
API to a common place (utils.py). Historically this code was duplicated
because each endpoint supported different things (driver's vendor
passhtru endpoing being always synchrounous and node's being always

the code is almost the same it makes sense to have it in a common place,
so changing once will affect both.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ======================= Event statistics ======================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/event-statistics Problem description =================== Not so far along some customers asked a questions about redundant samples and how collect usage time statistics for any resource for period. For example count and active time for instances. We recommended using events for this. At the same time events storages implement only simple request as adding or getting events and traits. If we want to get some analyzed data we should write custom tool script for reading data via api and analyzing it. It's better if ceilometer have native statitics for events. Proposed change =============== Like as meter statistics this feature will be implemented at storage layer. It'll include a standart set of methods and realized in ceilometer aggregation functions stddev and cardinality. Statistics will be queryiable by event_type, timestamp and trait fields. Also they'll have groupby function by trait. For mongodb backend statistics will be implemented via native map-reduce tools. For sqalchemy we'll use method that relative to _make_stats_query. HBase meter statistics implemented as naive reading and calculating data currently. So event statisitics will be same. Elastic search statitics will be implemented via native tools. Api will be relative to meter statistics api. Alternatives ------------ Make a tools for collecting event data via api and analyze their outside ceilometer Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- Add a new api method ""event_statistics"" Security impact --------------- None. Pipeline impact --------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- You may make request for collecting events statistics. Performance/Scalability Impacts ------------------------------- None.

Commit 1668fef9cabea6a23023aab6b97617b4368b14d6 corrected many
wrongs that we have with the oslo.vmware exceptions. The problem
is that that patch broke nova. This patch addresses the code in
Nova to enable it to upgrade to a oslo.vmware package that has
better exception handling.

The patch does the following:
1. Ensures that place that treated VMwareDriverException will also
   treat VimFaultException. This will ensure that the code is backward
   and forward compatible
2. Fixes unit tests to ensure the above

Note: I have tested the code with oslo.vmware 0.13.0

If you have 'pbr' in your LIBS_FROM_GIT list, then the following error
occurs:

+ cd /opt/stack/requirements
/home/ubuntu/devstack/inc/python: line 229: cd: /opt/stack/requirements:
No such file or directory

This is due to commit: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/192494 moving
the clone of 'requirements' after 'setup_lib ""pbr""' - which depends
on the directory existing.

The fix is to move the clone back before the pbr section,
leaving the pip_install for afterwards.

See the `Rebase partitioned alarm evaluation on tooz`_ blueprint for details; * option to split off the alarms persistence into a separate database. See the `Dedicated database for the alarm part of ceilometer`_ blueprint for details; * metering of Neutron networking services: LBaaS, FWaaS & VPNaaS. You can enable it manually in Ceilometer if you are going to deploy additional Fuel plugins: - LBAAS: https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-plugin-neutron-lbaas - FWAAS: https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-plugin-neutron-fwaas - VPNAAS: https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-plugin-neutron-vpnaas * support for persisting events via the MongoDB storage driver (previously limited to SQLAlchemy). See the `Enable event feature on MongoDB and DB2`_ blueprint for details; * support for per-device metering of instance disks. See `Add support to gather per-device metrics for instances`_ blueprint for details; * Ceilometer now uses oslo.messaging instead of openstack.common.rpc. See the `Switch to oslo.messaging`_ blueprint for details; * option to use notifications instead of RPC for metering messages. See the `Replace RPC cast() with notifications`_ blueprint for details; * external MongoDB support. See the `Implement possibility to set external MongoDB connection`_ blueprint for details; * Ceilometer and VCenter integration.

The basic process of alarm evaluation is: 1. Call ceilometerclient to get all enabled alarms as assigned alarms. 2. For every assigned threshold alarm, call ceilometerclient to get statistics list, use the statistics list and threshold and comparison operator to calculate the alarm state. 3. For every assigned combination alarm, call ceilometerclient to get states of alarms needed by this alarm and calculate the alarm state with combination operator. 4. For every assigned alarm, refresh the alarm state, and record the alarm changes, this step may also need call ceilometerclient twice per alarm. Every time of evaluation, the evaluator may read/write data many times from storage backend (database). The current process of interaction of evaluator with storage is: alarm-evaluator->ceilometerclient->ceilometer API->storage If we use default option of evaluation_interval (60s) as the period of evaluation,evaluator will the do above process many times every minute. and if we have a number of alarms in our environment, the amount will be more. The most direct issues of the evaluation cycle are: * Unnecessary interaction of evaluator with identity component (keystone). * Unnecessary interaction of evaluator with ceilometerclient which cause many unnecessary http requests. * Unnecessary parameter validation in ceilometer API because the The legitimacy of the parameters should be ensured by codes of evaluator. Proposed change =============== 1. Refactor the codes of alarm-evaluation service base(Singleton and Partitioned evaluator service) to replace ceilometerclient to storage connection and refactor the relevant unit tests. 2. Refactor the codes of threshold evaluator to replace ceilometerclient to storage connection and refactor the relevant unit tests. 3. Refactor the codes combination evaluator to replace ceilometerclient to storage connection and refactor the relevant unit tests.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ===================================== Use the new enginefacade from oslo_db ===================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/new-oslodb-enginefacade Implement the new oslo.db enginefacade interface described here: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/oslo.db/+spec/make-enginefacade-a-facade Problem description =================== The linked oslo.db spec contains the details of the proposal, including its general advantages to all projects. In summary, we transparently track database transactions using the RequestContext object. This means that if there is already a transaction in progress we will use it by default, only creating a separate transaction if explicitly requested. Use Cases ---------- These changes will only affect developers. * Reduce the opportunities for database deadlocks By reducing the number of database transactions, particularly database transactions in the same thread, we dramatically reduce the opportunity for deadlocks. * Allow a class of database races to be fixed Nova currently only exposes database transactions in nova/db/sqlalchemy/api.py, which means that every db api call is in its own transaction. Although this will remain the same initially, the new interface allows a caller to extend a transaction across several db api calls if they wish. This will enable callers who need these to be atomic to achieve this, which includes the save operation on several Nova objects. * Reduce connection load on the database Many database api calls currently create several separate database connections, which increases load on the database. By reducing these to a single connection, load on the db will be decreased. * Improve atomicity of API calls By ensuring that database api calls use a single transaction, we fix a class of bug where failure results in a partial result. * Make greater use of slave databases for read-only transactions The new api marks sections of code as either readers or writers, and enforces this separation. This allows us to automatically use a slave database connection for all read-only transactions. It is currently only used when explicitly requested in code. Proposed change =============== Code changes ------------ * Decorate the RequestContext class nova.RequestContext is annotated with the @enginefacade.transaction_context_provider decorator. This adds several code hooks which provide access to the transaction context via the RequestContext object. * Update database apis incrementally Database apis will be updated in batches, by function. For example, Service apis, quota apis, instance apis. Invidual calls will be annotated as either readers or writers. Existing transaction management will be replaced. Calls into apis which have not been upgraded yet will continue to explicitly pass the session or connection object. * Remove uses of use_slave wherever possible The use_slave parameter will be removed from all upgraded database apis, which will involve updating call sites and tests. Where the caller no longer uses the use_slave parameter anywhere, the removal will be propagated as far as possible. The exception will be external interfaces. All uses of use_slave will be removed. External interfaces will continue to accept it, but will not use it. Alternatives ------------ Alternatives were examined during the design of the oslo.db code. The goal of this change is to implement a solution which is common across OpenStack projects. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. This change obsoletes the use_slave parameter everywhere it is used, which includes several apis with external interfaces. We remove it from all internal interfaces. For external interfaces we leave it in place, but ignore it. Slave connections will be used everywhere automatically, whenever possible Security impact --------------- Nothing obvious. Notifications impact -------------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance Impact ------------------ By reducing load on the database, the change is expected to be an overall performance improvement. By expanding the scope of transactions, the change has the potential to increase the amount of time that database write locks are held, which may decrease concurrency. However, many of these cases will have previously been race conditions. Database transactions are expected to be short-lived, for example they should not span an external rpc call or a call into hypervisor driver, so the impact of this should be limited. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- Discuss things that will affect other developers working on OpenStack, such as: * If the blueprint proposes a change to the driver API, discussion of how other hypervisors would implement the feature is required. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: mbooth-9 Work Items ---------- * Enable use of the new api in Nova * Migrate api bundles along functional lines: * Service * ComputeNode * Certificate * FloatingIP * DNSDomain * FixedIP * VIF * Instance, InstanceInfoCache, InstanceExtra, InstanceMetadata, InstanceSystemMetadata, InstanceFault, InstanceGroup, InstanceTag * KeyPair * Network * Quota * EC2 * BDM * SecurityGroup * ProviderFWRule * Migration * ConsolePool * Flavor * Cells * Agent * Bandwidth * Volume * S3 * Aggregate * Action * Task * PCIDevice Dependencies ============ A version of oslo.db including the new enginefacade api: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/138215/ Testing ======= This change is intended to have no immediate functional impact. The current tests should continue to pass, except where: * An internal API is modified to remove use_slave * The change exposes a bug * The tests assumed implementation details which have changed Documentation Impact ==================== None.

Previously, 'LOCAL' network type was used to determine whether a
Neutron network is an uplink network or not. This caused a problem in
Neutron because, following the behavior of ML2, all external networks
when 'providernet' extension is enabled usually have a type, and
typically configured to have 'LOCAL' as the default, unless explicitly

We need to be able to download packages from
various repositories taking into account repository
priority. We need this for patching story.

This patch introduces MULTI_MIRROR_CENTOS variable
which is supposed to have the following format:

  ""name1,url1,pri1 name2,url2,pri2""

In case when pri is not defined it will be set to 10,
for example
  ""name1,url1""
        is equal to:
  ""name1,url1,10""

Besides, this patch introduces uniformity for all those
cases USE_MIRROR=msk|srt|none removing unused variables.

It is supposed that USE_MIRROR=none is only used for
building Centos mirror not for building ISO.

This patch implements a user_group_var called 'service_region'

In general, we believe something not tested is broken. OpenStack is an extremely complex suite of software largely designed to interact with other software that can be operated in a variety of configurations. Manual localized testing is unlikely to be sufficient in this situation. Types of Tests ============== OpenStack projects employ a number of approaches to testing: **Unit tests** These tests are generally designed to validate a single method or class and verify that the code operates as designed across all inputs. They may employ mocks or fakes to simplify interaction with components outside the immediate area of the test. Most projects have a large number of unit tests and expect to have near-complete code coverage with those tests. Changes to project code should generally include changes to add testing as well. **Functional tests** Functional tests validate a project in operation (e.g., if the project is an API server, the server will actually be running), though interactions with external components are kept to a minimum. This may be accomplished by using fake drivers for interactions with other components, or simpler implementations of those components. Functional tests are expected to catch most actual operational bugs in an environment that is easier to understand and debug than a full integration test environment. **Integration tests** Integration testing includes the project and all related components operating in as realistic manner as possible. The goal is to identify bugs that are only likely to appear in production, before they are found in production. Often, when a bug is found in integration testing, it may indicate a gap in functional testing. **Style checks** When large numbers of developers work together on a project's codebase, it is often useful to have a set style for code. Style checks (such as pep8 for Python) are an automated way to ensure a consistent code style from all contributors. Automated Test Systems ====================== OpenStack projects can generally be tested locally by developers before submitting changes. However, not all developers have access to sufficient test resources to run all tests, and moreover, project reviewers can not assume that a developer has performed all of the relevant testing. Therefore, OpenStack projects can define a set of test jobs that automatically run on every change to the project. These are run by a tool called *Zuul* and results appear in the Gerrit code review system under the name *Jenkins*. In order to facilitate projects interacting with the automated test system in a standardized way, the Technical Committee has adopted the `Consistent Testing Interface <http://governance.openstack.org/reference/project-testing-interface.html>`_ which describes what facilities a project must provide for both developers and the automated systems to run tests on the project. Project Gating ============== .. TODO: link to core reviewer guidelines OpenStack projects do not permit anyone to directly merge code to a source code repository. Instead, any member of a core reviewer team may approve a change for inclusion, but the actual process of merging is completely automated. After approval, a change is automatically run through tests again, and only if the change passes all of the tests, is it merged. This process ensures that the main branch of development is always working (at least as well as can be determined by its testing infrastructure). This means that a developer can, at any point, check out a copy of the repository and begin work on it without worrying about whether it actually functions. This is also an important part of the egalitarian structure of our community. With no member of the project able to override the results of the automated test system, no one is tempted to merge a change on their own authority under the perhaps mistaken impression that they know better than the test system whether a change functions correctly. For more information on the automated testing infrastructure itself, including how to configure and use it, see the `Infrastructure User Manual <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/>`_.",,92,0

If services are running behind an SSL terminating LB you will want to
differentiate between protocol on internalURL and publicURL endpoints.
This patch allows you to set the values of protocol per endpoint type,
but doesn't change the default behaviour which is to have it set in one
var.

Cinder service emits the formatted inforamation as notifications periodcially. It's better for ceilometer service to add a notification plugin to listen to the topic. If the information payload can be consumed and transformed into samples, it will be helpful for admin users to have an estimation of the future capacity planning. Proposed change =============== Add new metrics for different capacity information carried by capacity payload from notifications emitted by Cinder. They will include: CapacityTotalSize CapacityFreeSize CapacityAllocatedSize CapacityProvisionedSize CapacityVirtualfreeSize Each metric extracts the capacity information which it is intrested in from the notification payload. The admin users can utilize ceilometer statistics API to get the sum of each kind of capacity. Also they can utilize the horizon resource usage page to get the chart of the trend of each kind of capacity information. Alternatives ------------ None. Data model impact ----------------- None. REST API impact --------------- None. Security impact --------------- None. Pipeline impact --------------- None. Other end user impact --------------------- None. Performance/Scalability Impacts ------------------------------- No new impacts. Pre-existing concerns with capacity at the notification and storage handling layers remain. Other deployer impact --------------------- None. Developer impact ---------------- None. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: XinXiaohui Ongoing maintainer: XinXiaohui Work Items ---------- * Add capacity.total.size metric * Add capacity.free.size metric * Add capacity.allocated.size metric * Add capacity.provisioned.size metric * Add capacity.virtual_free.size metric * Test coverage for the above metrics and samples validation. Future lifecycle ================ In the future new types of capacity notifications maybe expected from the Cinder service to account for the statistics data. These will need to be handled later. Dependencies ============ None. Testing ======= Unit and integration Tests will be added to cover the necessary metrics and validate samples generated. Documentation Impact ==================== The added metrics will need to be documented in the `measurements section`_. .. _measurements section: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ceilometer/measurements.html References ========== https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/kilo-cinder-capacity-headroom https://review.openstack.org/#/c/170380 ",,147,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================================================================ Add Libvirt Network as new virtual interface type for libvirt virtualization ============================================================================ https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-network-vif Add libvirt network as new virtual interface (vif) type to Nova's libvirt driver. This allows libvirt instances to connect to a libvirt managed network. The lifecycle of this libvirt network would be controlled by a Neutron ML2 driver and agent. Problem description =================== A vif type for a libvirt network does not yet exist. This vif type will be exploited by a new neutron agent for macvtap guest attachments. Directly using the vif type 'direct' for a macvtap attachment causes trouble during Live Migration. Some additional nova code would be required to figure out the network interface name on the target host. This would be necessary, as the interface name is hardcoded into the domain.xml and could differ from host to host. Libvirt network attachments would offer an abstraction to connect the guest to a generic network name which would be equal on each host. Due to the Neutron core-vendor decomposition a spec and some first code will be hosted on stackforge in the project `networking-macvtap`_ soon. Use Cases ---------- * Attaching libvirt/KVM guests to a libvirt network. The network has been set up by some Neutron code before. No additional impact on actors from the Nova side (configuration is done in Neutron). Project Priority ----------------- None Proposed change =============== Introducing a new vif_type 'libvirt_net' to Nova's libvirt driver. This new type represents the following domain.xml notation: :: <interface type='network'> <source network='<libvirt_net_name>'’/> <model type='virtio' /> </interface> On port binding, the Neutron code enriches the vif_details with the *libvirt_net_name* attribute. :: libvirt_net_name=<The name of the libvirt network generated by neutron> Bandwith configurations are supported like with other vif types. The vnic_type will not be considered on the Nova side. No checkings planned. But the idea is to have the Neutron code just support 'normal'. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None for Nova Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: scheuran (andreas.scheuring@de.ibm.com) Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- None Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= * Unittest * No tempest test, as it would require the corresponding Neutron code Documentation Impact ==================== None for Nova References ========== .. _networking-macvtap: https://launchpad.net/networking-macvtap History ======= .. list-table:: Revisions :header-rows: 1 * - Release Name - Description * - Liberty - Introduced ",,173,0

Hyper-V does not allow stateful ACLs with ""ANY"" protocol, meaning that
security group rules which allows ""ANY"" protocol must be split up
into separate rules for each protocol.
Also, Hyper-V does not allow stateful ICMP rules, which means ICMP rules
must be added both inbound and outbound.

Commit 4306d9190f49e7fadf88669d18effedabc880d3b deprecated the
allow_duplicate_networks config option in Kilo and marked it for removal
in Liberty where the default behavior is to just allow duplicate
networks.

This simply removes the option and checks/tests around it being False.

DocImpact: Removed neutron.allow_duplicate_networks config option. The
           behavior in Liberty is now to simply allow duplicate
           networks.

This reverts commit 5cad113739fa906c3901e530fcbfdee3b48961c1.

The deprecation message says to use datetime.datetime.isoformat()
instead, but the format of the string generated by isoformat isn't
the same as the format of the string generated by isotime. The string
is used in tokens generated by keystone and other public APIs so the
format generated by isotime must continue to be used otherwise we'd
be violating the OpenStack API stability guideline. The function is
used in both keystone and keystoneclient, so if this isn't in a
common place like oslo.utils then we need to copy-paste the code
into multiple projects.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =================================== Adopt Oslo Guru Meditation Reports =================================== `bp guru-meditation-report <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/guru-meditation-report>`_ This spec adopts Oslo Guru Meditation Reports in Keystone. The feature will enhance debugging capabilities of all Keystone services, by providing an easy and convenient way to collect debug data about current threads and configuration, among other things, to developers, operators, and tech support in production deployments. Problem Description =================== Currently,Keystone doesn't provide a way to collect state data from active service processes. The only information that is available to deployers, developers, and tech support is what was actually logged by the service. Additional data could be usefully used to debug and solve problems that occur during Keystone operation. We could be interested in stack traces of green and real threads, pid/ppid info, package version, configuration as seen by the service, etc. Oslo Guru Meditation Reports provide an easy way to add support for collecting the live state info from any service. Report generation is triggered by sending a special(USR1) signal to a service. Reports are generated on stderr, and can be piped into system log based on need. Nova has supported Oslo Guru Meditation Reports. Proposed Change =============== First, the oslo-incubator module (reports.*) should be synchronized into keystone tree. Then, each service process needs to initialize the error report system prior to the service start(). Alternatives ------------ None Security Impact --------------- In theory, the change could expose service internals to someone who is able to send the needed signal to a service. That said, we can probably assume that the user is already authorized to achieve a lot more than just having an access to stack traces and configuration used. Also, if deployers are afraid of the information leak for some reason, they could also make sure their stderr output is channeled into safe place. Because this report is triggered by user, there is no need to add config option to turn on/off this feature. Notifications Impact -------------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ The feature does not require any additional resources until it's triggered by the user. Default report generation is not expected to take too long. Report extensions will need to be assessed on case by case basis. In any case, reports are not expected to be generated too often and are assumed to be debugging capability, not something to trigger once per minute just in case. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- Deployers may be interested in making sure those reports are collected 98 somewhere (e.g. stderr should be captured by syslog). Developer Impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: liusheng<liusheng@huawei.com> Work Items ---------- * sync reports.* module from oslo-incubator * adopt it in all keystone services under keystone/cmd/ * add some developer docs on how to use this feature Dependencies ============ reports.* module is currently going thru graduation consideration. In case it's graduated into oslo.reports library before Keystone switches to it, we won't actually need to sync any code from oslo-incubator but instead add a new external oslo dependency. If Keystone switches to the module before graduation is complete, then we'll need to adopt oslo.reports later as part of usual oslo liaison effort. Documentation Impact ==================== description about this feature should be added to user documentation and developer documentation.

System-faking unit tests have been switched for functional
testing that also performs a negative test.

This can be reused in the openvswitch-agent code to validate

This patch implements these parts of the blueprint:

1) Adds support for domains to service_identity.
Users of this resource may specify a different domain for both the user
and the tenant/project, or may specify the default domain which will apply
to both user and tenant.  This also adds the same domain support to
keystone::endpoint since that class uses service_identity.

2) Adds a make_keystone_role_name helper method which will construct a
valid domain aware role name.  This is intended to be used in the other
puppet modules (puppet-glance) that set notifications based on
keystone_user_role resources, in order to construct valid domain aware
names for these resources.

3) Adds a new resource keystone::resource::authconfig - this manages
keystone authentication for other puppet modules by managing the
[keystone_authtoken] section in the config.  Encapsulating the
authentication configuration in this resource will ensure that we
will be able to support the several new types of authentication coming
in current and future Keystone releases.  This supports all of the
authentication options specified at:
http://www.jamielennox.net/blog/2015/02/17/loading-authentication-plugins/

4) Cleans up domain support in admin.pp and uses the new helper method

According to Sam's change[1], for now, we should change
get_more_nodes's 3rd tier to use just ip instead of ip_ports
to make cluster's failure domain to be mapped to actual hardware.
See [1] in detail.

Tiers definition here is as:
1st: Region, 2nd: Zone, 3rd: Ip (previously Ip_ports), 4th: Device

In addition, if we keep current behavior and assign different
ports to each disk in the node, get_more_nodes would do device

That's unfortunately wasted and not to ensure ip-level failure domain.

A replication ID is sent with all requests to associate the calls for a single partition replication operation. This helps eliminate a common problem where we serve an expensive REPLICATE call, only to reject the subsequent rsync due to concurrency limits. The server can inexpensively reject the initial REPLICATE call if it's already at the incoming replication concurrency limit. The SYNC method replaces rsync for transmitting data. It functions like a simple PUT operation to the real destination file path relative to the root, and can accept .data, .meta, or .ts files. It looks something like: SYNC /sda/objects/123/fff/ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff/12345.6789.data HTTP/1.1 X-Attrs: [hex-encoded xattr data] X-Replication-Id: [unique ID per partition replication] Content-Length: [size] Expect: 100-Continue SYNC request responses: 201: file was successfully uploaded 400: there was a problem with the request 409: this file or a newer one already exists 500: mostly caused by filesystem errors 507: disk unmounted or full The X-Attrs header contains the hex-encoded raw pickled metadata from the file's xattrs. If the replicator receives a 409 response with the ""Newer-File-Exists: true"" header, the file is stale and can be removed. It's hoped that this will reduce the incidence of orphaned object data that can occur with long-lived handoffs. Since the SYNC method invalidates hashes, the followup REPLICATE call to force the server to recalculate suffixes is no longer required. However, an ""end"" request is sent to inform the server that the replication pass has finished, and it can remove that replication ID from its concurrency accounting.",,41,0

Updated the validation schema for ACLs.
  - Removed write, list, and delete operations since they are not yet supported.
  - Added line for no additional properties other than ""users"" and ""creator_only""
  - Added unit tests covering all of these and other conditions.
  - Updated unit tests to limit to ""read"" ACLs
  - Removed unit tests covering cases with more than one operation

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================== HMAC Signature Based Token ========================== `bp hmac-signature-based-token <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/hmac-signature-based-token>`_ Hash-based message authentication code is prevalent in Cryptography to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authentication of a message. See `Hash-based message authentication code <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code>`_ This specification proposes use of HMAC signature technique for generation and validation of user authentication token. Verification of data integrity and authentication of a message will validate the user authentication and claims. This technique is already used in OpenStack Object Storage to generate and validate temporary access URL for objects. See `Temporary URL <http://docs.openstack.org/juno/config-reference/content/ object-storage-tempurl.html>`_ for more information on Temporary URL. Problem Description =================== There are following two types of tokens are supported by Keystone currently. ``UUID Tokens``: These tokens are clear text JSON documents provided to users after successful authentication. Token contains service endpoints and roles to operate on the service. User access resources by presenting the `tokens_id` to service. Users claims their authenticity and rights to access the resources owned by their project. Service (middle-ware) validates the claim by validating the token from Keystone. ``PKI Tokens``: These are PKI encrypted form of the UUID tokens provided to the users after successful authentication. Users have to presents the entire cypher text to the service to access the resources. Claim validation will be done by decrypting the cypher text and validating the signature. In a cloud deployment, all services (Keystone, Compute, Cinder…) share the same PKI keys to make the validation successes. Below are the problems with the above two token style: * Token documents are relatively big data stored in database, which imposes maintainability overhead to the cloud operations. * In large-scale cloud deployments token document size may grow significantly big, which can lead to database grow out of hand. * As part of `UUID` token validation process, Keystone has to provide entire token data to the service over the network. This causes extra network overhead; in large-scale high traffic cloud deployments this can not be scalable approach. * PKI tokens are large encrypted data, which users are supposed to send to service over request header. Growing number of regions and availability zones in a cloud setup can easily increase the size of token data to allowed limit. * Services have to share same PKI artifacts (private key) that can cause as big security gap. Proposed Change =============== There is a need of an intermediate solution which reduces the persistence aspect and also reduce transmitting large data over network. A new token provider will be added to the Keystone service, which will responsible for generation of HMAC based tokens. The new token provider will be preserving the current token structure with added HMAC signature constructs in the service catalog section, per endpoint. New cryptographic key (a.k.a. HMAC-Key) will be generated for each token request; this key will be used to generate the HMAC signature in the token for each endpoints. Message to generate the signature will be constructed using service_id, region_id, endpoint URL, project_id, user roles on project and token expiration time. This way HMAC signature will be bind to an expiration time. User will be required to provide the HMAC signature and expiration time on query parameter (or in separate header) along with the `token_id` in `X-Auth-Header`. They are also required to provide necessary information (e.g. service_id, region_id, endpoint URL, project_id, user roles on project) so that the middleware can rebuild the message to generate the signature. Middleware will query Keystone to collect the `HMAC-Key` associated with the token_id. In response Keystone will provide the `HMAC-Key` along with expiration time as long as the key is not expired. Middleware will generate the message using the information provided by user, it will also include the expiration time provided by user from query string. Message digest will generated for the message, using HMAC-Key and same hash algorithm (e.g. Sha-256, Sha-512) which was used by Keystone to generate the signature. Validation will be done by matching the message digest with the signature provided by user. Signature validation will fail if user is trying to fool the system by any means. Following are some approaches to manage and maintenance of these keys: 1. Generate HMAC-Keys per token request and store in database. We will not be storing entire token data only `token_id`, `hmac_key` and `expiration_time` will be stored. While validation signature Keystone will handover `hmac_key` and `expiration_time` to the middleware, which will cache this data till its expiration for future use. ``Pros``: Less maintenance, less network footprint. ``Cons``: Caching infrastructure for middleware, token revocation will be trouble. Use notification framework (revocation event) to revoke tokens. 2. Generate HMAC-Keys per token per endpoint and store in database. In this case we will be storing `token_id`, `endpoint_id`, `hmac_key` and `expiration_time`. While validation signature Keystone will handover `hmac_key` and `expiration_time` to the middleware based on endpoint_id. In this model Keystone can delete the key after giving it to the middleware. ``Pros``: True Ephemeral for Keystone, Less maintenance, less network footprint. ``Cons``: Caching infrastructure for middleware, token revocation will be trouble as there is no handle left with Keystone to track the key. 3. Generate HMAC-Keys per token request and store in database (as per option #1). Maintain an in-memory small cache of Keys in Keystone to avoid database lookup per request. Provide the HMAC-key to middleware for each validation request for the same token. Alternatively, middleware can pass the message and signature, Keystone will validate signature and respond with Yes/On like result. In this model HMAC-key will not leave Keystone. ``Pros``: More secure and token revocation is on control. * Reduces the persistence aspect to minimal. Entire token document vs just `token_id`,`hmac_key` and `expiration_time`. * Very small data set to manage, operation will be easy. * Least change in the token format. * Very light weight as compared to PKI. * No need to share PKI keys. * Reduces over the network data exchanges for validation response. ``Cons``: Keystone has to maintain the keys per token in DB. Note: We need to consider storing `user_id` and `project_id` to support different token revocation use cases. Alternatives ------------ There was a proposal for AE tokens, which is encrypted token. Relatively bigger than the HMAC token. At the same time validation process is also transmitting bigger data between Keystone and service. Data Model Impact ----------------- We have to store token_id, hmac-key and expiration; for that we can use the current data model or we can have totally separate model for this token provider. REST API Impact --------------- Token response will have added fields for HMAC signature and expiration. Note: We can use the expiration field from token for signature expiration and get rid of one extra filed. Following is an example of token response with HMAC signature. .. code-block:: javascript Headers: X-Subject-Token X-Subject-Token: e80b74 { ""token"": { ""methods"": [ ""password"" ], ""roles"": [ { ""id"": ""f8c883654d744166b9d23e937837b146"", ""name"": ""admin"" } ], ""expires_at"": ""2015-01-29T01:59:31.576241Z"", ""project"": { ""domain"": { ""id"": ""4543da6f81e44fc8b013a740ef71f9e8"", ""name"": ""test-domain"" }, ""id"": ""86741b3f86ce4784bd77045a735db5d1"", ""name"": ""test-project"" }, ""catalog"": [ { ""endpoints"": [ { ""region_id"": ""us-east"", ""url"": ""http://mycloud.com:39390/compute"", ""region"": ""us-east"", ""interface"": ""public"", ""id"": ""d2275aeb928445bd8792cd67ee9c5f8d"", ""sig"": ""3d1b53987a4ece5b496abd2245522daee79 a1d0f73e4579e6a0495b22e4338ca"", ""expires_at"": ""1422646386"" } ], ""type"": ""compute"", ""id"": ""cf64bbc58c0446d786da4145a517866b"", ""name"": ""Nova"" } ], ""extras"": {}, ""user"": { ""domain"": { ""id"": ""4543da6f81e44fc8b013a740ef71f9e8"", ""name"": ""test-domain"" }, ""id"": ""3c9891dd12644437bf935b46d2dbd379"", ""name"": ""Arvind Tiwari"" }, ""audit_ids"": [ ""mztfYOmpTGy6O8oVsKlj1w"" ], ""issued_at"": ""2015-01-29T00:59:31.576283Z"" } } Security Impact --------------- None Notifications Impact -------------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- Deployer have to configure new token provider.

In addition, a robust, enterprise-ready CA plugin is provided for the Dogtag CA. Instructions for setting up the CA are provided at :doc:`Dogtag Setup Instructions <./dogtag_setup>`. More details can be found in the :doc:`certificate reference <../reference/certificates>`. .. _order_certificate: How to Order a Certificate ########################## Barbican can be used to request certificate issuance from a number of private and public Certificate Authorities (CAs). This is done through the Orders interface. There are several types of certificate orders available: * Simple CMC * Stored Key * Custom An example of each kind of certificate request is provided below. When the certificate order is received, a certificate order is generated and the client will be provided an order reference. This order will be in PENDING state. Once the certificate order has been fulfilled and the certificate is issued, the order state will be updated to ACTIVE, and the order will be updated to include a reference to a Certificate Container. .. _simple_cmc_order: Simple CMC Certificate Order **************************** The easiest way to obtain a certificate us to provide a simple CMC request to the server using a Simple CMC Order type. In the example below, we will use openssl commands to generate an RSA key pair, and use this key pair to create a CSR. .. code-block:: bash openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048 openssl req -new -key private.pem -out csr.pem -subj '/CN=server1,o=example.com' base64 ./csr.pem |tr -d '\r\n' The output of the last command will be a base64 encoded string that can be pasted into a JSON request for a Simple CMC Certificate order. .. code-block:: bash curl -X POST -H 'content-type:application/json' -H 'X-Project-Id: 12345' \ -d '{""type"": ""certificate"", \ ""meta"": { ""request_data"": ""LS0tLS1CRUdJT..... oK2Fkh6dXBTVC0tLS0tCg=="", \ ""request_type"": ""simple-cmc"", ""ca_id"": ""422e6ad3-24ae-45e3-b165-4e9487cd0ded"", ""profile"": ""caServerCert""}}' \ http://localhost:9311/v1/orders The ca_id and profile parameters are not required. The profile represents a specific kind of certificate product (a three year server cert, for instance) as defined by the CA and CA plugin. For a Dogtag CA, ""caServerCert"" is usually a profile that corresponds to a server cert and which is automatically approved and issued. More details can be found in :doc:`Dogtag Setup Instructions <./dogtag_setup>`. The result of this JSON request will be an order reference, which, when fulfilled will contain a reference to a certificate container. The certificate can be extracted as shown above. .. code-block:: bash {""order_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/orders/df1d1a0f-8454-46ca-9287-c57ced0418e7""} .. _stored_key_order: Stored Key Certificate Order **************************** Stored Key certificate orders take advantage of the fact that Barbican is also a repository for secrets. RSA private keys can be either generated on the client and stored in Barbican beforehand using the secrets interface, or generated in Barbican directly using the orders interface. All that is required for the certificate order is the reference to the secret container for the RSA key pair, and any parameters needed to generate a CSR. Barbican will retrieve the RSA key pair (assuming the user has permission to access it) and will generate the CSR on the user's behalf. The CSR will then be submitted to a back-end CA. This may be particularly useful for provisioning flows. In the example below, we will generate a RSA key pair using the Orders interface, and use this generated secret to create a Stored Key Order. .. code-block:: bash curl -X POST -H 'content-type:application/json' -H 'X-Project-Id: 12345' \ -d '{""type"": ""asymmetric"", \ ""meta"": { ""algorithm"": ""rsa"", \ ""bit_length"": ""2048""}}' \ http://localhost:9311/v1/orders This should provide a response as follows: .. code-block:: bash {""order_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/orders/cb3c43d6-e30c-40c0-b28c-b0dd58a6209d""} We can retrieve the reference to the container containing the RSA key pair from the order. .. code-block:: bash curl -H 'content-type:application/json' -H 'X-Project-Id: 12345' \ http://localhost:9311/v1/orders/cb3c43d6-e30c-40c0-b28c-b0dd58a6209d .. code-block:: bash {""status"": ""ACTIVE"", ""updated"": ""2015-05-09T22:40:05.007512"", ""created"": ""2015-05-09T22:40:01.556689"", ""container_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/containers/1e71dc2b-cf63-4aa4-91f7-41ea1a9e5493"", ""order_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/orders/cb3c43d6-e30c-40c0-b28c-b0dd58a6209d"", ""meta"": {""algorithm"": ""rsa"", ""bit_length"": ""2048""}, ""type"": ""asymmetric""} Now that we have a reference to the container, we can create a stored-key request. .. code-block:: bash curl -X POST -H 'content-type:application/json' -H 'X-Project-Id: 12345' \ -d '{""type"": ""certificate"", \ ""meta"": { ""source_container_ref"": ""http://localhost:9311/v1/containers/1e71dc2b-cf63-4aa4-91f7-41ea1a9e5493"", \ ""subject_dn"": ""cn=server1, o=example.com"", ""request_type"": ""stored-key"", ""ca_id"": ""422e6ad3-24ae-45e3-b165-4e9487cd0ded"", ""profile"": ""caServerCert""}}' \ http://localhost:9311/v1/orders As noted in the previous section, ca_id and profile are optional. The response will be a reference to the created order. .. _custom_certificate_order: Custom Certificate Order ######################## A custom certificate order (which is also the order type assumed when no certificate order type is provided) is an order in which any request attributes are submitted to the back-end CA unchanged. This is useful if you wish to communicate with a specific CA and wish to provide parameters that are specific to that CA.

If a path needs to be changed, for example, the datasource must be deleted and a new one created. The most common use case is a situation where a user creates a datasource, runs a job, and receives an error from the job because the path does not exist. Although it is not strictly necessary, editable datasource objects would be a convenience when a user needs to correct a path or credentials. Problem description =================== There are no API methods for updating a datasource object in the REST API or at the conductor level. The only way to correct a datasource is to delete an existing one and create a new one with corrected information. Although it is possible to use the same name, the object id will be different. If editing is allowed, a user only needs to do a single operation to make corrections. Additionally, the id is preserved so that objects which reference it will reference the corrected path. In the general case, editing a datasource should not be a problem for a job execution which references it. Once a job execution enters the ""RUNNING"" state, any information in datasource objects it references has been extracted and passed to the process running the job. Consequently, editing a dataource referenced by running or completed jobs will cause no errors. On relaunch, a job execution will extract the current information from the datasource. There is only a small window where perhaps editing should not be allowed. This is when a datasource object is referenced by a job execution in the ""PENDING"" state. At this point, information has not yet been extracted from the datasource object, and a change during this window would cause the job to run with paths other than the ones that existed at submission time. Proposed change =============== Add an update operation to the REST API for datasource objects. Do not allow updates for datasource objects that are referenced by job executions in the ""PENDING"" state (this can be checked during validation). Alow any fields in a datasource object to be updated except for id. The object id should be preserved. Add the corresponding update operation to the python-saharaclient.

If a path needs to be changed, for example, the job binary must be deleted and a new one created. The most common use case is a situation where a user creates a job binary, runs a job, and receives an error from the job because the path does not exist. Although it is not strictly necessary, editable job binary objects would be a convenience when a user needs to correct a path or credentials. Problem description =================== There are no API methods for updating a job binary object in the REST API or at the conductor level. The only way to correct a job binary is to delete an existing one and create a new one with corrected information. Although it is possible to use the same name, the object id will be different. If editing is allowed, a user only needs to do a single operation to make corrections. Additionally, the id is preserved so that objects which reference it will reference the corrected path. In the general case, editing a job binary should not be a problem for a job object that references it. Once a job execution enters the ""RUNNING"" state, any job binary objects it references indirectly through the job object have been uploaded to the cluster for execution. Consequently, editing a job binary object will cause no errors. There is only a small window where editing should not be allowed. This is when a job binary object is referenced by a job execution in the ""PENDING"" state. At this point, binaries have not yet been uploaded to the cluster and a change during this window would cause the job to run with paths other than the ones that existed at submission time. Proposed change =============== Add an update operation to the REST API for job binary objects. Do not allow updates for job binaries that are referenced by job executions in the ""PENDING"" state (this can be checked during validation). Allow any fields in a job binary object to be updated except for id. The object id should be preserved. Add the corresponding update operation to the python-saharaclient.

In the ring builder, we place partitions with maximum possible
dispersion across tiers, where a ""tier"" is region, then zone, then
IP/port,then device. Now, instead of IP/port, just use IP. The port
wasn't really getting us anything; two different object servers on two
different ports on one machine aren't separate failure
domains. However, if someone has only a few machines and is using one
object server on its own port per disk, then the ring builder would
end up with every disk in its own IP/port tier, resulting in bad (with
respect to durability) partition placement.

For example: assume 1 region, 1 zone, 4 machines, 48 total disks (12
per machine), and one object server (and hence one port) per
disk. With the old behavior, partition replicas will all go in the one
region, then the one zone, then pick one of 48 IP/port pairs, then
pick the one disk therein. This gives the same result as randomly
picking 3 disks (without replacement) to store data on; it completely
ignores machine boundaries.

With the new behavior, the replica placer will pick the one region,
then the one zone, then one of 4 IPs, then one of 12 disks
therein. This gives the optimal placement with respect to durability.

The same applies to Ring.get_more_nodes().

Design Summit ============= Design Summits are events held at the beginning of a development cycle, every 6 months. They are a key part of the ""Open Design"" promise: they are open to the public, and recent contributors are sponsored by the OpenStack Foundation to attend free of charge. They were modeled after Ubuntu Developers Summits, which are now discontinued. Goals ----- OpenStack Design Summits have several goals: * For features at the early design stages, get feedback on early direction and quick convergence across a broad range of attendees * For features that are being implemented, get it through the final implementation stages and engage with potential contributors and testers * Get alignment on project team priorities for the upcoming development cycle * Meet in person with fellow contributors, socialize in the hallway track or evening events, reset relationships after heated online discussions The OpenStack Design Summits are not for traditional speaker-to-audience presentations. They should all be open discussions about a specific technical topic. Therefore, usage of slides or microphones is discouraged, to reduce the distance between the session proposer/moderator and the rest of the audience. Event structure --------------- The event lasts for 4 days and is organized in tracks. * The first day is usually dedicated to the ""cross-project workshops"" track. This track is meant to provide a forum to discuss and address issues that span more than just one project team. Sessions are generally 40-min long or 90-min long. * The second and third days are usually dedicated to project team tracks (one per project team). Sessions are generally 40-min long. * The ""Ops"" track is spread across those first three days. Originally a separate event (the ""Ops Summit""), the operators feedback and discussions are now an integral part of our design process. Sessions are generally 40-min or 90-min long. * The last day is generally organized as ""contributors meetups"": half a day or a full day of open discussion between project team members. The agenda is generally decided on the spot based on the result of the previous sessions, and the amount of energy left at that stage. Session types ------------- There are two types of rooms available for sessions, which condition the type of session you can hold in them. *Fishbowl* sessions happen in large rooms that can hold between 100 and 300 people. Those rooms are equipped with a projector and whiteboards, and are organized in fishbowl style (concentric circles of chairs, people who want to engage in the discussion should move to the center of the fishbowl) Those sessions are for open discussions where a lot of participation and feedback is desirable. They generally have catchy titles and appear prominently on the Design Summit schedule. *Working* sessions happen in smaller rooms that can hold between 20 and 40 people. Those rooms are equipped with a monitor and whiteboards, and are organized in boardroom style (everyone around a large table). Those sessions are for a smaller group of contributors to get specific work done or prioritized. They generally have a blanket title (like ""infra team working session"") and redirect to an etherpad for more precise and current information about content, in an attempt to limit out-of-team participation and avoid overcrowding the room. Pre-summit organization ----------------------- A few months before the event, every PTL is contacted by the event organizers to get an idea of the session needs for their project team track. After conferring with their teams, they should answer with a number of fishbowl sessions and working sessions desired. The organizing staff at the Foundation will gather all requirements and allocate slots based on project requests and availability in the venue, potentially arbitrating using metrics showing team development activity over the past cycle. With that allocation in mind, each project team should come up with a list of topics to cover in fishbowl and working sessions. This is usually done through collaborative tools like etherpad.openstack.org and multiple team meetings. Approximately a month before summit, the draft slot / room allocation will be proposed. It tries to minimize block conflicts (a project being prevented from attending any session from another project), but comments are welcome before it is made final. A few weeks before summit, PTLs will be asked to push the proposed schedule through tooling that will connect to the scheduling app used at the Summit. During the summit ----------------- We use etherpad.openstack.org to take notes during sessions. It is generally a good idea to prepare those etherpads in advance and list them on the common list of Design Summit etherpads. Each session should have a moderator to keep the discussion on track, and try to get to actionable outcomes before the end of the session. It is generally the person who suggested the session in the first place. As a courtesy to attendees, make sure to start your session on time and end your session on time, so that they can easily jump to another room. Vacate the room at the end of the session, and continue the discussion in the hallway if necessary. Midcycle sprints ================ Midcycle sprints (also named *midcycle meetups*) are optional project team gatherings that happen between Design Summits. They should be announced on the openstack-dev mailing-list and listed on: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Sprints Those are freely organized by project teams, usually using space donated by Foundation member companies. Travel costs are the responsibility of the individual attending (their employer most likely). Those are especially useful in the early days of joining or forming a team, when social bonds and trust need to be established. Multiple sprints may be co-located, especially when there are good cross-pollination opportunities between the involved teams. However, productivity also lies in the small, quiet environment, and social bonding is easier in smaller groups. Note that the Design Summit should be the first choice for gathering the whole team for decisions and roadmap alignment. Attendance to the midcycle sprints should never be mandatory. It is therefore better to have a specific objective for the sprint and use it to get things done. Any feeling of ""required"" attendance (social or actual) may cause hard feelings, especially marginalizing contributors without a corporate sponsor, family caretakers, and people who need Visas to travel. To enable people to focus on the same topic at the same time, without factoring in the monetary and life cost of travel, we also support Virtual Sprints held on IRC. See https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/VirtualSprints for details.",,161,0

Rackspace wanted to rewrite the infrastructure code running its Cloud servers offering, and considered open sourcing the existing Cloud files code. At the same time, Anso Labs (contracting for NASA) had published Nova.cc, a Python-based compute infrastructure-as-a-service proof-of-concept. Both efforts converged and formed the base for OpenStack. The first Design Summit was held in Austin, TX mid-July 2010, and the project was officially announced at OSCON July 21st, 2010. The mission =========== The OpenStack mission is ""to produce the ubiquitous Open Source Cloud Computing platform that will meet the needs of public and private clouds regardless of size, by being simple to implement and massively scalable"". It appeared on the wiki on May 24th, 2010 and still captures the long-term goal of the OpenStack community. The Four Opens ============== The best short definition of ""the OpenStack Way"" is the four opens. The original version of these appeared June 28th, 2010 on the wiki. In the following chapters, we'll further elaborate on those basic principles and explain more precisely what they mean for OpenStack project teams. Open source ----------- We do not produce ""open core"" software. We are committed to creating truly open source software that is usable and scalable. Truly open source software is not feature or performance limited and is not crippled. There will be no ""Enterprise Edition"". We use the Apache License, 2.0. * OSI approved, * GPLv3 compatible * DFSG compatible Open design ----------- We are committed to an open design process. Every six months the development community holds a design summit to gather requirements and write specifications for upcoming release. The design summits, which are open to the public, include users, developers, and upstream projects. We gather requirements and produce an approved roadmap used to guide development for the next six months. The community controls the design process. You can help make this software meet your needs. Open development ---------------- We maintain a publicly available source code repository through the entire development process. We do public code reviews. We have public roadmaps. This makes participation simpler, allows users to follow the development process and participate in QA at an early stage. Open community -------------- One of our core goals is to maintain a healthy, vibrant developer and user community. Most decisions are made using a lazy consensus model. All processes are documented, open and transparent. The technical governance of the project is a community meritocracy with contributors electing technical leads and members of the Technical Committee. All project meetings are held in public IRC channels and recorded. A quick history of OpenStack governance ======================================= Original governance ------------------- The original project governance defined three main bodies: the Advisory Board, the Architecture Board and Technical Committees for each sub-project. This was quickly replaced early 2011 by the Project Oversight Committee, which consisted of a mix of elected and Rackspace-appointed members. PTLs were appointed by Rackspace too. The governance model was once again tweaked in March 2011. The Project Oversight Committee was renamed to Project Policy Board (still a mix of appointed and elected members), and PTLs were elected by the contributors to their project for the first time. The OpenStack Foundation ------------------------ In September 2012, the OpenStack Foundation was launched as an independent body providing shared resources to protect, empower, and promote OpenStack software and the community around it. The reponsibilities of the Project Policy Board were split between two bodies: * The Foundation board of directors, which defines the objectives of the OpenStack Foundation, controls how the Foundation budget is spent, and has authority on the OpenStack trademark * The Technical Committee, which manages the technical matters and has authority over the open source upstream OpenStack Project The Technical Committee was originally formed by all the PTLs + five members directly elected by all the contributors. In June 2013, to accommodate the growth in the number of project teams and PTLs, the Technical Committee decided to switch to 13 directly-elected members instead. Half of those are renewed every 6 months. ",,122,0

This is not intended to be complete, just
a good start that greatly reduces #noqa and

This is widely available and doesn't require any fancy hardware to work with [1]_. The Wake-On-Lan driver is a **testing** driver not meant for production. And useful for users that wants to try Ironic with real baremetal instead of virtual machines but only have some old PCs around. It's important to note that Wake-On-Lan is only capable of powering on the machine. When power off is called the driver won't take any action and will just log a message, the power off require manual intervention to be performed. Also, since Wake-On-Lan does not offer any means to determine the current power state of the machine, the driver relies on the power state set in the Ironic database. Any calls to the API to get the power state of the node will return the value from the Ironic's database. Drivers ======= pxe_wol ^^^^^^^ Overview ~~~~~~~~ The ``pxe_wol`` driver uses the Wake-On-Lan technology to control the power state, PXE/iPXE techonolgy for booting and the iSCSI methodology for deploying the node. Requirements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ None Configuring and Enabling the driver ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 1. Add ``pxe_wol`` to the list of ``enabled_drivers`` in */etc/ironic/ironic.conf*. For example:: [DEFAULT] ... enabled_drivers = pxe_ipmitool,pxe_ucs,agent_ucs 2. Restart the Ironic conductor service:: service ironic-conductor restart Registering a node with the Wake-On-Lan driver ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Nodes configured for Wake-On-Lan driver should have the ``driver`` property set to ``pxe_wol``. The node should have at least one port registered with it because the Wake-On-Lan driver will use the MAC address of the ports to create the magic packet [2]_. The following configuration values are optional and can be added to the node's ``driver_info`` as needed to match the network configuration: - ``wol_host``: The broadcast IP address; defaults to **255.255.255.255**. - ``wol_port``: The destination port; defaults to **9**. .. note:: Say the ``ironic-conductor`` is connected to more than one network and the node you are trying to wake up is in the ``192.0.2.0/24`` range. The ``wol_host`` configuration should be set to **192.0.2.255** then, so the packets will get routed correctly. The following sequence of commands can be used to enroll a node with the Wake-On-Lan driver. 1. Create Node:: ironic node-create -d pxe_wol [-i wol_host=<broadcast ip> [ -i wol_port=<destination port>]] The above command ``ironic node-create`` will return UUID of the node, which is the value of *$NODE* in the following command. 2. Associate port with the node created:: ironic port-create -n $NODE -a <MAC address> References ========== .. [1] Wake-On-Lan - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN ..

To facilitate offline installs, any explicit URLs should be
moved to a location where they can be easily overridden with
a local equivalent.

That way, a default install will use the canonical location, but
a user can easily override this behavior in inventory.

(Such gymnastics are not necessary for apt/yum/pip, because those
