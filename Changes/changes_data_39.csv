Switch to using the Dynamic Aggregates API as the Metric Aggregation
API is deprecated.

When using the Dynamic Aggregates API, any aggregation using rates
can use the underlying base measures for the aggregation rather than
the rate, for example:

    (aggregation rate:mean (metric cpu mean))

The tuple of data for each record returned via this API is encapsulated
with information about the aggregation used so adapt the sanitization
function to deal with this and the formatting of the metrics measures
API as well.

provision_node is called from thread pool workers so the call order is
not deterministic. This causes py38 job failures sometimes.

This change asserts that the expected calls are occuring, but not

In one test, we are downloading the entire image (into memory) and
re-uploading it. That works when the image is 16MiB but not when it
is 1GiB. This adds support to the internal http client for chunked
downloads (similar to upload), makes the image client able to take
that flag, and finally makes the offending test do a chunked upload/

Note this un-skips the test, effectively reverting a6b7e334c

This patch changes client_socket_timeout config value of neutron
to 60(sec) from default 900(sec).

CI fails sometimes due to Heat timeout. The cause of timeout is
that create server API to nova takes too long time (900 sec).
It seems the communication between nova and neutron takes too
long time (900 sec) from log files.

This patch mitigates its value (900) to 60 for avoiding Heat
timeout. Note that the root cause of communication problem
between nova and neutron is not revealed.

There are two problems we need to solve when enabling FIPS for
multinode Ubuntu jobs.

1. Ubuntu nodes require a subscription to be activated with a
   subscription key that is stored as a secret in project-config.

2. Because enabling FIPS requires a reboot, we need to execute the
   enable-fips playbook before the multinode playbook.  If not,
   resources set up by the multinode playbook may not survive the
   reboot.

To solve these problems, we have created a new base job for
OpenStack multinode jobs.  (openstack-multinode-fips).  We expect
to use this job as the base job for OpenStack multinode jobs
instead of the multinode job in zuul-jobs.

The openstack-multinode-fips inherits from openstack-fips, which
is a job defined in project-config that access the UA subscription
key and activates the UA subscription.  This solves problem #1.

It then executes the enable-fips and multinode playbooks
(FIPS first!), which in turn, invoke the enable-fips and multinode
roles in zuul-jobs.  This solves problem #2.

This has the unfortunate result of having to duplicate the logic
of the multinode/pre.yaml playbook in zuul-jobs here in
openstack-zuul-jobs instead, but I can't see a way around that.

Note that unless the variable enable_fips is defined to be true
in the job, all the FIPS logic is essentially a no-op.

If enable_fips is set to True, then jobs will also need to specify
nslookup_target for the post-reboot-tasks role invoked by the
enable_fips role.

The proposed keys for this change would be ``os_hash_algo`` and ``os_hash_value``. The proposed value is a hash value that is formatted as a sha512 hexdigest. The hexdigest will be obtained using the current python hashlib library. ``os_hash_algo`` will be sha3_512 and ``os_hash_value`` will be the hex. At this point in time, the config will default to sha3_512, but this change will allow us to alter allowed hashing algorithms at any time. The ``os_hash_algo`` field will also allow for users to dynamically pass this value to their python code. We will leave MD5 calculations and checksums for backwards compatibility. Adding a new image will set all of ``checksum``, ``os_hash_algo`` and ``os_hash_value`` fields. Requesting the image metadata of an image without the ``os_hash_algo/os_hash_value`` value set, will result in a null for the ``os_hash_algo/os_hash_value`` field in the metadata response. Alternatives ------------ 1. Update the value of the ``checksum`` field with the hexdigest of a different hashing algorithm. This will likely break client-side checksum verification code. 2. Add only the new ``os_hash_value`` field. While it is a simpler change, it is a less future proof approach because it ties the sha512 algorithm to the ``os_hash_value`` property in the same way that the md5 algorithm is tied to the current ``checksum`` property. When a sha512 collision is produced, there will have to be a new spec in to add yet another checksum field. The approach described in this spec of using an additional ``os_hash_algo`` field will allow changing the hash algorithm without adding a new field or breaking the API contract. All we'll have to do is update the algorithm used and put its name in the ``os_hash_algo`` property, and then any image consumer will know how to interpret what's in the ``os_hash_value`` property. It is worth noting that the Glance implementation of image signature validation gives us a precedent for having a value in one property (``img_signature``) and the name of the algorithm used in another property (``img_signature_hash_method``) [1]_. Thus the proposal in this spec is completely consistent with a related Glance workflow. 3. Use the hexdigest of a different algorithm. Tests using hashlib's sha256 and sha512 algorithms consistently yielded faster times for sha512 (SEE: Performance impact). The implementation of the sha512 algorithm within hashlib demonstrates reasonable performance and should be considered collision-resistant for many years. 4. Implement a single ``multihash`` field in the image metadata in which we calculate the SHA512 value. The single field will contain the coded algorithm name and hash [0]_. The advantage is that it is only one field being added to the data model and schema. However, having only one field would make it difficult to use the hash quickly as the end user would be required to decode what algorithm is being used before verifying the hash.",6,124

I have been serving as the PTL for the last two cycles i.e. Zed and 2023.1 (Antelope) and there were a lot of key areas which we were able to improve as follows: * Review bandwidth and quality: Cinder's policy of ""Do reviews to get reviews"" has helped improve the review bandwidth and we have seen more participation and activity in code reviews. We have also added efficient review guidelines[1] to help new contributors onboard to the review process quickly and help them do quality reviews. * cinderclient to openstackclient migration: We are working towards reducing the parity between cinderclient and openstackclient and the effort can be tracked with this topic[2]. Currently we have proposed all the commands that were missing in openstackclient. * Third party CI to report on os-brick changes: The third party vendor CI's used to report only on cinder gate and not on os-brick gate which means their driver wasn't tested with the connector and they could only see issues when the os-brick release happens. Unfortunately, the driver merge deadline is milestone-2 and os-brick (non-client library) release is 1 week before feature freeze so it doesn't give enough time for driver maintainers to fix the issues. Reporting the CI on os-brick gate helps identify issues earlier and fix them timely. * Security Vulnerabilities: We went through the open security issues in Zed and triaged their priority and importance. A new security issue was reported in 2023.1 regarding VMDK file format for which a CVE has been filed, CVE-2022-47951 [3]. We have addressed the issue and releases were done for the actively maintained stable branches i.e. Zed[1], Yoga[2] and Xena[3]. Apart from that, we were able to handle deadlines better by managing and prioritizing work based on the milestones. Following are the plans for the 2023.2 cycle: * our first target will be to move away from adding additional commands to cinderclient and only rely on openstackclient for the CLI interface. Also we will explore openstacksdk to add support for cinder commands so we can break the dependency on the python bindings that exist in cinderclient. * Another thing to address is adding the service role after the keystone implements it[7]. * Third party drivers are the core of cinder that allows cinder to what the end users desire i.e. to interface between users and storage backends. We will focus to improve the experience of driver vendors to implement new drivers by improving our driver documentation and test stability by doing a 3rd party CI compliance check. We have been making progress in this area but more efforts are required that we will target for the next cycle.

While logging connection info in the glance cinder store driver, we
need to mask passwords for which we use oslo_utils's mask_dict_password

Since this is not mocked in the glance functional tests, we encounter a failure

This patch adds the required mocking to pass the tests.

With change Ic79815972e654a8bfe2775f57c68cfa0bf115e2f, we started
using getaddrinfo method from socket lib to fetch the system
IP address (v4 or v6) and pass it to os-brick.
The test works for most systems since a valid IP is returned but
for some deployments, it fails with the following error.

raise socket.gaierror(socket.EAI_NONAME, 'No address found')

In any case, it is a good practice to mock it in tests.
This patch mocks getaddrinfo in the current cinder store tests.

It seems that in test test_configurations_are_synced_towards_placement
when the fake placement process is stopped it can take longer and
the test restarts the agent before it is really dead.
In this case neutron-server can report the status and the agent's
'resources_synced' field is True when the tests checks it.

A simple workaround for this can be to check if the AsyncProcess
class' _is_running property is False.

While debugging the ``rescue`` test functionality with ironic's
tempest plugin, we discovered that if the environment suggests the
agent is available, then we may enter a situation where the test
can fail because paramiko prefers ssh over password authentication.

This is important, because for rescue functionality in particular,
it is password authentication based without the use of SSH keys,
as a temporary password is generated by the services and provided
to the user requesting to rescue the instance/node.

Instead of trying to make an assumption that password being present
means we should just disable the agent, explicitly allow the caller
to specify it.

Setting ovn-monitor-all to 'true' will configure
ovn-controller to monitor all OVS database records
unconditionally. That will release some CPU resource
from OVS Southbound DB but will increase number of events
coming to ovn-controller.

Default value is 'false'.

In train tempest is pinned to 26.1.0(requires paramkio>=2.7.0)
and since paramiko-3.0.0(requires cryptography>=3.3) release
jobs are failing as they are trying to compile cryptography
which needs rust to be installed or upgrade pip so
cryptography wheel binaries can be installed.

To setup rust ensure-rust role is executed in
pre run.

Also replace integrated-gate and integrated-gate-py3
templates with the required jobs in check and
gate queue as those templates have grenade jobs
in gate queue which are already marked as non-voting[1].

Wallaby branch is in Extended Maintenance now[1]. Tempest and
tempest plugins are branchless which means master version of
Tempest and its plugins is used to test the supported stable
branches.

Once any stable branch is moved to EM state then, Tempest and
its plugins compatible tag[2] needs to be released so that we can
keep testing the EM stable branches with that tag once master
Tempest and its plugins are not compatible[3].

Tagging 'wallaby-last' as well as a new version also with same hash.

Since [1], ``oslo_log.log.setup`` can be called without applying the
fix for eventlet in native threads [2]. This fix clashes with the
oslo.privsep logging handler that replaces the original one. This
handler is implemented to allow the sync between the daemon process
and the process making the privileged call.

Once the oslo.log library version is bumped to 5.0.2, the try clause
can be removed.

We have been using --db-nb-create-insecure-remote=yes - that results
a TCP method is set by ovn-ctl script to run ovsdb-server.

Downside is - we can't configure inactivity probe on that connection.

The SQLite in-memory databases have been great for testing but
as the swift DatabaseBroker's have become more complex, the limitations
of in memory databases are being reached. Mostly due
to the introduction of container sharding where a broker sometimes needs
to make multiple connections to the same database as the same time.

Rather then rework the real broker logic to better support in-memory
testing, it's actually easier to just remove the in-memory broker tests
and use a ""real"" broker in a tempdir. This allows us to better test how
brokers behave in real life, pending files and all.

This patch replaces all the :memory: brokers in the tests with real ones
placed in a tempdir. To achieve this, we new base unittest class `TestDBBase`
has been added that creates, cleans up and provides some helper methods
to manage the db path and location.

Further, all references to :memory: in the Database brokers have been
removed.

The support to extend attached volumes is being added to glance
cinder store with change[1].
Currently, cinder sends external events to nova if the volume is
in ``in-use`` state irrespective of the instance uuid value in the
attachment records.
When using glance cinder store, the instance_uuid field is None in
the attachment record and that signifies that the volume is attached
to glance host and not to a nova instance. We should not send any
external events in this case.

With this change, we check if the instance UUIDs are not None and
send external events to nova. If None, we don't send any external
events.

In the container backend we have a delete_meta_whitelist which
whitelists specific metadata from being cleared when we delete a broker.
Currently the sharding root and quoted root are in there.

They're there because we now process deleted shards and we need to know
what a shard's root is. But since that time we've found and
edge case bug where we've found old sharding brokers that are stuck
because they're deleted (a deleted shard will clear the sysmeta-sharding
truth value), but also has lost their shard-ranges. This makes them fail
the sharding_enabled check and therefore never get a chance to pull new
shard ranges from their root and are therefore stuck.

A deleted shard wont be recreated, so it doesn't hurt to keep this
sharding sysmeta value, and will be an extra line of defence stopping
similar stuck container issues in the future.

I currently serve on the TC and have contributed to mulitple projects over the years within OpenStackas well as being an operator which I feel gives me a well rounded view of what makes OpenStack and how the pieces should work together and what the users need. I feel I represent all members of the community from the small private clouds to the teams running large public clouds. I also feel my experiences helping with OpenStack Upstream Institute, OpenSttack OPS Meetup team, the OpenStack mentoring program, and the Git and Gerrit workshops help me to connect with contributers from those just starting out to those who have been here from the beginning. My main goal for rejoining the TC is to take my experiences with Operators and making sure they have a voice within the our decisions so that we can better meet the needs of our users.

While creating an image, if we want to extend the volume
(to accomodate the image), we need to first detach the volume,
perform the extend and attach it again. This is inefficient
for backends that support extending attached volumes since we
are performing 3 cinder operations (the attachment call
includes 3 API calls which sum to a total of 5 API calls for 3
operations) instead of directly extending it which requires only
1 API call to cinder.
The support for extending attached volumes was added in cinder
microversion 3.42.

This patch adds a new boolean config option
``cinder_do_extend_attached`` which allows operators to specify
if the cinder backend they are using supports extending
attached (in-use) volumes. By default this will be ``false``.
Based on the parameter, we will perform the extend operation,
online (if cinder_do_extend_attached is true) and offline otherwise.

Unlike uwsgi, apache mod_wsgi does not support passing
commandline arguments to the python wsgi script it invokes.

As a result while you can pass --config-file when hosting the
api and metadata wsgi applications with uwsgi there is no
way to use multiple config files with mod_wsgi.

This change mirrors how this is supported in keystone and
nova today by intoducing a new OS_PLACEMENT_CONFIG_FILES
env var to allow operators to optional pass a ';' delimited
list of config files to load.

This reverts commit 7a7a223602ca5aa0aca8f65a6ab143f1d8f8ec1b.

That commit was added because - tl'dr - upon revert resize, Neutron
with the OVS backend and the iptables security group driver would send
us the network-vif-plugged event as soon as we updated the port
binding.

That behaviour has changed with commit 66c7f00e1d9. With that commit,
we started unplugging the vifs on the source compute host when doing a
resize. When reverting the resize, the vifs had to be re-plugged again,
regarldess of the networking backend in use. This renders commit
7a7a223602ca5aa0aca8f65a6ab143f1d8f8ec1b. pointless, and it can be
reverted.

Backport is clean from master, and the TODO that was present in the
commit message on master is removed, as its a driver interface change
and can only be done on master.

Currently the `rbd_secret_uuid` configuration option has no default
value, but at the same time the RBD driver doesn't complain if it's
missing, and will only fail on the Nova side if there is no
`rbd_secret_uuid` configured in the `[LIBVIRT]` section of `nova.conf`.

Using Cinder's `rbd_secret_uuid` has been the preferred way since the
Ocata release.

Most deployments set the `rbd_secret_uuid` value in libvirt's secret to
the Ceph cluster FSID value, and that's what this patch does when it is
not defined.

It doesn't change how replication locations are configured, and those
will still require the secret uuid to be defined.

When migrating/resizing VM to destination
host that has VIF type difference from source VIF
type, it fails due to exception in unplugging
VIF on source host after user perform a confirmation
action.

This change unplugs the vifs in resize_instance and
wraps the call to unplug in confirm with an try except
block. the call to unplug_vifs in confirm is not removed
to support rolling upgrades but a todo is added to remove
it after the Wallaby release.

Currently we don't have os_brick DEBUG log levels in Nova when setting
the service to debug mode.

That happens because Nova is forcefully setting oslo.privsep.daemon
levels to INFO to prevent leaking instance XML details (bug #1784062).

Oslo Privsep now supports per-context debug log levels, so this patch
sets the log level name for its only os_brick privsep context to
""os_brick.privileged"" to differentiate it from the service it runs under
which uses the default ""oslo_privsep.daemon"".

This way even though Nova is still disabling its own privileged calls it
won't affect os-brick privileged calls, allowing us to properly debug
block device attach/detach operations.

When running in check mode, some prechecks previously failed because
they use the command module which is silently not run in check mode.
Other prechecks were not running correctly in check mode due to e.g.
looking for a string in empty command output or not querying which
containers are running.

This change fixes these issues.

We do run update_available_resource() synchronously during service
startup, but we only allow certain exceptions to abort startup. This
makes us abort for InvalidConfiguration, and makes the resource
tracker raise that for the case where the compute node create failed
due to a duplicate entry.

This also modifies the object to raise a nova-specific error for that
condition to avoid the compute node needing to import oslo_db stuff
just to be able to catch it.

By default, first instance's cell are placed to the host's cell with
id 0, so it will be exhausted first. Than host's cell with id 1 will
be used and exhausted. It will lead to error placing instance with
number of cells in NUMA topology equal to host's cells number if

By default ``packing_host_numa_cells_allocation_strategy`` variable is set to ``True``. It leads to attempt to chose NUMA node(s) with less amount of free resources (or in other words **more used** NUMA nodes) first. It is so-called ""pack"" strategy - we try to place as much as possible load at **more used** host's NUMA node until it will be completely exhausted. And only after we will choose **most used** host's NUMA node from the rest available nodes on host. ""Spread"" strategy is reverse to ""pack"" strategy. The NUMA node(s) with **more free** resources will be used first. So ""spread"" strategy will try to balance load between all NUMA nodes and keep number of free resources on all NUMA nodes as more equal as possible. Host's NUMA nodes are placed in list and list is sorted based on strategy chosen and resource available in each NUMA node. Sorts are performed on same list one after another, so the last sort implemented is the sort with most priority. The python performed so-called stable sort. It means that each sort executed on same list will change order of list items only if item's property we sort on differs. If this properties in all list's items are equal than elements order will not changed. Sorts are performed on host's NUMA nodes list in the following order: * sort based on available memory on node(first sort-less priority) * sort based on cpu usage (in case of shared CPUs requested by guest VM topology) or free pinned cpus otherwise. * sort based on number of free PCI device on node(last sort-top priority) Top sorting priority is for host's NUMA nodes with PCI devices attached. If VM requested PCI device(s) logic **always** puts host's NUMA nodes with more PCI devices at the beginnig of the host's NUMA nodes list. If PCI devices isn't requested by VM than NUMA nodes with no (or less) PCI device available will be placed at the beginnig of the list. .. caution:: The described logic for PCI devices is used **both** for ""pack"" and ""spread"" strategies. It is done to keep backward compatibility with previous nova versions. During ""pack"" logic implementation rest (two) sorts are performed with sort order to move NUMA nodes with more available resources (CPUs and memory) at the END of host's NUMA nodes list. Sort based on memory is the first sort implemented and has least priority. During ""spread"" logic implementation rest (two) sorts are performed with sort order to move NUMA nodes with more available resources (CPUs and memory) at the BEGINNING of host's NUMA nodes list. Sort based on memory is the first sort implemented and has least priority. Finally resulting list (after all sorts) is passed next and attempts to place VM's NUMA node to host's NUMA node are performed starting from the first host's NUMA node in list."," The NUMA node(s) used are normally chosen at random. However, if a PCI passthrough or SR-IOV device is attached to the instance, then the NUMA node that the device is associated with will be used. This can provide important performance improvements. However, booting a large number of similar instances can result in unbalanced NUMA node usage. Care should be taken to mitigate this issue.

apt-key is deprecated and in Debian 'bullseye' it complain when we use

The right way is to store key files in separate directory and then, for

If the vnic_type of a bound port changes from ""direct"" to ""macvtap"" and
then the compute service is restarted then during _init_instance nova
tries to plug the vif of the changed port. However as it now has macvtap
vnic_type nova tries to look up the netdev of the parent VF. Still that
VF is consumed by the instance so there is no such netdev on the host
OS. This error killed the compute service at startup due to unhandled
exception. This patch adds the exception handler, logs an ERROR and
continue initializing other instances on the host.

Also this patch adds a detailed ERROR log when nova detects that the
vnic_type changed during _heal_instance_info_cache periodic.

The stable/train only change is due to neutron module rename between
ussuri and train.

If the vnic_type of a bound port changes from ""direct"" to ""macvtap"" and
then the compute service is restarted then during _init_instance nova
tries to plug the vif of the changed port. However as it now has macvtap
vnic_type nova tries to look up the netdev of the parent VF. Still that

Probably because of a new version of docker-ce package
apparmor is not installed by default anymore and
containers can't start because of apparmor_parser is missing.

This patch is adding apparmor package to list of packages to

Adding a backup play to download the cirros deployment image using curl
if get_url fails. get_url will currently by default include
authorization headers after redirection which can in some circumstances
cause 400 errors.

Both get_url and uri have an unredirected_headers

Problem description =================== Currently, it is not possible to update an instance's user data without rebuilding it. Rebuilding takes much more time than just propagating updated user data, e. g. via cloud-init, and may be unfavorable in production. Additionally, other public cloud providers like Azure [1] have the functionality to update user data for an existing instance, so end users may expect this to work in Nova as well. AWS requires the instance to be powered off [2] before updating user data and Google also allows updates at any time [3][4]. | [1] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/user-data#what-is-user-data | [2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html#user-data-view-change | [3] https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/how-to/create-configure-instance#using_cloud-init_with_the_cloud_config_format | [4] https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/setMetadata Use Cases --------- As a user, I want to dynamically reconfigure the time and name servers used by my instance via user data in order to update theses settings using the same interface (user data) I initially used to bootstrap the instance. As a user with experience at provisioning ephemeral workloads with tools like cloud-init, I would like to manage my stateful workload via user data and metadata on each boot. Metadata is used to store my external configuration while user data is used to perform operations like rejoining a cluster when the update has been applied. Proposed change =============== A new server action (``POST /servers/{server_id}/action``) called ``userdata_update`` should be added. This endpoint can be called by the user to request a change in user data. If the instance uses the metadata service, user data will be updated directly, so the updated user data will be available to the instance nearly instantly. The according action state will be set to ``Done``, indicating that the user data has been successfully updated. Otherwise, if the instance uses a config drive, the config drive, holding the user data, requires regeneration. When the action is called, driver support of config drive regeneration is checked. If the used compute driver does not support this feature, a status code of 409 (Conflict) will be returned and the user data cannot be updated. The action state will reflect this as ``Failed``. If the driver supports config drive regeneration, a new variable in the instance's system metadata (``config_drive_regeneration_required``) is set, indicating that the config drive requires a rebuild. In this case, the action state will be set to a new value ``USERDATA_UPDATE_REQUIRES_REBOOT``, informing the user that a reboot is needed in order to complete the user data update. When a reboot is executed, the driver will check for ``config_drive_regeneration_required`` and call its config drive regeneration logic if requested. Depending on the result of the config drive regeneration, the action state will either be set to ``Done`` (if successful) or ``Failed`` if any errors occured during regeneration. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- The ``POST /servers/{server_id}/action`` API is extended by the ``userdata_update`` parameter. This is added in a new microversion. * POST /servers/{server_id}/action .. code-block:: json { ""userdata_update"": { ""userdata"": ""data"", } } The above is an example of a request which changes the user data to ``data``. Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- The option to update user data with openstackclient is required: ``openstack server set --user-data {data} {server_id}`` Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Jan Hartkopf (jhartkopf) Feature Liaison --------------- None Work Items ---------- * Implement API changes * Add tests * Add docs Dependencies ============ * openstackclient needs to be updated to implement this change Testing ======= * Add unit tests (positive and negative) * Add functional test (API samples) Documentation Impact ==================== The API reference needs to be updated to reflect the new microversion's feature. In addition, make clear that user data is mutable but also that it does not replace proper config management.

So far we assiged an ipv4 default value to persistence_granularity when
we created a UDP pool with session persistence.

This patch adds the condition of ipv6 and assigns its matching netmask

Probably because of a new version of docker-ce package
apparmor is not installed by default anymore and
containers can't start because of apparmor_parser is missing.

This patch is adding apparmor package to list of packages to
be installed.

Probably because of a new version of docker-ce package
apparmor is not installed by default anymore and
containers can't start because of apparmor_parser is missing.

This patch is adding apparmor package to list of packages to

Wallaby branch is in Extended Maintenance now[1]. Tempest and
tempest plugins are branchless which means master version of
Tempest and its plugins is used to test the supported stable
branches.

Once any stable branch is moved to EM state then, Tempest and

If there is a failed resize that also failed the cleanup
process performed by _cleanup_remote_migration() the retry
of the resize will fail because it cannot rename the current
instances directory to _resize.

This renames the _cleanup_failed_migration() that does the
same logic we want to _cleanup_failed_instance_base() and
uses it for both migration and resize cleanup of directory.

It then simply calls _cleanup_failed_instances_base() with
the resize dir path before trying a resize.

Hypervisor statistics check has been dropped entirely, as it relies on
API deprecated by I515e484ade6c6455f82a3067940a418a0d7d965a[0]

Since reliable and standard compliant installation of ansible modules
is only possible using a collection, or system package manager,
the ansible-lint settings were adjusted to mock newly introduced modules.

Note about necessary dependencies was added to validation description.

Explanation of the mocks was added to other, previously mocked, modules,
in order to facilitate future development.

Hypervisor statistics check has been dropped entirely, as it relies on
API deprecated by I515e484ade6c6455f82a3067940a418a0d7d965a[0]

Since reliable and standard compliant installation of ansible modules
is only possible using a collection, or system package manager,
the ansible-lint settings were adjusted to mock newly introduced modules.

Note about necessary dependencies was added to validation description.

Explanation of the mocks was added to other, previously mocked, modules,
in order to facilitate future development.

When running in check mode, some prechecks previously failed because
they use the command module which is silently not run in check mode.
Other prechecks were not running correctly in check mode due to e.g.
looking for a string in empty command output or not querying which
containers are running.

This change fixes these issues.

When running in check mode, some prechecks previously failed because
they use the command module which is silently not run in check mode.
Other prechecks were not running correctly in check mode due to e.g.
looking for a string in empty command output or not querying which
containers are running.

This change fixes these issues.

VMDK:
When parsing a VMDK file to calculate its size, the format_inspector
determines the location of the Descriptor section by reading two
uint64 from the headers of the file and uses them to create the
descriptor CaptureRegion.

It would be possible to craft a VMDK file that commands the
format_inspector to create a very big CaptureRegion, thus exhausting
resources on the glance-api process.

This patch binds the beginning of the descriptor to 0x200 and limits
the size of the CaptureRegion to 1MB, similar to how the VMDK
descriptor is parsed by qemu.

VHDX:
It is a bit more involved, but similar: when looking for the
VIRTUAL_DISK_SIZE metadata, the format_inspector was creating an
unbounded CaptureRegion.

In the same way as it seems to be done in Qemu, we now limit the upper
bound of this CaptureRegion.

With the new version of tox the parsing of postargs value has changed.
Previously an empty string was discarded by tox if it appeared in the
postargs value in contrast with the latest version of tox which
leaves the empty string intact.

The behavior of the latest tox version makes some jobs fail as some
variables in the run-tempest role have an empty string as a default
value. This leads in some cases to the execution of an incorrect tempest
command, for example:

tempest run --regex '[.*\bsmoke\b.*]' '' --concurrency=2

The patch changes the default value for blacklist_option,
exclude_list_option and tempest_test_regex variables to None to prevent
an empty string from being passed to postargs variable in tox.

This adds support for the per-role container image prepare params
into the undercloud-deploy role. See [1] for other related patches.

The undercloud-mixed-os play is changed to resolve the rhel/centos8
ci-testing hash for periodic jobs before undercloud-deploy for the
multi container prep.

Vars are being set with [2] but the single deploy workflow will
not be enabled until [3] merges.
