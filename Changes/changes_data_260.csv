As we aren't required to re-deploy any more during the converge step
the actions performed by the Upgrade Converge and Prepare are exactly
the same, the only difference is the lifecycle environment file we
use to set and unset parameters.

This patch refactors both classes, the UpgradePrepare and UpgradeConverge
clasess:

- UpgradePrepare: Stop forcing update-plan-only and then try to do most of the
actions from deployment into UpgradePrepare. This change will force config_download
to false (which will avoid running the full deployment and do only an stack update),
then download the config by invoking get_config from package_update and lastly
enable ssh into overcloud nodes, as that part is perforemd in deployment only if
config_download is set to true. Add new attributes to UpgradePrepare so we can

The rate value is converted to bytes per second before being
sent to Pyroute2, but it used the wrong value for the calculations.
This resulted in incorrect rates.
It should be multiplied by 1000 (kbit), not 1024 (Kibit).

In case when physical bridge is removed and created again it
is initialized by neutron-ovs-agent.
But if agent has enabled distributed routing, dvr related
flows wasn't configured again and that lead to connectivity issues
in case of DVR routers.

This patch fixes it by adding configuration of dvr related flows
if distributed routing is enabled in agent's configuration.

It also adds reset list of phys_brs in dvr_agent. Without that there
were different objects used in ovs agent and dvr_agent classes thus
e.g. 2 various cookie ids were set on flows in physical bridge.
This was also the same issue in case when openvswitch was restarted and
all bridges were reconfigured.
Now in such case there is correctly new cookie_id configured for all
flows.

There are different situations when allocations can be orphaned.
Adding a new nova-manage command to lookup at all resource providers
and check against the related compute nodes whether they have
orphaned allocations.

NOTE(artom) Conflicts and notes:

* The big one is conflicts caused by 6b6d81cf2b and the
  bp/placement-mirror-host-aggregates series being absent in queens.
  Git gets tremendously confused about the absence of that code around
  this backport's additions, but all the conflicts actually have an
  easy manual resolution: don't include any of the surrounding code
  in this backport. The ResourceProviderNotFound exception is - wait
  for it - an exception, and it's included here.

* Test inheritance had to be adjusted because in queens the
  ProviderUsageBaseTestCase is in
  nova/tests/functional/test_servers.py and not
  nova/tests/functional/integrated_helpers.py

* mock, collections, oslo_serialization jsonutils, and fake_requests
  imports had to be added.

* ResourceClass is in nova/objects/fields.py instead of its own
  nova/rc_fields. Adjust the import.

* To get get_allocations_for_consumer() to include the entire JSON
  response, the include_project_user param is used instead of its
  future replacement, include_generation.

* The ALLOCATION_PROJECT_USER placement API microversion is used
  instead of CONSUMER_GENERATION_VERSION, which doesn't exist yet.

This adds a new CLI which will iterate all non-cell0
cells looking for instances that (1) have a host,
(2) aren't undergoing a task state transition and
(3) don't have allocations in placement and try
to allocate resources, based on the instance embedded
flavor, against the compute node resource provider
on which the instance is currently running.

This is meant as a way to help migrate CachingScheduler
users off the CachingScheduler by first shoring up
instance allocations in placement for any instances
created after Pike, when the nova-compute resource
tracker code stopped creating allocations in placement
since the FilterScheduler does it at the time of
scheduling (but the CachingScheduler doesn't).

This will be useful beyond just getting deployments
off the CachingScheduler, however, since operators
will be able to use it to fix incorrect allocations
resulting from failed operations.

There are several TODOs and NOTEs inline about things
we could build on top of this or improve, but for now
this is the basic idea.

NOTE(artom) Trivial-ish conflicts in nova/exception.py due to
different exceptions around the newly added one.

There are different situations when allocations can be orphaned.
Adding a new nova-manage command to lookup at all resource providers
and check against the related compute nodes whether they have
orphaned allocations.

NOTE(artom) The following changes had to be made, mostly in
nova/cmd/manage.py.

* os_resoure_classes did not exist in rocky, it is replaced with
  nova.rc_fields.ResourceClass

* The NET_BW_* and PCPU resource classes are part of the
  bandwidth resource provider series (bp/bandwidth-resource-provider)
  and CPU resource series (bp/cpu-resources), which landed in stein
  and train respectively. They are removed.

* As is_cell_failure_sentinel() only appeared in 031314b6d8, use
  context.raised_exception_sentinel instead.

* In rocky get_allocations_for_resource_provider() returns the JSON
  allocations directly, code that uses its return value had to be
  adjusted, as well as the the
  test_check_orphaned_allocations_for_provider() code that mocks it.

* In rocky get_allocs_for_consumer() did not exist yet - switch to
  using get_allocations_for_consumer().

* In rocky delete_allocation_for_instance() does not accept a
  consumer_type param, cannot raise anything, and directly returns
  True or False. Adjust the code that calls it accordingly.

* The stable-only put_allocs() method from the stein backport is
  modified to take into account put_allocations()'s inability to
  raise. It not just return True or False based on the HTTP code from
  placement.

* The ProviderAllocInfo namedtuple from f534495a42
  had to be included in the backport because the unit tests need it.

There are different situations when allocations can be orphaned.
Adding a new nova-manage command to lookup at all resource providers
and check against the related compute nodes whether they have
orphaned allocations.

NOTE(artom) Notes about nova/cmd/manage.py:

* Trivial conflict due to imports

* collections was missing from imports and had to be added

* The trait MEM_ENCRYPTION_CONTEXT was introduced by the AMD-SEV
  series (bp/amd-sev-libvirt-support), did not exist in stein, and had
  to be removed.

* A new stable-only put_allocs() method was necessary because the
  existing put_allocations() in stein does not allow us to remove
  resource providers from the request.

OS_AUTH_URL isn't versioned (e.g., https://keystone.example.com/ instead

Manila's tempest tests create test credentials on
the fly using tempest's dynamic test credential
framework. Launchpad bug 1883795 points to an issue
where we're forcing the creation of test accounts dynamically
even when ""[auth]/use_dynamic_credentials"" has been set
to False. The appropriate fix [0] for that bug is to
skip tests that *require* a new test credential.
This leads us to lose test coverage in such a situation.
Currently, manila tempest tests cannot be run reliably
with dynamic credentials when testing DHSS=True drivers.
See bugs [1][2][3][4]; So these tests use the
pre-provisioned test credentials framework
as a workaround. We plan to fix this soon [5].

In the meantime, we don't want to lose test coverage
by turning off dynamic credentials all the time.

So ensure we're running with dynamic creds turned on
for all test jobs except the DHSS=True jobs. After
[5] merges, we can turn on dynamic credentials
everywhere.

Previously some tests were ignored under python 3 environment, this was
due to some design changes introduced by python 3.7 [1] in the SSL
module of the stdlib. These changes reactivate some of them (some other
are still skipped and needs further works).

Indeed, when we try to use requests with SSL in a monkey patched
environment we faced the following issue:

```
TypeError: wrap_socket() got an unexpected keyword argument '_context'
```

This is due to the fact that we are in a monkey patched environment
where `requests` is monkey patched too.

We don't need `request` for our needs. Indeed we can easily send
http requests through low level socket. Our main goal is to test
our wsgi server and not to test the `requests` library, and `requests`
was just used to make the code more simpler.

In our case we can implement a code dedicated to send request to our green
server, unlock our tests and move away from this bug/side effect.

Also this reactivated test will check WSGI server with and without SSL,
so these changes add changes that allow us to submit a request without
wrapping the socket with SSL.

These changes move away from `requests` which is badly monkey patched by
eventlet [1]. Now we use monkey patched socket and ssl to
request the green server which is executed in background. Low level
(monkey patched) modules could help us to skirt layers that are possibly
badly monkey patched on higher level modules (urllib, requests, etc...).

Previously these tests was ignored surely because the WSGI tests
with SSL were broken due to some design changes introduced by python 3.7 [1]
in the SSL module of the stdlib.

However, unlike the other WSGI/SSL tests these changes don't use
the `requests` module or high level modules which are broken by
the monkey patching of the stdlib.

I suppose previous developers simply turned off all of tests related to
WSGI/SSL without much more details than ""SSL tests with python 3 and eventlet
is broken"" but some of them don't need much more work than just reactivate
them to be ran successfully.

This test seems to work without change, and it run successfully locally.

Let reactivate this test.

We need to make some changes in order to allow policy deprecation without causing pain to OpenStack deployers. Problem description =================== There is an intersection of a few separate but related things that are causing pain when deprecating policies: * Packagers like to generate a sample policy for users to reference as they configure a service. * oslo.policy still defaults the filename of the policy file to policy.json for backward compatibility reasons. This encourages packages to generate a JSON sample policy file, which is not what we want. * Generating a sample policy file in JSON results in all the policy-in-code rules being overridden because it is not possible to comment out the default rules in JSON. Because of the above, when a policy rule is deprecated in a service, users who have a JSON sample policy file will have the new rule applied immediately on upgrade. This does not give them a chance to deal with the change, as intended by the deprecation mechanism in oslo.policy (which would ordinarily apply an OR operation on the old rule and the new rule to ensure environments relying on the old rule will continue to work). Proposed change =============== We want to officially deprecate JSON file format support and switch the oslo.policy default to YAML. In order to do this, we will need careful coordination with consumers of oslo.policy. It is dangerous to change the default value for ``policy_file`` without making every effort to communicate the change to deployers. If a deployer misses this change, it is possible that their custom policy may fail to be applied, creating significant security problems. The proposal made here is for each project to add an upgrade check that will look for a JSON-formatted policy file and fail if one is found. Once a project has this check in place, they can use `set_defaults <https://opendev.org/openstack/oslo.policy/src/branch/master/oslo_policy/opts.py#L121>`_ to change the default value for ``policy_file`` to ``policy.yaml``. A release note about the change should be added to each project as well. To facilitate this migration, we should write a tool to migrate an existing policy to YAML. The tool would make the format change, and it should also comment out any rules that match the default from policy-in-code. Only rules that have actually been customized by the deployer should be present in the resulting file. We may be able to use the `oslopolicy-policy-upgrade <https://opendev.org/openstack/oslo.policy/src/branch/master/oslo_policy/generator.py#L389>`_ tool to do this. In parallel we can officially deprecate JSON format support in oslo.policy. If we detect that a JSON file is in use for policy we should log a warning. Support for JSON in CLI tools will also need to be deprecated. We may also want to make existence of a JSON file a hard error on the oslo.policy side. We could provide a flag that services can set once they have completed their migration to YAML. If that flag is set and we find a policy.json file that would be a fatal error and stop the service from even starting. That would prevent us from silently opening security holes in a deployment. Alternatives ------------ Leave things as they are and try to communicate better that deployers should be using YAML. This was essentially the original plan around policy-in-code and it has obviously not been effective. Impact on Existing APIs ----------------------- Support for policy files in JSON format will be deprecated. Security impact --------------- Policy has a significant security impact so we need to be very careful with how we make this change. It will require coordination with Oslo consumers to ensure we make the change in the safest way possible. Performance Impact ------------------ None in the short term. When JSON support is removed we will be able to stop checking for JSON formatted files which may slightly improve performance when reading policy files. Configuration Impact -------------------- The default value for the ``policy_file`` option in oslo.policy will change from ``policy.json`` to ``policy.yaml``. Developer Impact ---------------- Each project will need an upgrade check to warn users who still have a JSON policy file present. Each project will need to override the ``policy_file`` default once they have added an upgrade check. Testing Impact -------------- We will want to come up with a test matrix covering all the possible cases we may encounter. For example, deployers may have: * policy.json * policy.yaml * both policy.json and policy.yaml * a JSON file at a custom path * a YAML file at a custom path We need to make sure to test all of those to ensure we do the right thing. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ??? Other contributors: ??? Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: Work Items ---------- * Coordinate with other projects to add upgrade checks and change the default for ``policy_file``. * Provide a tool to convert existing policy files to YAML, preferrably with functionality to comment out any rules from the original file that match the default from policy-in-code. * Once all projects have upgrade checks in place, change the default for ``policy_file`` in oslo.policy so all future projects will have the correct default. * Deprecate JSON support in oslo.policy. * Deprecate JSON output in policy CLI tools. Documentation Impact ==================== Release notes to warn deployers about this will be important. Per-project documentation advising against JSON may also be helpful. Note that the oslo.policy docs already recommend using YAML over JSON. Dependencies ============ We will need all projects to have upgrade checks in place in order to safely change this default.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Use network as topology distribution topic ========================================== # TODO: add bp link Problem Description =================== The selective topology distribution brings several advantages in large deployment environment. * The data of subscribed topic will be cached locally. It makes the Dragonflow controller doesn't have to cache all the data, and saves the memory in the host, which has Dragonflow controller running. * The Dragonflow controller will only subscribe to the topic that it concerns. Comparing to subscribe all the changes, this improves the performance of Dragonflow controller. * Using topic to manage data is easier when amount of data is huge. Currently, selective topology distribution uses tenant ID of resources as topic. This fits perfectly in the VPC(virtual private cloud) scenario. In a VPC, all resources comes from one tenant. But as [#]_ described, if there are multiple VPCs in one tenant, using tenant ID as topic will cause redundant event and redundant cache. .. [#] ./selective_topo_dist.rst OpenStack Neutron, as the current Northboud interface of Dragonflow, itself has a more sophisticated way to manage tenant. Administrator in any tenant can basically view and use any resource in the current Neutron scope. With the consideration of RBAC(role based access control), normal user can use resource in other tenants. So, operating resources across multiple tenants is legal from Neutron side. But using tenant ID as topic in selective topology distribution, will not work in such scenarios. The resources in different tenants don't know each other. Resources are not subscribed to the changes of resources in other tenants. Dragonflow controller will not cache resources in irrelative tenants. Now, Dragonflow doesn't have the information of Keystone user, nor does it have any information of RBAC. With these information, it is possible to use tenant ID as topic in multi-tenants scenarios. But things will become overwhelming complex. An alternative to use Dragonflow in mult-tenant scenarios, is to disable selective topology distribution. This will lose the advantages mentioned above. Proposed Change =============== The proposed change will not change the essence of selective topology distribution. And the proposed change will still keep the possiblity to use tenant ID as topic. OpenStack Neutron has several basic resources. They are port, subnet and network. All other resources are associated to basic resources. Port, subnet and network have many-to-one relationship. This spec proposes to use network ID as the topic. So, for the basic resources(ie. port and network), the topic will be the network ID, which can be obtained from their attributes. For other resources, for example QoS policy, it will be pulled when the port is online from Southbound, if it is associated to a port. And its topic will be updated to contain the network ID of the port. In the case of the QoS is used by ports in different networks, the topic of QoS will be plural. So, when the QoS is updated from Northbound api, the change might be published to multiple channels. The topology module in Dragonflow will be refactor. The tenant specified code will be extracted into a separate module. A new module for using network ID as topic will be added. The topology module will load corresponding module according to the topic strategy. Configuration Impact -------------------- Add a new configuration option, *topic_type*. Its possible value will be tenant or network. When it is specified as `tenant`, Dragonflow will behave the same as current selective topology distribution. When it is specified as `network`, Dragonflow will use network ID as topic. NB Data Model Impact -------------------- Change the topic field of current Northbound DB models from a string to a list of string. When use `tenant` as topic_type, the topic will always be a one element list, whose value is the tenant of current resource. Rename the method parameter in Northbound DB drivers from topic to tenant. So that when topic_type is `tenant`, nothing will be affect. Besides, topic should be the concept in Publisher and Subscriber, not in the Northbound DB. Publisher Subscriber Impact --------------------------- There will be no change in Subscriber. Publisher will be changed to be able to send message to multiple channels. This means the `send_event` in Publisher will accept a list or a set of topics. Dragonflow DB CLI Impact ------------------------ None Dragonflow Applications Impact ------------------------------ None Installed flows Impact ---------------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: `xiaohhui <https://launchpad.net/~xiaohhui>`_ Work Items ---------- #. Rename the parameter of Northbound DB driver from topic to tenant. #. Change the topic field of Northbound DB to a list of string. #.

Problem Description =================== At this moment, our DNAT implements its own provider network access and performs its routing in and out of tenant network. This forces it to handle its own ICMP cases separately. TODO Proposed Change =============== We propose the following changes: * Simplify ICMP / TTL handling by unifying it to a single app or lib. * Transform DNAT app to become a translation unit and rely on L3 app to perform the required routing (which will obsolete the need for TTL handling) * Use provider network to forward packets in and out of floating ports. Using floating ports -------------------- We would like to bind floating ports of floating ips to the chassis which host the actual VM ports, and that way make the apps (including provider app) aware of those ports. Once we have floating ports as local ports in the provider network, we can forward their traffic to the L3 tables as if it was regular ports. This will interconnect VMs in provider network and VMs with floating IPs. DNAT ---- DNAT app will be simple, as now we only need to insert flows into EGRESS_TABLE (where packets will go post L2_LOOKUP_TABLE) that translate IP_DST, and forward it to the L3_TABLE for routing. :: Ingress: +------+ set reg7 +---------+ remap dst +---------+ | LOCAL| | LOCAL | | | | L2 +------------> EGRESS +--------------> L3 | | | | | | | +------+ +---------+ +---------+ Egress: +------+ +---------+ restore dst +---------+ | | | PROVIDER| | PROVIDER| | L3 +-------------> EGRESS +-------------> L2 | | | | | | | +------+ +---------+ +---------+ TTL treatment ------------- Since DNAT no longer decrements IP's TTL, all TTL expired treatment will be done by L3 app. ICMP translation for NAT apps ----------------------------- Both SNAT and DNAT need to handle thier inbound and outbound ICMP error messages, and translate the addresses in the embedded packet. We propose adding a new NAT-aware app that will intercept all ICMP error packets and preform the needed translations for both DNAT and SNAT. ",,81,0

Those features attracted some attention in the community it might be benefitial to expose those independently of deploying Dragonflow as the main agent. Proposed Change =============== In a system where DF's local controller runs it does not make sense running an L3 flavor separately, so in the context of this spec we'll only consider deployments with other L2 agent types. In those deployments, each compute node will have to run a DF flavored L3 agent on top of an OVS bridge. The system will have the following Dragonflow-related components: * L3 router service provider Very similar to present day L3 router plugin * L3 agent for each controll node An local-controller based service with a partial set of apps: * L3 * NAT apps * Agent specific classification/dispatch - apps that capture L3 bound packets into agent's bridge, and returns them post routing back to the L2 agent. * north-bound database and pub-sub * partial ML2 mech driver The last 2 points are agnostic and can be deployed in exactly the same manner.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ==================================== Example Spec - The title of your RFE ==================================== Work will be tracked under the following bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/dragonflow/+bug/1716933 This feature discusses the removal of _multiproc_ publishers, and allow only _broker_ publishers, i.e. publisher's which have a broker service (e.g. redis). In order to support full pluggability, it is also proposed to add a ZMQ-based broker implementation. Problem Description =================== Our _multiproc_ pub/sub mechanism is proving to not work as well as it should. _multipoc_ means that we run a process per controller node (which contains the neutron server), which binds the network socket and sends the events. The neutron servers (forked one per cpu) connect to that service via IPC (read unix socket) and send the events to it. In essence, it is a publisher proxy. In essence, this solution is reducible to our current pub/sub solution. But we won't use that reduction, because we want to support active_port_detection and the neutron notifier (which should be rewritten as well, but that's orthogonal) At the end of the day, in the Dragonflow scheme of things, a brokerless solution just doesn't work. We see that since from the get-go (almost) we hacked around it by making a 'multiproc' publisher. This is especially noticeable when we want to publish messages from compute nodes (running the Dragonflow local controller) as well, e.g. neutron notifier only works with Redis. On standalone machines (both server and compute), we see port binding collisions. Open question: * How do we make it truly distributed? * If and How do we do broker-side filtering? * It is preferable to use an out-of-tree, existing solution. Which one to take? * How to integrate with devstack (Not exactly an open question, but should be part of the implementation) Proposed Change =============== We propose to design a way for the ZMQ driver to be a broker. e.g. write a ZMQ-based pub/sub broker. Neutron server (the 'publishers') connect with a PULL/PUSH socket - that's the pattern for many publishers, few subscribers. The subscribers connect with a PUB/SUB socket - that's the pattern for many subscribers, few publishers. There are many interesting ideas in this regard in [1]_. TBD References ========== ..

IPSet

Currently, those aggregated addresses are saved by IPSet, causes
all addresses need be took into count when computing the CIDRs
if any address is added to or removed from those addresses.
In large scale, that will cause performance problem as described
in the bug comments.
This patch will change to use a new class named CIDRList to save those
addresses, so only related CIDRs will be renew computed when changes
happened.
CIDRList class provides those methods:
1) get_cidr_list
2) add_addresses_and_get_changes
3) remove_addresses_and_get_changes
4) update_addresses_and_get_changes

There is already a APP to detect the active port
which actually use the address of allowed address pairs,
but L2/L3 apps don't yet add the corresponding process
about the detected active port.
This patch will add L2 app process about active port.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =============== VM Level QoS =============== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/dragonflow/+spec/vm-qos Problem Description =================== The user would like to define a QoS policy of max/min bandwidth per a VM instance which include all of the VM virtual NICs/ports. This feature should work in conjunction with the Neutron QoS API [1] which allows the user to define QoS policy per Neutron port, this should still work after this design. Proposed Change =============== The following is the needed changes in the pipeline and data model in order to support this feature: Data model changes ------------------- New table is added which holds QoS policy with min/max bandwidth and burst fields. Another table is added to hold reference of VM instance id and QoS profile id. On delete of a QoS profile id, all entries assigning VM's to this profile should also be deleted (another option would be to block the profile deletion in case it is in use) Following the tables definitions: CREATE TABLE qos_policy ( policy_id CHAR(256) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, max_kbps INT(20) max_burst_kbps INT(20) ); CREATE TABLE vm_qos_policy ( instance_id CHAR(256) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, qos_policy_id CHAR(256) ); Pipeline changes ----------------- The following diagram depicts the packets flow for a VM with a QoS policy assigned too, for illustration purposes the VM has 3 different virtual Neutron ports:: Apply QoS on eth-VM or on eth-VM-loopback (rate limit or +---------+ queueing possible) | | | VM | | | +-+--+--+-+ | | | +----------> | | | | | Ports 1,2,3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | +-+-+ +-v-+ | | | eth-VM | | | | eth-VM-loopback +-v--v+-v-------------+-+------+-+-+--------------------------------+ | | | | | | | | | | | | | v | | | | | | +-------------->+ Convert packet mark to metadata | | (network) | | and to reg6=port id | | mark packet | | with port id | | (1,2,3) | | And send to | | eth pair port | | for this VM | | | | | +-------------------------------------------------------------------+ The following steps explains the pipeline: 1) When QoS policy is attached to a certain VM an eth-pair is created and looped back to OVS br-int. (eth-VM and eth-VM-loopback) 2) The classify flows on table 0 for ports 1,2 and 3 are converted to set packet mark to the port id and output to eth-VM port 3) QoS policy can be applied on eth-VM-loopback for rate limit or on eth-VM for queueing. 4) Add classify flows for table 0, inport=eth-VM-loopback and set metadata (network_id) and reg6=port_id according to packet mark (similar to original classify flows) in order to implement this the following table is added:: +----------------+ +----------+ | | | | | Table 0 | | QoS | +--------> Port +----->+ Ingress +-----> Next table in pipeline | classify | | | | | | | | | | | +----------------+ +----------+ The QoS ingress table is empty by default When a VM is attached to a certain QoS profile for the first time: 1) An eth pair connected as loop back on br-int is added with the instance id for the pair port names (by QoS application) (port names eth-VM and eth-VM-loopback) 2) For all the VM local ports a flow is added to the QoS Ingress table: match: reg6=port_id => action: set packet_mark = port_id, output to eth-VM 3) Every time a local port is added/removed the QoS update the QoS Ingress table accordingly (see (2) for flows syntax) 4) Every flow on table 0 must go to the QoS Ingress table (change in L2 application) The default flow in QoS Ingress table is added to go to the next table in the pipeline. 5) QoS application adds a classifier flows for each VM local port on Table 0: match: in_port=eth-VM-loopback, pkt_mark=port_id => action: set reg6=port_id, metadata=network_id In this case needs to jump to the next table after QoS Ingress (Otherwise we will create a loop) 6) QoS application must apply policy on either eth-VM or eth-VM-loopback ports of OVS References ========== [1] http://docs.openstack.org/mitaka/networking-guide/adv-config-qos.html ",,141,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =================== Import from Neutron =================== launchpad RFE: https://bugs.launchpad.net/dragonflow/+bug/1742621 Import from Neutron will allow us to both integrate into existing running environment, taking all currently active configuration from the Neutron DB, adding DragonFlow-enabled nodes. It will also allow users to migrate from a setup running with Neutron reference implementation to DragonFlow enabled one. Problem Description =================== Currently the only valid installation of DragonFlow is clean install (upgrade from previous DragonFlow is soon to come). We would like to support the following use case: Adding DragonFlow nodes to an existing environment running other openstack networking implementations (e.g. reference implementation), this will allow a deployer to evaluate the solution with little/no effect on the existing environment. As DragonFlow will have the entire network information, it will allow phasing out the previous implementation and moving to a pure DragonFlow environment. Proposed Change =============== Final objective: This solution will rely on the application decoupling spec [1]. Each application will define the objects that are of interest to it. For each of these objects, a conversion class should be supplied. If the conversion class resides in an external project, a reference to that project must be supplied as well. Note that it is up to the application to make sure that if an object is dependent on another object, a converter for the latter should exist. .. code:: python class SomeApp(AppBase): schematic = Contract( # List of application states states=(), # Outwards facing variables public_mapping=VariableMapping(), # Internal variables private_mapping=VariableMapping(), entrypoints=(), ) neutron_convert = Converter( # Interesting neutron tables # Converting classes ) TODO: How do we specify this reference? can we add it to the requirements? We should make sure the project is there. Also, what happens if two apps need the same objects, but define different converters? When the application starts, it checks if the northbound DB contains the relevant table, if it does not, it will start converting the objects from the Neutron DB to the DragonFlow northbound DB (making sure to convert the underlying objects before it - to prevent dependency violation). Intermediate solution: We will have a CLI command that will iterate over the defined applications and run the conversion code for each.

For running dragonflow without depend on neutron (use-cases: direct kuryr support or running with dragonflow independence api) a distributed lock that not relying neutron DB should be present. Proposed solution: ================== Currently this spec suggest 3 options , the purpose is to create a discussion about which option should be better. when we get to agreement about one of the options , a full spec should be provided option 1 - add to db-api ""lock"" and ""unlock"" operations ------------------------------------------------------- 2 function will be added to db-api: * Acquire-lock * Release-lock And each db driver should implement them. While in etcd [#]_, redis [#]_ and zookeeper [#]_ distributed-lock is supported in native way -in cassandra, ramcloud , and rethink it's not supported natively and require an lock logic implementation above the current features of the DB. (in cassandra maybe the ""Lightweight Transaction"" [#]_ can be used for locks, and it's possible over Rethink as it's implemented by NoBrainer [#]_ ( a ruby ORM for rethink DB). pros: * The native implantation for redis, etcd and zookeeper. * Reuse the northbound db for create the lock cons: * cassandra/rethink/ramcloud - None native implantation , it's will be hard to implement , and it had more chances to bugs. option 2 - use dedicated db for locks ------------------------------------- Create a software module that use a dedicate DB for manging the locks. The db that will used for creating the lock will used in addition to the northbound db. The db could be mysql,redis,etcd or zookeeper or any other suitable db. This DB should be will not be related to the nb_api in any way . pros: * Single code for lock implementation * Choose the must appropriate DB to the task. * similar to the code today - separate db for locks cons: * Another DB in the system. option 3 - run a lock algorithm without db ------------------------------------------ There is many distribute locks algorithms , for example : , paxos [#]_ , 2PC [#]_ and others (there is interesting discussion about those algorithms for choosing CAS algorithm for cassandra [#]_). We need choose suitable and simple algorithm , and it's can be implemented above ZMQ. pros: * No dependency on DB at all. cons: * Hard to impalement with many corner-cases and potential bugs. ..

DO NOT MERGE

One of the things we discussed at the PTG in the neutron-lib section [1]
is that neutron-lib-current consumers [2] should be using git source
for their required-projects in the gate rather than using those projects
from PyPI. This includes python based jobs (pep8, py3, etc.) as well
as functional devstack based jobs.

This patch tests if neutron is being pulled from git master source or
from PyPI by trying to access a module that's recently deleted from
neutron.

The translation team is focussing on translation of UI/horizon dashboard
projects, so let's only enable translation of stable branches on
these projects.

The list of UI/dashboard projects has been checked with
https://opendev.org/openstack/horizon/src/branch/master/tools/list-horizon-plugins.py

It thus makes the following projects have stable branches translated:
networking-bgpvpn
cloudkitty-dashboard

It marks other repos as only translating on master, since mainly release
notes translation happens there (releasenotes are only translated on
master).

This command removes all QoS rules matching a set of keys and
expected values passed in the command instantiation. No exception
is thrown if no QoS is found with the required external IDs.

For example, this will be used in Neutron to delete all QoS

the floating IP register UUID.

The __future__ module [1] was used in this context to ensure compatibility
between python 2 and python 3.

We previously dropped the support of python 2.7 [2] and now we only support
python 3 so we don't need to continue to use this module and the imports
listed below.

On ppc64le volumes are not discovered on running cinder backup commands.
In the backup logs the following error message is seen:
    _get_host_devices() missing 1 required positional argument:'lun'

Have added additional methods :
    __get_possible_volume_paths()
    __get_possible_paths_by_wwn()

Also modified the _get_host_devices() method to:
    - add the lun argument
    - a check for whether the host is a standalone host using PCI or an NPIV guest using FC path
    - returning the host devices accordingly

Tested cinder backup-create with this change - successful.

Recent changes in some versions of iproute2 CLI output (v4.18),
have invalidated the regular expression used to parse the
""ip link"" output.

To solve this problem and avoid future ones, pyroute2 is used to
retrieve the virtual functions information and set the VF attributes
(spoofcheck, min_tx_rate, max_tx_rate and link_state).

pyroute2 extended the ""ip link"" support to retrieve this information,
adding ""ext_mask=1"" in the get command. If no virtual functions are
present in this particular network interface, the added method,
""get_link_vfs"",  will return an empty list.

The set commands can return a ""InterfaceOperationNotSupported"" in
case the operation is not supported. For min_tx_rate, if the driver
does not support to set a minimum bandwidth, an ""InvalidArgument""
(from a pyroute2.NetlinkError(22)) exception will be raised.

The dynamic concurrency change[1] causes an issue when the instance
list is empty because the thread pool is created with max_workers=0.

This change avoids this issue by exiting the provision function early
if the instances list is empty.

This adds a tools/ script that checks any cherry-picked hashes
on the current commit (or a provided commit) to make sure that
all the hashes exist on at least master or stable/.* branches.
This should help avoid accidentally merging stable backports
where one of the hashes along the line has changed due to conflicts.

Cross model relations --------------------- Juju relations that are added between applications that reside in separate Juju models are called `Cross model relations`_ (CMR). For a Charmed OpenStack deployment, CMR support must also be present in terms of the manner in which the charms are combined. The OpenStack Charms do not generically support CMR. .. important:: It is recommended to exercise each new CMR scenario in a lab environment before committing to that topology in production. The current list of supported CMR scenarios with regard to OpenStack Charms is as follows: #. The keystone application in one model, related to the vault application in a second model. #. The ceph-mon application in one model, related to the ceph-rbd-mirror application in a second model. This scenario is documented in `Ceph RBD mirroring`_. #. A ceph-radosgw application in one model, related to another ceph-radosgw application in a second model. This scenario is documented in `Ceph RADOS Gateway multisite replication`_. Other scenarios may work but are currently not supported. Distinct development and testing efforts are required in order to qualify each unique CMR scenario. If you would like to help drive the development work towards implementing a supported CMR scenario file a Launchpad bug describing your use case.

Queens runs on CentOS7/RHEL8. Train runs on CentOS7 upstream,
but only RHEL8 downstream.

It is vastly impractical for a large compute environment to
upgrade the entire environment in one go. Typically there is
a need to do so in batches. Part of the process requires
ensuring that the compute service from Train is running on
the RHEL7 hypervisor so that we can live-migrate instances
between the RHEL7 hypervisor and a RHEL8 hypervisor.

This allows us to evacuate a hypervisor on RHEL7, upgrade or
replace it, then migrate instances on to it and continue
rolling to the next compute host.

This patch introduces this 'hybrid' state to make this
possible.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================================= Support VNF update operations based on ETSI NFV-SOL specification ================================================================= https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tacker/+spec/support-etsi-nfv-specs ETSI specifications within the NFV Architecture Framework [#etsi_nfv]_ describe the main aspects of NFV development and usage based on of the industry needs, feedback from SDN/NFV vendors and telecom operators. These specifications include the REST API and data model architecture which is used by NFV users and developers in related products. Problem description =================== In the current Tacker implementation based on ETSI NFV-SOL, Tacker uses its own API which describes VNF update operations which is Ability to execute a VNF application software modification. However, these operations are not aligned with the current ETSI NFV data-model. As a result, there might be lack of compatibility with `3rd party VNFs` [#etsi_plugtest2]_, as they are developed according to ETSI NFV specifications. Support of key ETSI NFV specifications will significantly reduce efforts for Tacker integration into Telecom production networks and also will simplify further development and support of future standards. Proposed change =============== Introduce a new interface for updating information about a VNF instance. The operation provided through this interface is: * Modify VNF The following items can be updated by this operation.: - vnfInstanceName - vnfInstanceDescription - vnfdId - metadata - vimConnectionInfo 1) Flow of the Modify VNF Information operation (change vnfdId) --------------------------------------------------------------- Precondition: The resource representing the VNF instance has been created. The VNF Package used for ""Modify VNF"" has been onboarded in NFVO. .. seqdiag:: seqdiag { Client; NFVO; tacker-server; tacker-conductor; Client -> ""tacker-server"" [label = ""PATCH /vnf_instances/{vnfInstanceId}""]; ""tacker-server"" -> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""execute vnf_package list process{filter}""]; NFVO <- ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""GET /vnf_packages/ with attribute filter(vnfdId)""]; NFVO --> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""Response 200 OK with VnfPkgInfo""]; ""tacker-server"" <<- ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""(VnfPkgInfo)""]; ""tacker-server"" ->> ""tacker-server"" [label = ""Update VNF instance resource(VnfPkgInfo)""]; ""tacker-server"" -> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""execute vnf_package content process{vnfPkgId}""]; NFVO <- ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""GET /vnf_packages/{vnfPkgId}/package_content ""]; NFVO --> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""Response 200 OK with VNF package file""]; ""tacker-server"" <<- ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""(VNF package content file)""]; Client <-- ""tacker-server"" [label = ""Response 202 Accepted""]; ""tacker-server"" -> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""trriger asynchronous task""]; ""tacker-conductor"" ->> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""execute notification process""]; Client <- ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""POST {callback URI} (PROCESSING)""]; Client --> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""Response: 204 No Content""]; ""tacker-conductor"" ->> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""VNF Modification""]; ""tacker-conductor"" ->> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""execute notification process""]; Client <- ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""POST {callback URI} (COMPLETED)""]; Client --> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""Response: 204 No Content""]; } The procedure consists of the following steps as illustrated in above sequence: #. The Client sends a PATCH request to the ""Individual VNF instance"" resource. #. If VNFM does not have target VNF Package, VNFM gets it from NFVO. #. VNFM sends to the Client a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification with the ""PROCESSING"" state to indicate the processing occurrence of the lifecycle management operation. #. The VNFM has finished the modification operation. #. VNFM sends to the Client a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification with the ""COMPLETED"" state to indicate the completion occurrence of the lifecycle management operation. Postcondition: After successful completion, information of the VNF instance is updated. 2) Flow of the Modify VNF Information operation (Other changes) ------------------------------------------------------------------ Precondition: The resource representing the VNF instance has been created. .. seqdiag:: seqdiag { Client -> ""tacker-server"" [label = ""PATCH /vnf_instances/{vnfInstanceId}""]; Client <-- ""tacker-server"" [label = ""Response 202 Accepted""]; ""tacker-server"" -> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""trriger asynchronous task""]; ""tacker-conductor"" ->> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""execute notification process""]; Client <- ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""POST {callback URI} (PROCESSING)""]; Client --> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""Response: 204 No Content""]; ""tacker-conductor"" ->> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""VNF Modification""]; ""tacker-conductor"" ->> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""execute notification process""]; Client <- ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""POST {callback URI} (COMPLETED)""]; Client --> ""tacker-conductor"" [label = ""Response: 204 No Content""]; } #. The Client sends a PATCH request to the ""Individual VNF instance"" resource. #. VNFM sends to the Client a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification with the ""PROCESSING"" state to indicate the processing occurrence of the lifecycle management operation. #. The VNFM has finished the modification operation. #. VNFM sends to the Client a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification with the ""COMPLETED"" state to indicate the completion occurrence of the lifecycle management operation. Postcondition: After successful completion, information of the VNF instance is updated. Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- Modify following tables in current ‘tacker’ database. The corresponding schemas are detailed below:- vnf_instances_metadata: .. code-block:: python id id int(11) Not Null vnf_instance_uuid vnf_instance_uuid varchar(36) Not Null key key varchar(255) Not Null value value varchar(255) Not Null REST API impact --------------- The following restFul API will be added. This restFul API will be based on ETSI NFV SOL002 [#NFV-SOL002]_ and SOL003 [#NFV-SOL003]_. * | **Name**: Modify VNF Instances | **Description**: Modify an Individual VNF instance resource. | **Method type**: PATCH | **URL for the resource**: /vnflcm/v1/vnf_instances/{vnfInstanceId} | **Request**: Resource URI variables for this resource +------------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | Name | Description | +========================+================================================+ | VnfModificationRequest | Identifier of the VNF instance to be modified. | +------------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Request**: .. list-table:: :header-rows: 1 :widths: 18 10 50 * - Data type - Cardinality - Description * - VnfModificationRequest - 1 - Parameters for the Scale VNF operation. .. list-table:: :header-rows: 1 * - Attribute name - Data type - Cardinality - Supported in (V) * - vnfInstanceName - String - 0..1 - Yes * - vnfInstanceDescription - String - 0..1 - Yes * - vnfPkgId - Identifier - 1 - Yes * - vnfdId - Identifier - 1 - Yes * - vnfConfigurableProperties - KeyValuePairs - 0..1 - No * - vimConnectionInfo - VimConnectionInfo - 0..N -> 0..1 - Yes * - metadata - KeyValuePairs - 0..1 - Yes * - extensions - KeyValuePairs - 0..1 - No * - vnfcInfoModifications - VnfcInfoModificartions - 0..1 - No * - vnfcInfoModificationsDeleteIds - Identifier - 0..N - No * - vimConnectionInfoDeleteIds - Identifier - 0..N - No .. note:: vnfPkgId is not available in SOL 002 /003 v2.6.1 but in v2.4.1. However, most NFV related equipment, such as NFVO, still utilize v2.4.1 API and this attribute is mondatory for executing VNF update operation. So, Tacker will support vnfPkgId in Victoria release. Whether or not continue to support v2.4.1 API and attributes for the future release will be decided based on the requirements of service providers and the situation of NFV product. .. note:: vimConnectionInfo shows multiple VIMs per VNF. However due to the partial support of this feature in the ETSI present release, the number of entries in the VIMs attribute is not greater than 1. | **Response**: .. list-table:: :widths: 10 10 20 50 :header-rows: 1 * - Data type - Cardinality - Response Codes - Description * - n/a - n/a - | Success 202 | Error 409 412 - The request was accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- Add new OSC commands in python-tackerclient to invoke VNF update operations of VNF instances API. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- The previously created VNFs will not be allowed to be managed using the newly introduced APIs. Developer impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Keiko Kuriu <keiko.kuriu.wa@hco.ntt.co.jp> Work Items ---------- * Add new REST API endpoints to Tacker-server for VNF update operations of VNF instances. * Make changes in python-tackerclient to add new OSC commands for calling updating operations of VNF instances restFul APIs. * Add new unit and functional tests. * Change API Tacker documentation. Dependencies ============ None Testing ======== Unit and functional test cases will be added for VNF lifecycle management of VNF instances. Documentation Impact ==================== Complete user guide will be added to explain how to invoke VNF lifecycle management of VNF instances with examples. References ========== ..

It was determined that rules from policy files located in the directory
specified in the policy_dirs option (/etc/<config_dir>/policy.d by
default) are not re-applied after the rules from the primary policy file
is re-applied due to a change.

This change introduces additional behavior to make sure the rules from
policy_dirs are reapplied if there is a change to the primary policy
file.

This updates lower constraints to versions that will work with py38 so
that when we move to running on focal nodes, which has py38 as its
default py3 runtime, the lower-constraints job will continue to pass.

It also cleans out some secondary requirements that are no longer needed

This section must contain standard authentication information againt Keystone service in order to query the unified limit APIs. Beware than the account configured require at least a **system_scope** of **reader** for enforcing limits, and authentication information **should not** contains project information, as keystoneauth library will use it instead of system_scope. In addition to the authentication information, oslo_limit configuration section must contains a way to identify the service in order to filter limits by it. It can either be a couple of Keystone **service_name/region_name** or directly a Keystone **endpoint_id**. Here is an example of oslo_limit configuration:: [oslo_limit] auth_url = http://controller:5000 auth_type = password user_domain_id = default username = MY_SERVICE system_scope = reader password = MY_PASSWORD service_name = my_service region_name = RegionOne Create registered limit ----------------------- Before enforcing a limit for a given resource, a registered limit **should** exist for that resource. Registered limit can be, by example, setuped during service deployment. Note that a **system_scope** of **all** is required to create registered limit. Enforce a limit --------------- Using enforcer consist mainly on defining a callback function for processing the current usage of a given project, then calling the enforce function with the amount of each resource you want to consume for a project, catching the exception who can be raised in case of quota exceeding. Here is a simple usage of limit enforcement:: import logging from oslo_limit import limit from oslo_limit import exception as limit_exceptions # Callback function who need to return resource usage for each # resource asked in resources_names, for a given project_id def callback(project_id, resource_names): return {x: get_resource_usage_by_project(x, project_id) for x in resource_names} enforcer = limit.Enforcer(callback) try: # Check a limit for a given project for a set of resources, resource # unit are delta to be consumed enforcer.enforce('project_uuid', {'my_resource': 1}) except limit_exceptions.ProjectOverLimit as e: # What to do in case of limit exception, e contain a list of # resource over quota logging.error(e)",,72,0

Note that this is not our complete backlog for the cycle, we still hope to review and land non-priority items. The primary contact(s) listed are responsible for tracking the status of that work and herding cats to help get that work done. They are not the only contributor(s) to this work, and not necessarily doing most of the coding! They are expected to be available on IRC and the ML for questions, and report status on the whiteboard_ for the weekly IRC sync-up. The number of primary contacts is typically limited to 2-3 individuals to simplify communication. We expect at least one of them to have core privileges to simplify getting changes in. .. _whiteboard: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/IronicWhiteBoard Goals ~~~~~ +---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Priority | Primary Contacts | +=======================================+=====================================+ | `Break the Cycle`_ | Ironic Developers | +---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | kexec | contacts1 | +---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | item????? | contacts1 | +---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | or maybe nuke the list... | contacts2 | +---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | `Bare metal program/SIG`_ | TheJulia, arne_wiebalck | +---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | `Deploy Steps`_ | dtantsur, mgoddard | +---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | `Replacing WSME`_ | dtantsur | +---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | `DHCP-less Deployments`_ | etingof | +---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ Break the Cycle --------------- Ironic as a project which is consumed by other projects and ultimately makes its way into multiple products through these channels. In many ways, it is a swiss-army knife for operators. At the same time it becomes an a semi-hidden implementation detail behind projects like `TripleO <http://tripleo.org>`_ `Metal3 <https://metal3.io>`_, and even in a sense it can be a hidden detail for users of the `OpenStack Compute API <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/configuration/hypervisor-ironic>`_. With this use, and ultimately to support their use cases, we need to do better in terms of trying to release early and often. At the same time, sometimes there is not a reason TO make a brand new release of Ironic or any of its components unless WE NEED to take action to fix it or we have added a new feature. Largely this is because we rely upon stable APIs and interfaces, at least in most cases. At the same time, we do something horrible during the development cycle that we should learn from time after time. We try to do too much. While we would all love to see all of the features, we should be delivering in a model which conforms to `Sem-Ver <http://semver.org>`_ and not force artificial major version changes to match a cycle boundry and to create a branch point. Having said this, it is time for us to move to an independent release model. This has drawbacks, and will require a different approach for planning. And yet not all of ironic's assets should be released in such a way. Some items that fall under our governance as a project have inter-dependencies which ultimately require continuing with the OpenStack release cycle model. Does that make those items any less part of Ironic? Absolutely not! But they are specific integration points, and will always need to be mindful of the need to maintain those integration points. Deploy Steps ------------ While a theme that was included in the Train cycle, the overall effort for deploy steps is ongoing. The Train cycle provided more interfaces capable of being leveraged via deploy steps. The primary goal is to support in-band execution of deploy steps with the focus being on leveraging Software RAID. Bare metal program/SIG ---------------------- The most powerful thing the Ironic community can do this cycle is not actually in code, but in documentation. The recently created `Bare Metal SIG <https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/bare-metal-sig>`_ is working on creation of a white paper as part of the `Bare Metal logo program <https://www.openstack.org/bare-metal/>`_, and needs our help for stand-alone use cases. Replacing WSME -------------- Most long time contributors are aware of the headaches that WSME has brought the community, along with the fact that many projects have migrated away from it. In order to move us to something which is supported by a broader community, the consensus from the Train Project Teams Gathering, was to move ironic towards using Flask. We'll start with re-working a single endpoint and hopefully move through the rest of the API in a rapid fashion. DHCP-less Deployments --------------------- Deployment of machines at the edge requires the case where we do not control DHCP. Except there are cases where there might not be any DHCP server, and in such cases, we must supply networking configuration in the virtual media being attached to the physical machine being deployed.

As we aren't required to re-deploy any more during the converge step
the actions performed by the Upgrade Converge and Prepare are exactly
the same, the only difference is the lifecycle environment file we
use to set and unset parameters.

This patch refactors both classes, the UpgradePrepare and UpgradeConverge
clasess:

- UpgradePrepare: Stop forcing update-plan-only and then try to do most of the
actions from deployment into UpgradePrepare. This change will force config_download
to false (which will avoid running the full deployment and do only an stack update),
then download the config by invoking get_config from utils and lastly enable ssh
into overcloud nodes, as that part is perforemd in deployment only if config_download
is set to true. Add new attributes to UpgradePrepare so we can override them in
UpgradeConverge via inheritence.

- UpgradeConverge: Inherit from UpgradePrepare instead of DeployOvercloud. Set the
right value for the class attributes and let UpgradePrepare class do all the magic.

The core services like Nova and Neutron are then configured to send oslo.messaging notifications to both the region based components(for ex: Searchlight) and at the same time to global components. Currently oslo.messaging only allows to send all the notifications to just one underlying messaging transport(for ex: one rabbitmq cluster which has deployed region based components). This spec proposes to add feature into oslo.messaging which enables operators to define different transport_url for each notification so that they can be sent to the different messaging transport(for ex: rabbitmq clusters) Problem description =================== ``oslo.messaging`` allows to specify the drivers and notifications transports in each components config files like below For example, in nova:: .. code-block:: ini [oslo_messaging_notifications] driver = messaging topics = notifications,notifications_designate transport_url = rabbit://username:password@rabbit001.com:5672 With above configuration the ``notifications`` and ``notifications_designate`` related notifications are sent to the defined ``transport_url`` to ``rabbit001.com``. If the designate service is deployed onto different region/cluster which is using different rabbitmq cluster, currently there is no way to send only the ``notifications_designate`` to say ``rabbit002.com`` which is designate service rabbitmq cluster. Operators should be allowed to send the notifications into different underlying messaging transport based on the ``transport_url per notification``. Proposed change =============== The spec proposes to follow the same implementation of ``enabled_backends`` done Cinder [1]_ and Glance [2]_ components. Define dynamic new config group for each notification ----------------------------------------------------- For example: .. code-block:: ini [oslo_messaging_notifications] driver = messaging topics = notifications,notifications_designate,any_other_notification transport_url = rabbit://username:password@rabbit001.com:5672 [notifications] transport_url = rabbit://username:password@rabbit001.com:5672 [notifications_designate] transport_url = rabbit://username:password@rabbit002.com:5672 As described in the above config section, ``[oslo_messaging_notifications]`` section contains the list of ``topics`` being used for notifications. Each of the notification is then dynamically grouped later and has its own ``transport_url``. * By default if the transport_url is not defined for any of the notification it will fall back to the main sections transport_url ``[oslo_messaging_notifications]`` and if it is defined over there as well then it will finally fallback to the transport_url defined in the ``[oslo_messaging_rabbit]``. In the above example ``notifications`` topic uses ``rabbit001.com`` rabbitmq cluster. ``notifications_designate`` uses ``rabbit002.com`` rabbitmq cluster and ``any_other_notification`` used ``rabbit002.com`` rabbitmq cluster. * The notifications will inherit all the other config option values like ``driver`` etc. * This change is backward compatible so even if operator do not specify each notifications transport_urls they will fall back to the main sections. * This change does not require any changes to oslo.config since everything is already supported. * Also this will not require the clients like Nova, Neutron to change their config files. Alternatives ------------ This use case can be implemented with below new feature: #. Add ``MultiOptGriup`` support in oslo.conf same as ``MultiOpt``. #. Make use of ``MultiOptGroup`` in oslo.messaging and in the clients like Nova and Neutron For example: .. code-block:: ini [oslo_messaging_notifications] driver = messaging topics = notifications transport_url = rabbit://username:password@rabbit001.com:5672 [oslo_messaging_notifications] driver = messaging topics = notifications_designate transport_url = rabbit://username:password@rabbit002.com:5672 [oslo_messaging_notifications] driver = messaging topics = any_other_notification transport_url = rabbit://username:password@rabbit001.com:5672 This solution requires to add a new feature in oslo.config which will allow to define the option group multiple times as shown above which can be used in oslo.messaging to define the transport_urls per notification. This feature might be useful in other use-cases as well where it is required to define the group multiple times. Impact on Existing APIs ----------------------- No impact. Security impact --------------- No impact. Performance Impact ------------------ No impact. Configuration Impact -------------------- Each notification will have its own group which can be defined like above. Developer Impact ---------------- No impact. Testing Impact -------------- Additional unit tests will be required to cover the added functionality. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Dinesh_Bhor (bhordinesh07@gmail.com) Other contributors: volunteers? Milestones ---------- ..TODO(Dinesh_Bhor): figure this out Work Items ---------- * Implement the new dynamic ``notifications`` OptGroup generation. * Integrate it in `get_notifications_transport` and ``Notifier`` class. * Update documentation. * Update the sample configuration generator to include the variable names. * Update the documentation generator to include the variable names. Incubation ========== N/A Documentation Impact ==================== The documentation will need to be updated to indicate that notification option can be overridden with its own dedicated group.

Problem description =================== With python 2 being removed from all of openstack, we need the library backing ``oslo.vmware``'s SOAP calls to be compatible with python 3. We see suds-jurko as being unmaintained `upstream <https://bitbucket.org/jurko/suds/commits/>`_, so we cannot rely on any changes happening. Since we currently already see deprecation warnings generated by nova's tests for python 3.6, we need a fix before the release of python 3.10 or ``oslo.vmware`` will stop working alltogether. Additionally, the vast number of VMs handled by a single compute-node with ``nova``'s VMware driver makes ``suds-jurko`` a performance bottle-neck. This can be overcome with switching to a library more optimized for parsing XML. Proposed change =============== We propose to change the backing library of ``oslo.vmware`` to `zeep <https://python-zeep.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_. The library is * still maintained * written for python 2 and 3 * uses ``lxml`` for faster XML parsing With the interface of zeep being similar but not the same as suds, we have to introduce some compatibility functions. This is also necessary, because some library-specific representation of objects, e.g. attribute access to ``ManagedObjectReference`` objects, leaked through to consuming projects. We therefore propose to change the library and consuming projects in multiple phases. Phase 1: Add compatibility functions to ``oslo.vmware`` for value and type access of ``ManagedObjectReference`` and add additional functions/helpers for attribute access to move all code using suds-specificas into ``oslo.vmware``. Phase 2: Introduce patches to ``cinder`` and ``nova`` for using the functions introduced in phase 1. Phase 3: Switch the code in ``oslo.vmware`` to use ``zeep`` instead of ``suds-jurko`` while keeping the interface for consuming projects the same. The core of these changes should be confined to ``oslo_vmware.service``. Alternatives ------------ There's another fork of ``suds-jurko`` called `suds-community <https://github.com/suds-community/suds>`_, which is still maintained, but while using it may solve the python compatibility problem it doesn't improve performance. While there are other libraries around, see e.g. this list in the `python wiki <https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebServices#SOAP>`_, a quick glance at most of them shows them as unmaintained, not supporting python 3 or having an interface that requires too many compatibility shims for keeping changes in consuming projects minimal. Another alternative would be to get rid of ``oslo.vmware`` alltogether, which is mainly hindered by nova and cinder still including drivers using this library. Impact on Existing APIs ----------------------- Consuming code will be required to use the newly introduced helper-functions for compatibility in attribute access. Security impact --------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ With the XML parser of the library switching to the c-based ``lxml``, we expect a performance increase. In our (very simple) tests, we achieved up to 50 % reduction in request times and CPU load. Configuration Impact -------------------- None Developer Impact ---------------- Consuming code will be required to use the newly introduced helper-functions for compatibility in attribute access. Testing Impact -------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: jkulik Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: unclear Work Items ---------- * Implement helper functions in ``oslo.vmware`` for compatibility layer * Patch ``nova``'s VMware driver to use helper functions * Patch ``cinder``'s VMware driver to use helper functions * Implement ``Service`` object using zeep client in ``oslo.vmware`` Documentation Impact ==================== None Dependencies ============ This adds ``zeep`` into openstack's requirements, while removing ``suds-jurko``.

When the NetApp backend starts, it needs to know whether the
`revert_to_snapshot` support exist. So, it was retrieving the
licenses and checking if the `SnapRestore` is included. Using a
scoped account, the backend cannot retrieve that information,
though. So, this patch solves it by sending a fake operation
`revert_to_snapshot` that must fail. Analyzing the given error, it
sets the backend support field.

When running os-brick in a virtual environment created by a non root
user, we get the following error:

  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'os_brick.privileged.rootwrap'

This happens because the privsep daemon drops all the privileged except
those defined in the context, and our current context doesn't bypass
file read permission checks, so the Daemon cannot read the file with the
code it was asked to run, because it belongs to a different user.

This patch adds the CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability to our privsep
context so we can load the libraries, but only when we are running on a
virtual environment to follow the principle of least privilege.

This bug doesn't affect system-wide installations because the files
installed under /sys/python*/site-packages belong to the Daemon user
(root), so no special capabilities are necessary.

The instance is shut down for a period of time to be moved to another hyper-visor. In this case, the instance recognizes that it was rebooted. **Live migration** (or 'true live migration'). Almost no instance downtime. Useful when the instances must be kept running during the migration. The different types of live migration are: - **Shared storage-based live migration** Both hyper-visors have access to shared storage. - **Block live migration** No shared storage is required. Incompatible with- **Volume-backed live migration** Instances are backed by volumes rather thanPlease refer to the official Openstack documentation on `configuring migrations`_ and `live migration usage`_ for more information. OpenStack Oslo uses an open standard for messaging middleware known as ``AMQP``. This messaging middleware (the RPC messaging system) enables the OpenStack services that run on multiple servers to talk to each other. ``Messaging Timeout: Timed out waiting for a reply to message ID`` ``[message_id]``has to be mounted by shared storage.

Part of the ussuri cycle goals was to drop support for python 2.7. This
removes the package trove classifiers for py2 support and drops testing.

This repo does not use reno, so no release note added.

It also includes the following change necessary to get gate jobs to
pass:

Don't duplicate upstream requirements

This repo assumes neutron and its requirements are installed, with
additional local requirements needed that are specific to the project.
This removes duplicate entries in requirements.txt and
test-requirements.txt to avoid conflicting package requirements.

Also updates lower-constraints to match neutron and/or fix lower
versions that are no longer compatible with our minimum runtimes.

Due to a characteristic on ONTAP devices, the volume extend
operation has a max resize size limited by underlying LUN's
geometry, so the support for extend online volumes was
disabled.

This patch fixes it by allowing a volume (attached or not)
to be extended up to 16TB, which is the max LUN size
supported by ONTAP.

NFS online_extend_support is still disabled due to a bug [0]
found on the generic implementation for NFS driver, which
ONTAP NFS driver relies on.

This is a combination of 3 commits.
This is the 1st commit message:

Temporarily disable grenade-multinode jobs

We need to backport multiple gate fixes, disable the relevant jobs.
Backports should re-enable the matching jobs

This is the commit message #2:

Add ensure-tox in functional job

neutron functional jobs run tests using the tox env.
Even tempest jobs need tox to be present to run the tempest
tests in venv. But functional job derived from devstack-minimal
jobs does not make sure tox is present or not. devstack jobs does not
mak sure that as those are not only used for tox run but also for
other integration testing.

Current neutorn functional job failure-
- https://zuul.opendev.org/t/openstack/build/59865004855c404ab18f06fc0ec1d005

let's call ensure-tox role in job to make sure tox is present.

the gate. We can either change to newer 2.13 tag once released or better
stop compiling OVS and use one packaged by Ubuntu.

Run functional/fullstack tests with selected OVN and OVS versions

Previously for functional tests OVS version was hardcoded - v2.12.0,
and OVN was installed from OVS repository.

After we merged OVN driver to Neutron tree we run both
Neutron/OVS and Neutron/OVN functional tests in one job.

This patch adds possibility to specify from which tag/branch OVS and OVN
should be checkout.

Link local address is a valid address on IPv6 network when we are using
SLAAC instead of DHCPv6, current interface validation bypass link local
address and fails the introspection.
Interfaces without link carrier don't have link local addresses so this
should be fine.

The i18n team has decided not to translate the logs because it seems
like it not very useful; operators prefer to have them in English so
that they can search for those strings on the internet.

Since we have removed log translations completely, we should add hacking
rule to prevent future mistakes.

Due to the way pecan processes exceptions combined with a custom ironic
middleware layer for encoding exceptions we result in a json response
with pecans json response encoded in it. This makes handling ironic's
error messages a nightmare for clients who have to first decode the
outerlayer and then decode the inner json.

This patch moves the exception formatting code to the hooks, which
get executed earlier and receive the non-encoded information.
Then it introduces a new API version, in which the exception information
is no longer JSON encoded. Finally, it makes pecan exceptions look
the same way as WSME exceptions.

OVS tag v2.13.0 is not compatible with current used kernel on upstream
Bionic Ubuntu kernel 4.15.0. This patch sticks to commit hash to unblock
the gate. We can either change to newer 2.13 tag once released or better
stop compiling OVS and use one packaged by Ubuntu.

Run functional/fullstack tests with selected OVN and OVS versions

Previously for functional tests OVS version was hardcoded - v2.12.0,
and OVN was installed from OVS repository.

After we merged OVN driver to Neutron tree we run both
Neutron/OVS and Neutron/OVN functional tests in one job.

This patch adds possibility to specify from which tag/branch OVS and OVN
should be checkout.

If qemu guest agent is not reponsive when setting admin password,
an InternalError will be thrown by nova,
then the VM state will be set to ERROR.

Actually we did nothing to VMs as qga did not answer our request,
such as qga is crashed/halt, etc.
In this kind of senario, libvirt will throw VIR_ERR_AGENT_UNRESPONSIVE
to us by an error code.
We should check the error code return by libvirt and
throw a NotImplementedError, which we've already expected
in compute.manager.
Other cases like qga got our request
but failed to do its work should follow what we used to.

This patch checks the return code from libvirt.
If got VIR_ERR_AGENT_UNRESPONSIVE,
then throws NotImplementedError.

Switch to openstackdocstheme 2.2.1 and reno 3.1.0 versions. Using
these versions will allow especially:
* Linking from HTML to PDF document
* Allow parallel building of documents
* Fix some rendering problems

Update Sphinx version as well.

Set openstackdocs_pdf_link to link to PDF file. Note that
the link to the published document only works on docs.openstack.org
where the PDF file is placed in the top-level html directory. The
site-preview places the PDF in a pdf directory.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

Remove docs requirements from lower-constraints, they are not needed
during install or test but only for docs building.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

Switch to openstackdocstheme 2.2.1 version. Using
this version will allow especially:
* Linking from HTML to PDF document
* Allow parallel building of documents
* Fix some rendering problems

Update Sphinx version as well.

Disable openstackdocs_auto_name to use 'project' variable as name.

Change pygments_style to 'native' since old theme version always used
'native' and the theme now respects the setting and using 'sphinx' can
lead to some strange rendering.

openstackdocstheme renames some variables, so follow the renames
before the next release removes them. A couple of variables are also
not needed anymore, remove them.

For example, it has serveral compute nodes in our cloud env, which are assigned to one segment. We unregularly pull the latest code or change hardware for test. Every time when updating, we have to kill all masakari services after masakari-monitors, so that it wouldn't trigger ha recovery workflow. Once upon a time, we forgot to kill all masakari services when updating. The instances evacuted in a mess, which took us hours to make all instances back to normal. So we need a solution to simply and easily close and open compute ha in specific case, such as update or maintenance. Proposed change =============== This spec is mainly to add 'enable' to segment object. The 'enable' value can be set by segment api.If admin set the 'enable' value to false, then all notifications of the segment will be discarded, and no recovery workflow will be executed.

Since we dropped support for python 2 [1], we no longer need to use the
mock library, which existed to backport py3 functionality into py2.
Which must be done by saying::

    from unittest import mock

...because if you say::

    import mock

...you definitely will not be getting the standard library mock.
That will always import the third party mock library.

This commit adds hacking check N366 to enforce the former.

This check can be removed in the future (and we can start saying
``import mock`` again) if we manage to purge these transitive
dependencies. I'm not holding my breath.

As stated in the bug description, there are many writes of the
agent liveness external_ids into the Chassis table. There was a
protection to avoid bumping nb_cfg too frequently.

The same protection is reused to avoid writing into the Chassis
external_ids.

This patch reduces the number of transactions to the SB database
and, therefore, the recomputations that it causes to ovn-controller
in all nodes.

Disallowing octal value in yaml file primarily impacts the
specification of Linux file permission. Ultimately, forcing yaml
author to perform a decimal conversion. Most Linux users are custom
to the octal (rwx) specification. E.g., chmod 0555 fileName.

This patch set disables the check to avoid contributors from needing

A previous patch[1] missed batch_member_update when adding database
repository ""get"" method retries for new object creation actions.
This patch fixes batch member create to retry the database get call
when new members are being created via batch member update.
This issue only impacts the v1 amphora driver as the v2 driver
does not need to get these objects from the database.

We previously fixed a bunch of places, but not quite *all* the places;
at the very least, some account-layer services (like the replicator and
auditor IIRC) could still bomb out -- and it's important that
replicators still respect fallocate_reserve!

Now, do the NicerInterpolation thing every time we call readconf.
Additionally, clean up the original fix to avoid globally
monkey-patching configparser.

Currently, if the iSCSI CIDR filter filters out some portals in
a synchronous replication setup, it only filters out the portals
but leaves the IQNs and LUNs, which can result in a mismatched
set of connection lists. This addresses the issue by filtering
earlier in the process, and only adding ones that pass the filter
in the first place.
