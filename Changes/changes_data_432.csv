Problem description =================== Multi-cell support was added to the controller services (API, conductor, scheduler) in the Pike release. However, server move operations, like resize, are restricted to the cell in which the instance currently lives. Since it is common for deployments to shard cells by hardware types, and therefore flavors isolated to that hardware, the inability to resize across cells is problematic when a deployment wants to move workloads off the old hardware (flavors) and onto new hardware. Use Cases --------- As a large multi-cell deployment which shards cells by hardware generation, I want to decommission old hardware in older cells and have new and existing servers move to newer cells running newer hardware using newer flavors without users having to destroy and recreate their workloads. Proposed change =============== This is a complicated change, which the proof of concept patch [1]_ shows. As such, I will break down this section into sub-sections to cover the various aspects in what needs to be implemented and why. Keep in mind that at a high level, this is mostly a large data migration from one cell to the next. Why resize? ----------- We are doing resize because cells can be sharded by flavors and resize is the only non-admin way (by default) for users to opt into migrating from one cell with an old flavor (gen1) to a new flavor (gen2) in a new cell. This eases up admins/operators to drain old cells with old hardware. Terms ----- Common terms used throughout the spec. * Source cell: this is the cell in which the instance ""lives"" when the resize is initiated. * Target cell: this is the cell in which the instance moves during a cross-cell resize. * Resized instance: an instance with status ``VERIFY_RESIZE``. Assumptions ----------- * There is no SSH access between compute hosts in different cells. * The image service (glance), persistent volume storage (cinder) and tenant networks (neutron) span cells. Policy rule ----------- A new policy rule ``compute:servers:resize:cross_cell`` will be added. It will default to ``!`` which means no users are allowed. This is both backward compatible and flexible so that operators can determine which users in their cloud are allowed to perform a cross-cell resize. For example, it probably makes sense for operators to allow only system-level admins or test engineers perform a cross-cell resize initially. Resize flow ----------- This describes the flow of a resize up until the point that the server goes to ``VERIFY_RESIZE`` status. * The API will perform its normal checks and call the conductor ``MigrationTask`` which will check if the user is allowed, by the new policy rule, to perform a cross-cell resize. If so, the task will modify the RequestSpec to tell the scheduler to not restrict hosts to the source cell, but the source cell will be ""preferred"". .. note:: A new ``CrossCellWeigher`` will be introduced which will prefer hosts from the source cell. Since a cross-cell resize is more complicated / expensive than a normal resize, we always want to use hosts from the source cell if possible. This weigher will be a noop for all non-cross-cell move operations. * The ``MigrationTask`` will check the selected destinations from the scheduler to see if they are in another cell and if so, call off to a new set of conductor tasks to orchestrate the cross-cell resize. * A new ``CrossCellMigrationTask`` will orchestrate the following sub-tasks: * Verify the selected target host to ensure ports and volumes will work. This validation will include creating port bindings on the target host and ensuring volume attachments can be connected to the host. If either of these fail, the target host will be rejected. At that point, the conductor task will loop through alternate hosts looking for one that works. * Set the ``Migration.cross_cell_move=True`` value and save it. This will be used throughout the rest of the resize and during the confirm/revert flows. * Shelve offload from the source cell. The migration object will be passed to the ``shelve_offload_instance`` method in the compute service to control how the shelve behaves regarding things like removing allocations in placement (we will retain these migration-based allocations on the source host for the revert flow). * The conductor task will poll the status of the instance in the source cell database until the shelve offload operation is complete or a configurable timeout occurs. As a result of a successful offload of an image-backed server, a snapshot image will be available in glance. * Create the instance and its related records (BDMs, VIFs, tags, actions, migrations, etc) in the target cell database. * Update the instance mapping to point at the target cell. We do this before unshelving on the target host in order to properly route neutron networking events. * Unshelve the instance in the target cell. The migration object will be passed to the ``unshelve_instance`` method in the compute service to control how the unshelve behaves regarding things like resource claims, the flavor to use when spawning the instance on the target host, and the terminal ``vm_state`` on the instance (``resized`` rather than ``active``). * The conductor task will poll the status of the instance in the target cell database until it is resized or a configurable timeout occurs. Confirm flow ------------ With a traditional confirm resize operation, the API RPC casts to the source compute to cleanup the source compute. Since we shelve offloaded from the source compute there is nothing to cleanup there. So the confirm work happens in the API for a cross-cell resize. When confirming a resized server, if the ``Migration.cross_cell_move`` value is True, the API will: * Delete the instance and its related records from the source cell database. * Update the ``Migration.status`` to ``confirmed`` (normally the ``confirm_resize`` method on the source compute would do this). * Delete migration-based resource allocations against the source compute node resource provider. * Clear out transition fields from the instance record like old/new flavor. * Ensure the instance goes back to its original state before the resize, either active or stopped. This is mostly important for the case that the user resizes a stopped instance, then starts the guest to verify the resize before confirming it. Revert flow ----------- Similar to the confirm flow, a cross-cell revert resize will be identified via the ``Migration.cross_cell_move`` field in the API. If True, the API will RPC cast to a new conductor method ``revert_cross_cell_resize`` which will execute a new ``CrossCellRevertResizeTask``. That task will: * Shelve offload the instance from the target cell and poll the target cell database until the instance is offloaded or a configurable timeout occurs. .. note:: In this case we do not want the shelve operation to create a new snapshot of an image-backed instance because we will not use it when unshelving in the source cell. The major reason for this is that if we resized the disk up in the target cell, the snapshot image might not fit the disk on the old flavor in the source cell. Also simply because on a revert we do not care about any changes to the guest while it was resized. * Call the scheduler to select a host from the source cell, preferring the original source host if it is still available. If the original source host is no longer available, we will call the scheduler to get any available host that fits the request spec in the source cell. Either way, the allocations held by the migration record against the source host will be removed prior to calling the shceduler since the scheduler will claim those resources again. * Update the instance and its related records in the source cell database based on the contents of the target cell database. This is especially important for things like: * BDMs because you can attach/detach volumes from a resized server. * The ``REVERT_RESIZE`` instance action record created by the API in the target cell. That is needed to track events during the revert in the source cell compute. Thankfully the API does not allow attaching/detaching ports or changing server tags on a resized server so we do not need to copy those back across to the source cell database. * Update the instance mapping to point at the source cell. This needs to happen before unshelving in the source cell so that the ``network-vif-plugged`` event from neutron is routed properly. * Unshelve the instance in the source cell on the selected host. The conductor task will poll the source cell database until the instance is unshelved (back to original active or stopped state) or a configurable timeout occurs. * Update the ``Migration.status`` to ``reverted`` (normally ``revert_resize`` on the destination compute would do this). * Destroy the instance and its related records from the target cell database. Limitations ----------- * Cells v1 will not be supported. * nova-network will not be supported; this mostly pertains to the nova-network specific cell DB tables like ``fixed_ips`` and ``security_groups``. * Targeting a specific host during a cold migration will still be restricted to hosts in the cell in which the instance currently lives. See the `Open questions`_ section for details. * The `_poll_unconfirmed_resizes`_ periodic task, which can be configured to automatically confirm pending resizes on the target host, will not support cross-cell resizes because doing so would require an up-call to the API to confirm the resize and cleanup the source cell database. * The resize/migrate API actions are synchronous until conductor RPC casts to the selected target host. This could be problematic during a cross-cell resize if the conductor needs to validate potential target hosts since the REST API response could timeout. Until the `2.34 microversion`_, the live migrate API had the same problem. As a future enhancement, the resize and cold migrate API actions could similarly be changed to use an RPC cast in a new microversion. * Shelve operations on the compute do not support rescheduling like server create and traditional resize where if something like a resource claim on the target host fails, the compute RPC casts to the cell conductor to reschedule to an alternate host in the same cell. Conductor will try to pre-validate as much about the target host as possible but we will, at least initially, not support reschedules from the compute to conductor during a cross-cell resize. .. _\_poll_unconfirmed_resizes: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/c295e395d/nova/compute/manager.py#L7082 .. _2.34 microversion: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/reference/api-microversion-history.html#id31 Open questions -------------- While the PoC patch demonstrates a working beta of a cross-cell resize, there are several pending open implementation questions which will likely just be sorted out during code review. At a high level, those are: 1. Is a ``MigrationContext`` needed for tracking resources during the resize? Currently, unshelve does a ``ResourceTracker.instance_claim`` which does (a) not consider the new flavor when resizing and (b) does not consider a migration - or populate the ``instance.migration_context`` field. A ``MigrationContext`` is mainly used for two things: a) Routing neutron network-related events, like ``network-vif-plugged``, to the source and target host while the instance is moving. b) Tracking resource claims for NUMA and PCI devices. As such, we could use a ``ResourceTracker.move_claim`` during unshelve in a cross-cell resize which will use the new flavor and create the migration context, but there are downsides to using ``move_claim`` such as it does not change the ``instance.host`` which is something we will need when resizing across cells. Also, we will not require the migration context to route neutron events because during the resize, the instance mapping will be updated to the target cell, so neutron events will go to the target host in the target cell once the instance is unshelved there. This is important because unshelve calls ``driver.spawn()`` which for most compute drivers waits for the ``network-vif-plugged`` callback before proceeding. Since we shelve offload from the source host/cell, we arguably will not need the migration context on the instance since there is no running instance on the source host once we shelve offload from it. For the purposes of this spec, until a ``move_claim`` and ``MigrationContext`` are identified as necessary for a cross-cell resize, they will not be used to try and keep the unshelve code as unchanged as possible. 2. The `2.56 microversion`_ allows users with the admin role to specify a target host during a cold migration. Currently, the API validates that the `target host exists`_ which will only work for hosts in the same cell in which the instance lives (because the request context is targeted to that cell). Should we allow targeting a host for a cold migration that exists in another cell if the request context passes the new policy rule check? And if so, would this require a microversion change for the new behavior even though it is an admin-only API (cold migrate, not resize) by default? For the purposes of this spec, I have opted to leave that for a future enhancement. 3. Rather than polling, would it be better to use an RPC call with a long timeout during the conductor orchestration of the resize? One issue with a long RPC call is if the message queue is interrupted we would lose track of the status of the operation. Also, it could consume an RPC connection from the pool for a long amount of time (while creating a snapshot), which may force operators to increase the ``rpc_conn_pool_size`` configuration value. 4. When reverting a resize, should we even attempt to use the original source host or just ask the scheduler for a fresh host in the source cell? Thanks to `migration allocations`_ the migration record will ""reserve"" the resource allocations on the source host in the source cell so that when we revert, we should be able to swap the allocations back to the instance consumer and unshelve on that host. But if scheduling to that host fails for whatever reason, we should attempt to find another host in the source cell rather than fail the revert. And if we are going to attempt to find an alternative host in the source cell anyway, should we just do that from the beginning of the revert operation? 5. How will ""reschedules"" work between selected target hosts? What if those hosts are all in different cells? Or once we pick a ""primary"" selected host will we require that all alternates are in the same cell? That seems rather limiting but might be a decent initial compromise. 6. Should we disallow attaching/detaching volumes from a resized server during a cross-cell resize? It makes the revert flow more complicated when we have to mirror the changes from the target cell database back into the source cell database. Regardless of cross-cell resize, that might be a bad idea for `detaching the root volume`_ while resized anyway. 7. During revert, should we wait to shelve offload the instance from the target cell until we have successfully unshelved in the source cell in case anything goes wrong? .. _2.56 microversion: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/reference/api-microversion-history.html#id51 .. _target host exists: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/c295e395d/nova/compute/api.py#L3570 .. _migration allocations: https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/queens/implemented/migration-allocations.html .. _detaching the root volume: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/600628/ Alternatives ------------ Users (or cloud operators) could force existing servers to be snapshot, destroyed and then re-created from snapshot with a new flavor in a new cell. This could be highly disruptive to those workloads especially if specific volumes and ports are attached. In addition, it would require all multi-cell deployments to orchestrate their own cross-cell migration tooling. Data model impact ----------------- A ``cross_cell_move`` boolean column, which defaults to False, will be added to the ``migrations`` cell DB table and related versioned object. REST API impact --------------- There will be no explicit request/response schema changes to the REST API. The only major changes from a REST API user perspective will be along the lines of ``OS-EXT-STS:task_state`` transitions, but the end user should really only care about the terminal state of ``VERIFY_RESIZE`` once the resize has completed and then needs to be confirmed/reverted. Normal resize semantics like keeping the instance either ``ACTIVE`` or ``SHUTDOWN`` at the end will remain intact. While the instance is resized and contains records in both cells, the API will have to take care to filter out duplicate instance and migration records while listing those across cells. Security impact --------------- As described in the `Policy rule`_ section, a new policy rule will be added to control which users can perform a cross-cell resize. Notifications impact -------------------- New notifications are not anticipated for this work since we are, for the most part, simply orchestrating a data migration using existing functions. However, obviously the flow of notifications during a resize will be different for a cross-cell resize (as will the related instance action events) since they will include notifications about shelve/unshelve. As long as consumers of resize notifications are clear about the start/end states, they should be OK. If desired, new versioned notifications could be added to denote a cross-cell resize is being performed, either as part of this blueprint or as a future enhancement. Other end user impact --------------------- Notifications, instance action events, and even the server ``OS-EXT-STS:task_state`` transitions will be different compared to a normal resize since a cross-cell resize will include shelve/unshelve operations intermixed with the normal resize events. Consumers should only have to care about the terminal state though which should remain unchanged. Performance Impact ------------------ Clearly a cross-cell resize will perform less well than a normal resize given the database coordination involved and the need to snapshot an image-backed instance out of the source cell and unshelve it in the target cell. Also, deployments which enable this feature may need to scale out their conductor workers which will be doing a lot of the orchestration work rather than inter-compute coordination like a normal resize. Other deployer impact --------------------- Deployers will be able to control who can perform a cross-cell resize in their cloud and also be able to tune parameters used during the resize, like controlling the polling interval and timeout. Two new configuration options will be added. * ``[conductor]/cross_cell_resize_op_poll_interval``: This will be used to control the polling interval in the conductor tasks while waiting for the instance to be shelved/unshelved. The default will be 60 seconds to match the default ``rpc_response_timeout`` value. * ``[conductor]/cross_cell_resize_op_timeout``: This will be used to control the maximum amount of time to wait for a shelve/unshelve operation to complete during a cross-cell resize. The default will be 1800 seconds to match the default ``long_rpc_timeout`` value. Developer impact ---------------- A new ``can_connect_volume`` compute driver interface will be added with the following signature:: def can_connect_volume(self, context, connection_info, instance): That will be used during the validation step to ensure volumes attached to the instance can connect to the destination host in the target cell. The code itself will be relatively minor and just involve parts of an existing volume attach/detach operation for the driver. Upgrade impact -------------- There are three major upgrade considerations to support this feature. * RPC: given the RPC interface changes to the compute and conductor services, those services will naturally need to be upgraded before a cross-cell resize can be performed. * Cinder: because of the validation relying on volume attachments, cinder will need to be running at least Queens level code with the `3.44 microversion`_ available. * Neutron: because of the validation relying on port bindings, neutron will need to be running at least Rocky level code with the ``Port Bindings Extended`` API extension enabled. .. _3.44 microversion: https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/contributor/api_microversion_history.html#id41 Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: Matt Riedemann <mriedem.os@gmail.com> (irc: mriedem) Other contributors: None Work Items ---------- At a high level this is the proposed series of changes that need to be made in order, although realistically some of the control plane changes could be made in any order as long as the cold migrate task change comes at the end. * DB model changes (add ``migrations.cross_cell_move`` column). * Various versioned objects changes for tracking a cross-cell move in the RequestSpec, looking up a Migration by UUID, creating InstanceAction and InstanceActionEvent records from existing data, etc. * Scheduler changes to select destination hosts from multiple cells during a cross-cell move and weighing them so the ""source"" cell is preferred. * nova-compute RPC interface and behavioral changes to make shelve/unshelve flows handle a cross-cell resize operation, any related changes to the ResourceTracker, and adding a validation method on the compute to ensure volumes and ports will work with a target host in another cell. * Adding new conductor tasks for orchestrating a cross-cell resize including reverting a resize. * API plumbing changes to handle confirming/reverting a cross-cell resize. * Add the new policy rule and make the existing cold migration conductor task use it to tell the scheduler whether or not target hosts can come from another cell, and if the target host is from another cell, to run the new cross-cell resize conductor task to orchestrate the resize rather than the traditional compute-orchestrated flow (where the source and target nova-compute services SSH and RPC between each other). Dependencies ============ None Testing ======= The existing functional tests in the PoC change should give a good idea of the types of wrinkles that need to be tested. Several obvious tests include: * Resize both image-backed and volume-backed servers since shelve/unshelve handle those differently. * Ensure allocations in the placement service, and resource reporting from the ``os-hypervisors`` API, are accurate at all points of the resize, i.e. while the server is in ``VERIFY_RESIZE`` status, after it is confirmed and reverted. * Ensure volume attachments and port bindings are managed properly, i.e. no resources are leaked. * Tags, both on the server and associated with virtual devices (volumes and ports) survive across the resize to the target cell. * Volumes attached to a server in ``VERIFY_RESIZE`` status are managed properly in the case of resize confirm/revert. * During a resize, resources which span cells, like the server and its related migration, are not listed with duplicates out of the API. * Perform a resize with at-capacity computes, meaning that when we revert we can only fit the instance with the old flavor back onto the source host in the source cell. * Ensure start/end events/notifications are aligned with a normal same-cell resize. * Resize from both an active and stopped server and assert the original status is retained after confirming and reverting the resize. Unit tests will be added for the various units of changes leading up to the end of the series where the functional tests cover the integrated flows. Negative/error/rollback scenarios will also be covered with unit tests and functional tests as appropriate. Since there are no direct API changes, Tempest testing does not really fit this change. However, something we should really have, and arguably should have had since Pike, is a multi-cell CI job. Details on how a multi-cell CI job can be created though is unclear given the need for it to either integrate with legacy devstack-gate tooling or, if possible, new zuul v3 tooling. Documentation Impact ==================== The compute admin `resize guide`_ will be updated to document cross-cell resize in detail from an operations perspective. The compute `configuration guide`_ will be updated for the new policy rule and configurations added. The compute `server concepts guide`_ may also need to be updated for any user-facing changes to note, like the state transitions of a server during a cross-cell resize. .. _resize guide: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/configuration/resize.html .. _configuration guide: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/configuration/ .. _server concepts guide: https://developer.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/server_concepts.html References ========== ..

rather than using return_value (which does not really do what
the test assumes it does).

Generic driver jobs are failing because of timeouts when
establishing the initial ssh connection from manila-share
to the service VM.

Bump up the default value of the connection timeout for paramiko
client and also set the banner timeout since the failure occurred
during banner exchange.  Set the two timeouts to the same value
for now.  This ensures that the connection timeout is at least as
long as the banner timeout and there is no current need in manila
to control these independently.

This is more of a workaround than a real fix since a real fix

the real fix will need to be in neutron/ovs though.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ====================================== Integrate os_tempest role with TripleO ====================================== Launchpad Blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tripleo/+spec/os-tempest-tripleo Tempest provides a set of API and integrations tests with batteries included in order to validate the OpenStack Deployment. In TripleO project, we are working towards using a unified tempest role i.e. `os_tempest` provided by OpenStack Ansible project in TripleO CI in order to foster collaboration with multiple deployment tools and improve our testing strategies within OpenStack Community. Problem Description =================== In the OpenStack Ecosystem, we have multiple deployment tools to serve different users. In each deployment tools(DevStack, OpenStack-Ansible, Kolla-Ansible, TripleO), uses different Ansible roles to install/Configure/ run tempests and post-processing the tempest results. Each of these roles is trying to do similar stuff tied to the different deployment tools. For example: `validate-tempest` ansible role on TripleO CI provides most of the stuff but it is tied with the TripleO deployment and provides some nice feature [Like: bugcheck, failed tests email notification, stackviz, python-tempestconf support for auto tempest.conf generation ]which are missing in other roles. It is leading to duplication and reduces what tempest tests are not working across them, leading to no collaboration on the Testing side. Since OpenStack Ansible team provides `os_tempest` role for installing/ configuring/running tempest and post tempest results processing. It almost provides most of the stuff provided by each of the deployment tool specific tempest roles. There are few stuffs which are missing can be added in the role and make it useable so that other deployment tools can consume it. Proposed Change =============== Using unified `os_tempest` ansible role in TripleO CI will help to maintain one less role within TripleO project and help us to collaborate with openstack-ansible team in order to share/improve tests strategies across OpenStack ecosystem and solve tempest issues fastly. In order to achieve that, we need: * Improve `os_tempest` role to add support for package/container install, python-tempestconf, stackviz, skip list, bugcheck, tempest log collection at the proper place. * Have a working CI job on standalone running tempest from `os_tempest` role as well as on OSA side. * Provide an easy migration path from validate-tempest role. Alternatives ----------- If we do not use the existing `os_tempest` role then we need to re-write the `validate-tempest` role which will result in again duplication and it will cost too much time and it also requires another set of efforts for adoption in the community which does not seems to feasible. Security Impact --------------- None Upgrade Impact -------------- None Other End User Impact --------------------- We need to educate users for migrating to `os_tempest`. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- None Developer Impact ---------------- Helps more collaboration and improves testing. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: * Arx Cruz (arxcruz) * Chandan Kumar (chkumar246) * Martin Kopec (mkopec) Work Items ---------- * Install tempest and it's dependencies from Distro packages * Running tempest from containers * Enable stackviz * python-tempestconf support * skiplist management * Keeping all tempest related files at one place * Bugcheck * Standalone based TripleO CI job consuming os_tempest role * Migration path from validate-tempest to os_tempest role * Documentation update on How to use it * RDO packaging Dependencies ============ Currently, os_tempest role depends on `python_venv_build` role when tempest is installed from source (git, pip, venv). We need to package it in RDO. Testing ======= The unified tempest role `os_tempest` will replace validate-tempest role with much more improvements. Documentation Impact ==================== Documentation on how to consume `os_tempest` needs to be updated.

networking-ansible ML2 driver invokes ansible via an ASL 2.0 python
wrapper named ansible-runner.

Is the library actively maintained?
Yes - https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner
I've been working with the maintainers and they've been very responsive

Is the library good code?
Yes - Documentation has been good and contributing has been easy
stability has been good and good coding practices appear to be
practiced.

Is the library python 3 compatible?
Yes
https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/commit/b86c50978e70526e952a1a19bc94997f99b98992

Is the library license compatible?
Yes - ASL 2.0

Is the library already packaged in the distros we target (Ubuntu latest / Fedora latest)?
Fedora - Yes
Ubuntu - No

Is the function of this library already covered by other libraries in global-requirements.txt?
I don't believe so. Afaik it's the only distibuted lib that provides a
programatic interface to ansible.

Is the library required for OpenStack project or related dev or infrastructure setup? (Answer to this should be Yes, of course) Which?
Yes - networking-ansible invokes it directly to manage switching
infrastructure via Ansible Networking

Reason for this backport:
We want to support networking-ansible in the Queens release. ansible-runner
is used only by networking-ansible so we won't affect other projects with
this patch. With ansible-runner not being present in Queens we won't be
able to make networking-ansible working in the Queens release.

pexpect library also had to be bumped because ansible-runner has a
requirement on it given as >= 4.5

Is there a race condition on the wait method, a greenthread A is blocked
on the wait, but another greenthread B calls clear() and
then set(), B calls self._event.send(), but A is waiting on a different
eventlet Event which is no longer used by the oslo.service Event...

Also the threading.Event object allows calling set() multiple times, but
the eventlet.Event object only permits send() to be called once,
before a reset() is required to reuse the Event.

Calling eventletutils.Event.set() multiple times triggers an
AssertionError from eventlet.Event. This change resets the underlying eventlet.Event
if the set() method had already been called previously, and ensures the eventletutils.Event
behaves the same as the threading.Event.

This does not do anything about replicator or other daemons,
only ports the server.

- wsgi_to_bytes(something.get('X-Foo')) assumes that None is possible
- Dunno if del-in-for-in-dict calls for clone or list(), using list()
- Fixed the zero-copy with EventletPlungerString(bytes)

Curiously enough, the sleep(0) before checking for logging was
already present in the tests. The py3 scheduling merely forces us
to do it consistently throughout.

The unit test
test_enable_dhcp_helper_enable_metadata_nonisolated_dist_network
modifies the global variables fake_port1, fake_port2, creating flakiness
on unit tests that use those variables when execured in environments
with high concurrency.

Creating a deepcopy of the variable avoid that those changes can be
propagated to other unit tests.

get_hub function was added in commit b155da42 with the idea to bypass
eventlet automatic hub selection that prefers epoll if available by default.

Since version 0.20.0 eventlet removed select.poll() function in its patched
select module (eventlet.green.select), see:
   - https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/commit/614a20462

So if eventlet monkey patching is done before a get_hub() call (as now in
wsgi.py since commit c9410c7d) if we use 'import select' we get the eventlet
version that don't have poll attribute.

To prevent that we use eventlet.patcher.original function to get python select
module to test if poll() is available on current platform.

The unit test
test_enable_dhcp_helper_enable_metadata_nonisolated_dist_network
modifies the global variables fake_port1, fake_port2, creating flakiness
on unit tests that use those variables when execured in environments
with high concurrency.

Creating a deepcopy of the variable avoid that those changes can be
propagated to other unit tests.

This patch adds the option to split retrieved volumes and snapshots
by chunks during Volume Manager host initialization. Query results
will be obtained in batches from the database and not in one shot
to avoid extreme memory usage. Max number of volumes and snapshots
per batch is controlled by option init_host_max_objects_retrieval.
Option is disabled by default for backward compatibility.

To migrate any ConfKeyManager keys based on fixed_key to the currently
configured key manager Volume Manager will use special lightweight
object - VolumeMigration.

Previously this was not done, which meant all arguments were
assumed to be ints. As long as we didn't get any large pointer
addresses this worked fine, but for some reason the addition of
threading to oslo.privsep triggered larger addresses that were then
truncated. This caused segfaults in the underlying C library because

The unit test
test_enable_dhcp_helper_enable_metadata_nonisolated_dist_network
modifies the global variables fake_port1, fake_port2, creating flakiness
on unit tests that use those variables when execured in environments
with high concurrency.

Creating a deepcopy of the variable avoid that those changes can be
propagated to other unit tests.

The installation of the nova-consoleauth service was erroneously
removed from the docs prematurely. The nova-consoleauth service
is still being used in Rocky, with the removal being possible in
Stein.

This should have been fixed as part of change
Ibbdc7c50c312da2acc59dfe64de95a519f87f123 but was missed.

This is also related to the release note update in Rocky
under change Ie637b4871df8b870193b5bc07eece15c03860c06.

The thread that is created in the 'network_adapter' is never released,
we should use task_manager.stop() to release unnecessary resources.

This is a follow-up patch of https://review.openstack.org/#/c/627741/

Create RBAC policy form:
* Merge ""Action"" and ""Object Type"" choices into a single drop-down menu.
  There is a constraint between an object type and an action and
  ""access_as_external"" is not a valid action for ""qos_policy"" object type.
  It sounds reasonable to merge ""action"" and ""object type"" into a single
  list to avoid confusion.
* Add ""Select a Network"" and ""Select a QoS policy"" to the choices of
  a target network and a target QoS policy.

Edit RBAC policy form:
* Add ""*"" (all projects) to ""Target Project"".

This commit adds playbooks and roles to the ops tooling setup to
build, deploy, and operate environments with skydive within in
it.

Skydive is a network analyzer which will allow users to explore
their topology in real-time using a defined storage back-end for
captures, alerts, and more.

The initial implementation of skydive deploys agents throughout
the environment and wires them all back to a cluster of analyzers
which leverage elasticsearch for its persistent storage back-end.
Storage back-ends are load balanced from the within the analyzer
nodes using the traefik light-weight reverse proxy. This setup
gives skydive a fully fault tolerant deployment.

Tests have been added to ensure the binary installation process
is validated. While these jobs are non-voting today, they'll be
iterated on and made passing in the subsequent PRs. All jobs are
following the selective pattern which allows these tools to be
gated in the mono-repo without impacting all other tools within
the environment.

get_location defines the type of its ``group`` parameter as a str,
but it then passes that directly into _do_get, which expects an
OptGroup for its parameter. When it tries to reference group.name
it blows up because a str doesn't have a .name attr.

The variable {{ node_config_directory }} is used for the configuration
directory on the remote hosts, and should not be used for paths on the
deploy host (localhost).

This changes the default value of the TLS certificate and CA file to
reference {{ CONFIG_DIR }}, in line with the directory used for
admin-openrc.sh (as of I0709482ead4b7a67e82796e17f85bde151e71bc0).

This change also introduces a variable, {{ node_config }}, that
references {{ CONFIG_DIR | default('/etc/kolla') }}, to remove
duplication.

When creating a new election we need to add a directory per project
(including the 'TC' as a pseudo project) we can't just create an empty
directory in git so we add a '.placeholder' file.

We have recently added a voting job that will run try to validate all
candidate files added in a review.  This includes the placeholder file.
CLearly this file will not pass validation and cause the job to fail.

Adding .placeholder to the zuul irrelevant-files variable wont work, so

pylint 2.2.x is supported only in Python 3 and we already switched

In particular pay attention to services or configuration parameters that have retired, deprecated or changed. Wherever possible, the latest version of a charm has code to handle almost all changes such that the resultant system should be configured in the same way. However, removed, added or replaced services **will** require manual intervention. When charms *can't* perform a change, either due to a bug in the charm (i.e. a system configuration that the charms haven't been programmed to handle) or because *at the individual charm level* the charm can't change the service (i.e. when a service is replaced with another service, a *different* charm would be needed). However, the following list is known issues that an operator may encounter that the charm does not automatically take care of, along with mitigation strategies to resolve the situation. neutron-gateway charm: upgrading from Mikata to Newton ------------------------------------------------------ Reference Bug `#1809190: switching from external-network-id and external-port to data-port and bridge-mappings does not remove incorrect nics from bridges <https://bugs.launchpad.net/charm-neutron-gateway/+bug/1809190>`_ Between the mitaka and newton OpenStack releases, the ``neutron-gateway`` charm add two options, ``bridge-mappings`` and ``data-port``, which replaced the (now) deprecated ``ext-port`` option. This was to provide more control over how ``neutron-gateway`` can configure external networking. The charm was designed so that it would work with either ``data-port`` (no longer recommended) *or* ``bridge-mappings`` and ``data-port``. Unfortunately, when upgrading from OpenStack Mitaka to Newton the referenced bug above was been encountered, and therefore may require manual intervention to resolve the issue.",,41,0

py35 and py36.

We make remote network hits to get the GPG keys which are quite
unreliable, and apt_key does not support using a proxy properly [1]
so let's store them inside the role and use them.

The implementation here matches that which was done in the
galera_client role in I520ccbadf3320b0d07fc83e3dbec9ea2bd16ec83

This is a re-implementation rather than a backport - the Stein
(aka master) branch only uses the 'distro' install method, so
this code path is not exercised.

Also note that the Erlang yum gpg key and the rabbitmq yum gpg key
are the same, and the Erlang key was never imported - so we've
removed it.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ========================================== Add project_id attribute to group response ========================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/add-project-id-to-group-response This blueprint proposes to add ``project_id`` attribute to the response body of list groups with detail and show group detail APIs. Problem Description =================== Currently, the group show response doesn't include project_id. It is an important parameter while differentiating between multiple groups in horizon. Use Cases ========= As horizon is adding a tab for group listing with detail in the admin panel[1], it requires project_id as a response parameter from the groups API. It is similar to what is implemented in volumes and snapshots list. Proposed change =============== This spec proposes to add ``project_id`` attribute to the response body of list groups with detail and show group detail APIs. Add a new microverion API to add ``project_id`` attribute to the response body of list groups with detail and show group detail APIs: - List groups with detail GET /v3/{project_id}/groups/detail - Show group detail GET /v3/{project_id}/groups/{group_id} Alternatives ------------ None REST API impact --------------- Add a new microversion in Cinder API. * List groups with detail:: GET /v3/{project_id}/groups/detail Response BODY: { ""groups"": [{ ... ""project_id"": ""7ccf4863071f44aeb8f141f65780c51b"" }] } * Show group detail:: GET /v3/{project_id}/groups/{group_id} Response BODY: { ""groups"": [{ ... ""project_id"": ""7ccf4863071f44aeb8f141f65780c51b"" }] } Calling this method shows ``project_id`` for a group. It is intended for admins to use, which is used to display the project_id to which the group belongs, and controlled by ``GROUP_ATTRIBUTES_POLICY``.

Prometheus gathers metrics by scraping defined service endpoints or pods at specified intervals and indexing them in the underlying time series database. Prometheus Service configuration -------------------------------- The Prometheus service is configured via command line flags set during runtime. These flags include: setting the configuration file, setting log levels, setting characteristics of the time series database, and enabling the web admin API for snapshot support. These settings can be configured via the values tree at: :: conf: prometheus: storage: log: query: web_admin_api: The Prometheus configuration file contains the definitions for scrape targets and the location of the rules files for triggering alerts on scraped metrics. The configuration file is defined in the values file, and can be found at: :: conf: prometheus: scrape_configs: | By defining the configuration via the values file, an operator can override all configuration components of the Prometheus deployment at runtime. Kubernetes Endpoint Configuration --------------------------------- The Prometheus chart in openstack-helm-infra uses the built-in service discovery mechanisms for Kubernetes endpoints and pods to automatically configure scrape targets. Functions added to helm-toolkit allows configuration of these targets via annotations that can be applied to any service or pod that exposes metrics for Prometheus, whether a service for an application-specific exporter or an application that provides a metrics endpoint via its service. The values in these functions correspond to entries in the monitoring tree under the prometheus key in a chart's values.yaml file. The functions definitions are below: :: {{- define ""helm-toolkit.snippets.prometheus_service_annotations"" -}} {{- $config := index . 0 -}} {{- if $config.scrape }} prometheus.io/scrape: {{ $config.scrape | quote }} {{- end }} {{- if $config.scheme }} prometheus.io/scheme: {{ $config.scheme | quote }} {{- end }} {{- if $config.path }} prometheus.io/path: {{ $config.path | quote }} {{- end }} {{- if $config.port }} prometheus.io/port: {{ $config.port | quote }} {{- end }} {{- end -}} :: {{- define ""helm-toolkit.snippets.prometheus_pod_annotations"" -}} {{- $config := index . 0 -}} {{- if $config.scrape }} prometheus.io/scrape: {{ $config.scrape | quote }} {{- end }} {{- if $config.path }} prometheus.io/path: {{ $config.path | quote }} {{- end }} {{- if $config.port }} prometheus.io/port: {{ $config.port | quote }} {{- end }} {{- end -}} These functions render the following annotations: - prometheus.io/scrape: Must be set to true for Prometheus to scrape target - prometheus.io/scheme: Overrides scheme used to scrape target if not http - prometheus.io/path: Overrides path used to scrape target metrics if not /metrics - prometheus.io/port: Overrides port to scrape metrics on if not service's default port Each chart that can be targeted for monitoring by Prometheus has a prometheus section under a monitoring tree in the chart's values.yaml, and Prometheus monitoring is disabled by default for those services. Example values for the required entries can be found in the following monitoring configuration for the prometheus-kube-state-metrics chart: :: monitoring: prometheus: enabled: false node_exporter: scrape: true If the prometheus.enabled key is set to true, the annotations are set on the targeted service or pod as the condition for applying the annotations evaluates to true. For example: :: {{- $prometheus_annotations := $envAll.Values.monitoring.prometheus.node_exporter }} --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: {{ tuple ""node_metrics"" ""internal"" . | include ""helm-toolkit.endpoints.hostname_short_endpoint_lookup"" }} labels: {{ tuple $envAll ""node_exporter"" ""metrics"" | include ""helm-toolkit.snippets.kubernetes_metadata_labels"" | indent 4 }} annotations: {{- if .Values.monitoring.prometheus.enabled }} {{ tuple $prometheus_annotations | include ""helm-toolkit.snippets.prometheus_service_annotations"" | indent 4 }} {{- end }} Kubelet, API Server, and cAdvisor --------------------------------- The Prometheus chart includes scrape target configurations for the kubelet, the Kubernetes API servers, and cAdvisor. These targets are configured based on a kubeadm deployed Kubernetes cluster, as OpenStack-Helm uses kubeadm to deploy Kubernetes in the gates. These configurations may need to change based on your chosen method of deployment. Please note the cAdvisor metrics will not be captured if the kubelet was started with the following flag: :: --cadvisor-port=0 To enable the gathering of the kubelet's custom metrics, the following flag must be set: :: --enable-custom-metrics Rules Configuration ------------------- Prometheus provides a querying language that can operate on defined rules which allow for the generation of alerts on specific metrics. The Prometheus chart in openstack-helm-infra defines these rules via the values.yaml file. By defining these in the values file, it allows operators flexibility to provide specific rules via overrides at installation. The following rules keys are provided: :: values: conf: rules: alertmanager: etcd3: kube_apiserver: kube_controller_manager: kubelet: kubernetes: rabbitmq: mysql: ceph: openstack: custom: These provided keys provide recording and alert rules for all infrastructure components of an OpenStack-Helm deployment. If you wish to exclude rules for a component, leave the tree empty in an overrides file. Any custom rules that do not fall within these keys can be inserted into the custom tree. To read more about Prometheus recording and alert rules definitions, please see the official Prometheus recording_ and alert_ rules documentation. .. _recording: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/ .. _alert: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/ Note: Prometheus releases prior to 2.0 used gotpl to define rules. Prometheus 2.0 changed the rules format to YAML, making them much easier to read. The Prometheus chart in openstack-helm-infra uses Prometheus 2.0 by default to take advantage of changes to the underlying storage layer and the handling of stale data. The chart will not support overrides for Prometheus versions below 2.0, as the command line flags for the service changed between versions. Installation ------------ The Prometheus chart can be installed with the following command: .. code-block:: bash helm install --namespace=openstack local/prometheus --name=prometheus The above command results in a Prometheus deployment configured to automatically discover services with the necessary annotations for scraping, configured to gather metrics on the kubelet, the Kubernetes API servers, and cAdvisor. Extending Prometheus -------------------- Prometheus can target various exporters to gather metrics related to specific applications to extend visibility into an OpenStack-Helm deployment. Currently, openstack-helm-infra contains charts for: - prometheus-kube-state-metrics: Provides additional Kubernetes metrics - prometheus-node-exporter: Provides metrics for nodes and linux kernels - prometheus-openstack-metrics-exporter: Provides metrics for OpenStack services Kube-State-Metrics ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The prometheus-kube-state-metrics chart provides metrics for Kubernetes objects as well as metrics for kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager. Information on the specific metrics available via the kube-state-metrics service can be found in the kube-state-metrics_ documentation. The prometheus-kube-state-metrics chart can be installed with the following: .. code-block:: bash helm install --namespace=kube-system local/prometheus-kube-state-metrics --name=prometheus-kube-state-metrics .. _kube-state-metrics: https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/tree/master/Documentation Node Exporter ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The prometheus-node-exporter chart provides hardware and operating system metrics exposed via Linux kernels. Information on the specific metrics available via the Node exporter can be found on the Node_exporter_ GitHub page. The prometheus-node-exporter chart can be installed with the following: .. code-block:: bash helm install --namespace=kube-system local/prometheus-node-exporter --name=prometheus-node-exporter .. _Node_exporter: https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter OpenStack Exporter ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The prometheus-openstack-exporter chart provides metrics specific to the OpenStack services. The exporter's source code can be found here_. While the metrics provided are by no means comprehensive, they will be expanded upon. Please note the OpenStack exporter requires the creation of a Keystone user to successfully gather metrics. To create the required user, the chart uses the same keystone user management job the OpenStack service charts use. The prometheus-openstack-exporter chart can be installed with the following: .. code-block:: bash helm install --namespace=openstack local/prometheus-openstack-exporter --name=prometheus-openstack-exporter .. _here: https://github.com/att-comdev/openstack-metrics-collector Other exporters ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Certain charts in OpenStack-Helm include templates for application-specific Prometheus exporters, which keeps the monitoring of those services tightly coupled to the chart. The templates for these exporters can be found in the monitoring subdirectory in the chart. These exporters are disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting the appropriate flag in the monitoring.prometheus key of the chart's values.yaml file. The charts containing exporters include: - Elasticsearch_ - RabbitMQ_ - MariaDB_ .. _Elasticsearch: https://github.com/justwatchcom/elasticsearch_exporter .. _RabbitMQ: https://github.com/kbudde/rabbitmq_exporter .. _MariaDB: https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter Ceph ~~~~ Starting with Luminous, Ceph can export metrics with ceph-mgr prometheus module. This module can be enabled in Ceph's values.yaml under the ceph_mgr_enabled_plugins key by appending prometheus to the list of enabled modules. After enabling the prometheus module, metrics can be scraped on the ceph-mgr service endpoint. This relies on the Prometheus annotations attached to the ceph-mgr service template, and these annotations can be modified in the endpoints section of Ceph's values.yaml file. Information on the specific metrics available via the prometheus module can be found in the Ceph prometheus_ module documentation. .. _prometheus: http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/mgr/prometheus/ Prometheus Dashboard -------------------- Prometheus includes a dashboard that can be accessed via the accessible Prometheus endpoint (NodePort or otherwise). This dashboard will give you a view of your scrape targets' state, the configuration values for Prometheus's scrape jobs and command line flags, a view of any alerts triggered based on the defined rules, and a means for using PromQL to query scraped metrics. The Prometheus dashboard is a useful tool for verifying Prometheus is configured appropriately and to verify the status of any services targeted for scraping via the Prometheus service discovery annotations.

When upgrading from MySQL 10.1 to 10.3 a bug appears if no

Make sure we always stop the MySQL server cleanly before
upgrading to a new version, to avoid redo log issue.

Note: to be idempotent, we need to stop the mysql container
rather than delete it; to be able to stop the container, we
amend the restart policy of the mysql container.

This patch proposes to use the trash functionality in Ceph RBD to
support deferred deletion in the RBD volume driver. With deferred
deletion enabled, deleting a volume will only move it to the trash.
A periodic task is checking if the deferment time of volumes in the
trash has expired and (if it has) remove them from the backend.
The patch also adds config options to enable the feature, to set the
trash deferment time, and to define the interval at which the periodic
purge task is triggered.

There is a circular dependency between os-service-types and
keystoneauth, where keystoneauth uses os-service-types as a run time
dependency but os-service-types uses keystoneauth in its unit tests.
When these packages are bootstrapped for new branches, neither will
build because of this circular dependency. This patch removes
os-service-types's build dependency on keystoneauth by skipping the test
file that imports keystoneauth.

The files and templates we carry are almost always in a state of
maintenance. The upstream services are maintaining these files and
there's really no reason we need to carry duplicate copies of them. This
change removes all of the files we expect to get from the upstream
service. while the focus of this change is to remove configuration file
maintenance burdens it also allows the role to execute faster.

  * Source installs have the configuration files within the venv at
    ""<<VENV_PATH>>/etc/<<SERVICE_NAME>>"". The role will now link the
    default configuration path to this directory. When the service is
    upgraded the link will move to the new venv path.
  * Distro installs package all of the required configuration files.

To maintain our current capabilities to override configuration the
role will fetch files from the disk whenever an override is provided and
then push the fetched file back to the target using `config_template`.
