This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================== Support Cinder Volume Multi-attach ================================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/multi-attach-volume Currently, Nova only allows a volume to be attached to a single host or instance. There are times when a user may want to be able to attach the same volume to multiple instances. Problem description =================== Currently, Nova only allows a volume to be attached to one instance and or host at a time. Nova makes an assumption in a number of places that assumes the limitation of a single volume to a single instance regardless of the fact that Cinder now supports attaching and detaching a volume to/from multiple instances. Nova assumes that if a volume is attached, it can't be attached again, see nova/volume/cinder.py: check_attach() for details. Use Cases --------- Allow users to share volumes between multiple guests using either read-write or read-only attachments. Clustered applications with two nodes where one is active and one is passive. Both require access to the same volume although only one accesses actively. When the active one goes down, the passive one can take over quickly and has access to the data. Proposed change =============== The changes needed in Nova are related to attach time and detach time. At attach time, Nova has to remove the assumption that it can only attach a volume if it's not 'in-use'. A Cinder volume can now be attached if it's 'available' and/or 'in-use'. Cinder will only allow a volume to be attached more than once if it's 'multiattach' flag is set on the volume at create time. At detach time, Nova needs to pass the attachment_id to the cinderclient to tell cinder which specific attachment it's requesting to detach. Since a volume can be attached to an instance and/or a host, we cannot skip to pass the attachment_uuid at detach time. Passing only an instance uuid is insufficient as cinder provides the possibility to attach a volume to a host. If it isn't passed in and there are multiple attachments, then cinder will fail because it won't know which attachment to detach. On Nova side the attachment_id can be identified by getting the volume attachments from the volume_api and search for the attachment by using the instance_uuid, it does not have to be stored in Nova. By default libvirt assumes all disks are exclusively used for a single guest. If you want to share disks between instances, you need to tell libvirt when configuring the guest XML for that disk via setting the sharable flag for the disk. This means that the hypervisor will not try to take an exclusive lock on the disk, that all I/O caching is disabled, and any SELinux labeling allows use by all domains. Nova needs to set this sharable flag for the multi-attach disks of the instances. Only the libvirt driver is modified to support multi-attach, for all other virt drivers this capability is disabled, the information is stored among the virt driver capabilities dict in the base ComputeDriver. Alternatives ------------ For the use case described above the failover scenario can be handled by attaching the volume to the passive/standby instance. This means that the standby instance is not a hot standby anymore as the volume attachment requires time, which means that the new primary instance is without volume for the time of re-attaching, which can vary in the sense of marking the volume free after the failure of the primary instance. Another alternative is to clone a volume and attach the clone to the second instance. The downside to this is any changes to the original volume don't show up in the mounted clone so this is only a viable alternative if the volume is read-only. Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- There are features of the Nova API that has to be handled by care or disabled completely for now for volumes that support multi-attach. In this sense 'create_volume_snapshot' is disabled as we cannot identify the BDM without the instance_uuid. The API format for this request is not changed, it is only a protection until the required API changes to support this request with multi-attach. Another feature that needs limitations is the 'boot from volume' (BFV). In case of this feature two aspects need further investigation. The first is the 'delete_on_termination' flag, which if set to True is intended to remove the volume that is attached to the instance when it is deleted. This option does not cause problem as Cinder takes care of not deleting a volume if it still has active attachments. Nova will receive an error from Cinder that the volume deletion failed, which will then be logged [#]_, but will not affect the instance termination process. According to this this flag will be allowed to use along with multi-attach, no changes are necessary when the volume provided has multiattach=True and the delete_on_termination=True flag is passed in for BFV. The second aspect of BFV is the boot process. In this case the only issue comes with the bootable volumes, which are specified in the boot request as boot device. For this the 'block_device_mapping' list has to be checked to filter out the cases when we have a multiattachable volume specified as boot device. It can be done by checking the 'source_type' and 'destination_type' of a BDM and also search for 'boot_index': 0 item in the BDM dict. Based on the volume_id stored within the BDM information the volume can be retrieved from Cinder to check whether the 'multiattach' flag is set to True in which case the request will return an error that this operation is not supported for multi-attach volumes. For cases, where Nova creates the volume itself, i.e. source_type is blank/image/snapshot, it should not enable multi-attach for the volume for now. More desired REST API changes are listed in a follow up spec. Security impact --------------- In the libvirt driver, the disk is given a shared SELinux label, and so that disk has no longer strong sVirt SELinux isolation. The OpenStack volume encryption capability is supposed to work out of the box with this use case also, it should not break how the encryptor works below the clustered file system, by using the same key for all connections. The attachment of an encrypted volume to multiple instances should be tested in Tempest to see if there is any unexpected issue with it. Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- The command line will now allow you to call Nova volume-attach for a volume to multiple instances. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- None Developer impact ---------------- Any time new code is added to Nova that requires a call to detach a volume, the developer must get the volume attachment uuid for the instance. This information is embedded in the cinder volume volume_attachments list. Implementation ============== Based on the work from Walter Boring and Charlie Zhou. Agreed with Walter to start the work again. Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ildiko-vancsa Work Items ---------- 1. Update the use of cinderclient to extract the new list of volume attachments when Nova fetches a volume. 2. Update all calls to cinderclient.detach() to include the attachment uuid. 3. Update libvirt driver to generate proper domain XML for instances with multi-attach volumes Dependencies ============ * This requires the version 1.3.1 or above of the python-cinderclient. Corresponding blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/python-cinderclient/+spec/multi-attach-volume * Corresponding, implemented spec in Cinder: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/multi-attach-volume * Link needed to Cinder spec to address detach issues currently captured here: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/cinder-nova-api-changes Testing ======= We'll have to add new Tempest tests to support the new Cinder volume multiattach flag. The new cinder multiattach flag is what allows a volume to be attached more than once. For instance the following scenarios will need to be tested: * Attach the same volume to two instances. * Boot from volume with multiattach * Encrypted volume with multiattach * Negative testing: * Boot from multi-attachable volume with boot_index=0 * Tying to attach a non-multiattach volume to multiple instances Documentation Impact ==================== We will have to update the documentations to discuss the new ability to attach a volume to multiple instances if the cinder multiattach flag is set on a volume. It is also need to be added to the documentation that the volume creation for these types of volumes will not be supported by the API due to the deprecation of the volume creation Nova API. If a volume needs to allow multiple volume attachments it has to be created on the Cinder side with the needed properties specified. It also needs to be outlined in the documentation that attaching a volume multiple times in read-write mode can cause data corruption, if not handled correctly. It is the users' responsibility to add some type of exclusion (at the file system or network file system layer) to prevent multiple writers from corrupting the data. Examples should be provided if available to guide users on how to do this.

Manila HNAS driver splits the path to manage a share by ':', so when

This patch addresses the following issues in OpenID Connect federated
authentication and enables WebSSO as well as non-WebSSO authentication flows.

- WSGIScriptAliasMatch has been removed because default puppet-keystone
  defines a ScriptAlias for the root, effectively creating a redundant
  configuration.

- Added a new parameter `openidc_response_type` to the `openidc` class which
  allows you to select the provider response type.  This is useful for when
  providers don't support default `id_token`.

- Removed `openidc_redirect_uri` from the `openidc_httpd_configuration` class
  in order to be able to build the entire URL in the template for both WebSSO
  and non-WebSSO OpenID connect flows

With this patch, users have the ability to get a fully configured WebSSO setup
out of the box.

Right now devstack sets DEFAULT_IMAGE_NAME depending on the driver in
stackrc. UUID of the image with this name is then written to tempest
config during tempest configuration stage and is used to determine
which image will be used during nova boot.

As ironic python agent now supports both whole disk and partition
images, we should change this logic, and the user should be able to
request which image should be used in tests.

This commit adds IRONIC_TEMPEST_WHOLE_DISK_IMAGE and
IRONIC_IMAGE_NAME variables to provide this possibility.

If IRONIC_TEMPEST_WHOLE_DISK_IMAGE is not set, we try to infer the
image type by the size of the ephemeral partition requested, if it
is 0, we consider the image to be whole disk.

Originally, 'Displaying x items' is included in footer area.
However, the element that the previous patch added is not in this area.
Thus, when the number of rows in table is zero, this behaviour is difference
(the element at the bottom of the table is hide, but the element

I think these should be same behaviour as a footer information.

Use -W (turn warnings into errors) option of sphinx-build
in the commandline of 'docs' tox target so that developer
can easily check sphinx warning.

Also runs the same documentation check in 'pep8' tox target
to detect sphinx warning in the gate.
The current 'docs' job in the gate does not use 'tox -edocs'
intentionally and calls build_sphinx via 'tox -evenv' [1],
so sphinx warnings are not detected in the 'docs' job.

Note that we no longer generate the whole code reference so this
change does not increase the time of 'tox -epep8' much,
while we can prevent new sphinx warnings.

We have a latent race in the libvirt firewall code when setting
up static filters which is now an error with libvirt>=1.2.7,
which is why we started seeing this in CI failures starting in
newton which run on xenial nodes that have libvirt 1.3.1 (but
didn't see it on trusty nodes with libvirt 1.2.2).

Libvirt commit 46a811db0731cedaea0153fc223faa6096cee5b5 checks
for an existing filter with the same name but a different uuid
when defining network filters and raises an error if found. That
was added in the 1.2.7 release.

This change simply handles the error and ignores it so we don't
fail to boot the instance.

Unfortunately we don't have a specific error code from libvirt
when this happens so the best we can do is compare the error
message from the libvirt error which is only going to work for
English locales because the error message from libvirt is
translated.

horizon devref has both explicit autodoc directives and
automatically generated source references.
This causes a lot of 'WARNING: duplicate object description'.

I think that we don't need source code references for most modules
and it is better to have explicit API references of modules
for which we need references. Thus this commit removes the logic
to generate source references.

This contributes a lot to reduce the number of sphinx warnings.
Also reduces the required time of documentation build :-)

Change the 'nova_service_names' from a list to a dictionary mapping
of services, groups that install those services. This brings the
method into line with that used in the os_neutron role in order to
implement a more standardised method.

The init tasks have been updated to run once and loop through this
mapping rather than being included multiple times and re-run against
each host. This may potentially reduce role run times.

Currently the reload of upstart/systemd scripts may not happen if
only one script changes as the task uses a loop with only one result
register. This patch implements handlers to reload upstart/systemd
scripts to ensure that this happens when any one of the scripts
change.

The handler to reload the services now only tries to restart the
service if the host is in the group for the service according to the
service group mapping. This allows us to ensure that handler
failures are no longer ignored and that no execution time is wasted
trying to restart services which do not exist on the host.

Finally:
- Common variables shared by each service's template files have
  been updated to use the service namespaced variables.
- Unused handlers have been removed.
- Unused variables have been removed.

For some reason the leaded descriptor warning message coming
from LVM is causing Cinder to fail startup and it appears to be
masking out the vg response in vgs calls.

We typically don't hit this, but due to the nature of Kolla and
I guess going through the different processes via the containers
this gets logged every time vgs is called.  Eric Harney rightly
pointed out that rather than use exception handling and such
that we should use the LVM env variable mechanism we already have
in place in Cinder.

For now this patch added a new config option to the LVM driver:
    lvm_suppress_fd_warnings=True|False

This is useful for K8 deployments that have an indirect call to the
LVM cmds which results in failures.

For those that are interested, this can also be done outside of
cinder by setting the silence_logs variable in lvm.conf

This is made optional as a config flag to avoid any breakage for
existing deployments during upgrade.

DocImpact: Need to add info regarding config update to docs

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ============================ Fetch Policy by Endpoint URL ============================ `bp fetch-policy-by-url <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/fetch-policy-by-url>`_ When fetchting the policy associated with an endpoint, use the URI of the endpoint as the key. Problem Description =================== Keystone loves to assign UUIDs. When any resources is created, Keystone assigns it generates a new UUID and assignes that as the ID in the database. The rest of the world hates UUIDs. THe rest of the world wants to use the strings that it alreadys knows as the names for the resources. This is especially true of Puppet and other configuration management tools. They need to create entries for basre install, and the current patter of: create resource, record resource ID, use resource ID for all future work means that it has to maintain state across transactions. An endpoint does not know its own identity. It has neither the ID nor the URL recorded in the configuration file. In order to maintain a connection, either the endpoint needs a value, or an external system does. The URI is mappable to the endpoint. Since a single server is likely to be the implementation for multiple endpoints (admin, public, private) the Keystone server should return the same policy file regardless of which URL is requested. However, it is possible today to define different policy files for each endpoint. While this might be desired in some custom implementationsm, it will not be the norm. Proposed Change =============== Add an API for fetching the policy file for the endpoint that is keyed on the URL. Add an API for linking multiple endpoint entries together so that modifying the policy file assigned to one modifies it for all of them. Alternatives ------------ Maintain the rule that a user needs to do the lookup from URL to endpoint ID external to Keystone. This involves listing all endpoints for a server, assuming that the cller knows ther service. But actually, the caller would need to list the services, select the right one, and then list the endpoints. It is annoying. Maintain separate of the endpoints, and magically deduce which endpoint is desired, and then have the policy mechanism select the right policy file during enforcement time. This is would be veryhard, and provide very little real value. Security Impact --------------- At this point, it would have absolutely no security impact: it would not open up an APIs that are not already exposed, just provide a elided process to find a resource. Notifications Impact -------------------- Existing notifications are sufficient for the fetch. A notification for the linking of endpoints might be desired, but is not essential. Other End User Impact --------------------- This will require a corresponding change in Keystone client. It will also enable a corresponding change in Keystonemiddleware. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- During deployment, a configuration management tool caould use the value to update a database with the URL, and use that to keep the policy file in sync with the server. Developer Impact ---------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ayoung Adam Young ayoung@redhat.com Work Items ---------- These can be done in either order. * Implement linking of endpoints. * Implement fetch by URL. Keystone Client and CLI * Implement URL based fetch. Dependencies ============ Centralized Policies Fetch and Cache https://review.openstack.org/#/c/134655/ Centralized Policies Distribution Mechanism https://review.openstack.org/#/c/197980/ Documentation Impact ==================== Minimal. As all things, it needs to be documented. References ========== ",,311,0

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ======================== Policy Merge in Keystone ======================== `bp example <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/policy-merge>`_ Managing Policy By composing Fragments in the Keystone server. Problem Description =================== Policy in OpenStack is incredibly Static. Coupled with that, the defaults are not set up to scale. However, changing policy cluster wide is a difficult task. Many of the policy files have common sections, or section that vary slightly, but use the same rule names. This has the potential to confuse deployers, as well as contribute to security holes. While each of the project teams needs to be able maintain their own inventory of policy targets, they should be able to consume a common section from Keystone. Composing that common section is going to be a work in progress, and needs support from the Keystone server. With the various APIs for associating policy files with endpoints and services, Keystone now has a way to act as a system of record for policy. However, the policy files themselves are still opaque blobs, disjoint between services. Proposed Change =============== Add a new API for creating a new policy file by merging a set of existing policy files. For an initial implementation, Keystone will assume all of the policy files are JSON files. They will be parsed, and the set of rules merged into a single JSON file, which will be deserialized. A parameter on each file included will indicate how to treat conflicts between existing rules. The strategies are * FAIL: If two rules have the same key, the API will return an error code. * OVERRIDE: If two rules have the same key, the rule from the later file in the list will over-write the rule specified by the earlier file. * MAINTAIN: The first specification of a rule will be maintained, and conflicting definitions will be discarded. Once the merger is complete, a new policy entry will be available via the policy API, and can then be assigned to endpoint or services. Alternatives ------------ Merging and composing of the JSON blobs could be done off line. However, this is merely another way of implementing the same function, but without integrating it in with OpenStack. Security Impact --------------- As with most policy changes, this is designed to improve the security story of OpenStack deployments. By itself, this change will have no impact. However, when coupled with the ability to distribute policy files based on the associations, the policy will be more dynamic, and can lead to an improvement or degradation based on the quality of the review and distribution process. Notifications Impact -------------------- The notifications will be the same as any other policy creation event. To date, there is no notification sent for this, but if one is added in the future, it should work the same for a merge as for an upload. Other End User Impact --------------------- Keystone client will need an additional function call to the policy API to manage this call. OpenStack Client will also need an option to trigger the call. Performance Impact ------------------ None, calls to this API should be very rare. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- This is a work flow change, but will not materially impact the general deployment of OpenStack until tooling takes advantage of the Associations. Once that happens, the overall work flow will look like this: * Create Keystone Server and call bootstrap. This will initialize Keystone's policy file. * Upload a common policy fragment. * Create a Nova Service entry via the CLI. * Upload the Nova policy fragment. * Merge the Common fragment with Nova * Association the new merged policy file with Nova. * Create a Nova Endpoint * Register the Nova endpoint. * Distribute the associated policy file to the new Nova endpoint. Developer Impact ---------------- API Developers wokring on policyh will be able to think in terms of common policy fragments. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: ayoung Adam Young ayoung@redhat.com Work Items ---------- * Server Should be done in a single commit. * Client Code * Deployment tooling. Dependencies ============ No external dependencies. However, the coming change to let Oslo policy render to YAML or other formats might complicate the merge process.

Problem Description =================== Policy files are blobs. WHile the consumers may parse them, all Keystone knows is that the file has been stored in it. It provides no way to check if two policy files are identical, allowing a remote system some way to decide to synchronize. However, most of the content management systems chec a hash of the file to see if the contents have change or not. Proposed Change =============== The ID assigned to a newly uploaded policy file will be the SHA256 (configurable) has of the content of the file. If a policy file is changed via a PATCH, a new policy file, with the hashed value of the contents will be created. The ID of the new resource will be returned in the response. Alternatives ------------ Make user download the file and diff. Security Impact --------------- None. Policy files are seldom changed resources, and only modifable via administrators. The rules of changing them are the same. Notifications Impact -------------------- Current notifications are in effect. Other End User Impact --------------------- Keystone client should return the new policy id after modifications. Performance Impact ------------------ None Other Deployer Impact --------------------- When a system like Puppet of Ansible refers to a file, the file will be identified by a short version that will allow the remote system to identify if it already has the version specified. This should simplify things for deployment. Developer Impact ---------------- A singel configuration value should select the Hash algorithm used. There are working examples of this kind of hash selection already in use. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Adam Young ayoung@redhat.com Work Items ---------- 1. Upload. 2.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =================== Dynamic RBAC Policy =================== `bp dynamic-policy <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/dynamic-policy>`_ OpenStack uses a Role-Based Access Control mechanism to manage authorization, which defines if a user is able to perform actions on resources based on the roles he has assigned on them. Resources include VMs, volumes, networks, etc and are organized into projects, which are owned by domains. Users have roles assigned on domains or projects. Users get scoped token on domains or projects, which contains the roles the user has assigned on them, and pass this token along to services in requests to perform actions on resources. The service check the roles in the token against the rules defined for the requested action on the policy.json file to define if the user has enough privilegies. This specification gives an overview of the new concept being introduced to solve those known limitations: Dynamic Policy. A set of specs will be addressing details on the incremental changes proposed in this spec. Problem Description =================== Policy files are service-specific and contain a list of available API endpoints and their respective authorization constraints. They are maintained on project specific source code repositories. This requires the use of an out-of-band mechanism to customize and place the policy file in the service respective server. In addition, this leads to cross- project inconsistency across global roles like admin and owner. Due to the limitations described above, the current architecture cannot be easily extended to cover user requests for new features like project or domain specific policies and user interface being able to determine what users are capable of doing based on their roles. The policy mechanism as it exists right now performs two functions. The primary function is the scope check: does the project id from the token match the project id for the requested resource. THe second function is confirming that the user has the appropriate role for the operation. However, to date, only one role is ever checked, and that is the admin role. The existing policy is based on the nam,e of an api, such as `identity::create_user` which does not match the URL used to perform the action. Thus, there is no way for an external tool to match URL to required role. Proposed Change =============== When a web call comes in to a remote service, after the auth_token middleware has expanded the token data, perform a role check according to the following rules. - The Endpoint section of the URL is parsed out, and used to fetch a policy file from Keystone. THis policy file will be cached. - The Policy file will be Keyed based on the URIs as defined by the identity API in the form VERB URI. For example, DELETE /users/{user_id}. - The form of the rules will be role:role_name. The norm will be a single role, but multple can be specified combined by the `or` rule. - An explicit override will allow any rule to be executed if the token contains both the role:admin and the indicator is_admin_project. - If the policy check succeeds, an additional header is added to the request. -XRBAC_CHECK_SUCCEEDED - If No rule matches, and no default rule has been set, the RBAC check will return True but will ensure the header -XRBAC_CHECK_SUCCEEDED is removed from the request. - If the check fails, the Middleare will return the HTTP response `403 Forbidden` Security Impact --------------- As noted elsewhere, security is a process. The end state should be a set of mechanisms that provide for a better security workflow. The dynamic roles will allow a user to delegate the appropriate set of permissions for the task that the user is trying to complete; this means that the net exposure from a token compromise will be much smaller. Notifications Impact -------------------- Any notification impact will be annotated in the subordinate specs. Other End User Impact --------------------- Once policy is served out of the new management API, users will be able to determine what permissions they may perform based on the roles they have assigned. For Horizon, this has the potential to allow the UI to display only those actions that the user can potentially perform, and tailor the user experience accordingly. Performance Impact ------------------ Dynamic Policy should have little impact on the normal function of OpenStack process, both inside and outside Keystone. The size of policy rule files will increase, but the changes should be minimal. There is always the possibility that the management of the policy rules in the database will have some hidden complexity, but managing these should be a very rare operation. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- The set of standard roles will now be able to evolve over time. This will allow a deployment to map the roles specific to their organization to the set of operations in OpenStack. The expectations will likewise increase. As a result, deployers will have to put more thought and design into policy rules. Developer Impact ---------------- As described above, policy will become inspectable. That means that all of the user experience can be tailored. Aside from Horizon, the CLI may want to take advantage of this operation, perhaps to warn users ahead of time that the operation they want to perform may not be allowed.

THis value needs to match the value in the Keystone configuragion file, and jhand editing is error prone.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =================== Unified Access Info =================== `bp accessinfo <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/accessinfo>`_ Reduce code duplication by having a single representation of the Access Information of the Keystone token. Problem Description =================== Keystone tokens are references to a set of data used to make authorization decisions. Several different functions exist to munge the data for processing: policy enforcement, revocation events, and the token provider all have duplicate code that performs roughly the same logic. Some of these same operations need to be performed by clients of the Keystone service. Policy and revocation events both need to be called by middleware running in remote services. Proposed Change =============== Convert the following code to use the AccessInfo as specified in the Keystone client: * keystone/contrib/revoke/model.py:build_token_values * keystone/middleware/core.py:AuthContextMiddleware * keystone/token/provider:TokenProvider.validate_token * keystone/token/provider:TokenProvider.issue_token Make it easy to compose an AccessInfo from the following sources: * JSON representation of the Token * Raw Database queries Make sure the following can accept the AccessInfo * policy_api.enforce_policy * revocation_api.is_token_valid Alternatives ------------ This is a code cleanup effort. Not doing it will prevent code maintainence. Security Impact --------------- Describe any potential security impact on the system. Some of the items to consider include: * Does this change touch sensitive data such as tokens, keys, or user data? * Yes, tokens * Does this change alter the API in a way that may impact security, such as a new way to access sensitive information or a new way to login? * Yes tokens. * Does this change involve cryptography or hashing? * No * Does this change require the use of sudo or any elevated privileges? * No * Does this change involve using or parsing user-provided data? This could be directly at the API level or indirectly such as changes to a cache layer. * Yes. It involves parsing the token data. This is already performed, and will reduce the number of places this parsing is done in the code. * Can this change enable a resource exhaustion attack, such as allowing a single API interaction to consume significant server resources? Some examples of this include launching subprocesses for each connection, or entity expansion attacks in XML. * No Notifications Impact -------------------- No changes to notifications Other End User Impact --------------------- * The AccessInfo code will live in Keystone client. * Should provide a unified API for interacting with the Data in the tokens. Performance Impact ------------------ By unifyingthe pasting of Tokekn data, we should have a single place to optimize if it should prove to impact performance. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- * No new config options * Change is in effect immediately. * No new binary * Internal change only no external impact. Developer Impact ---------------- Should simplify developer interactions with the Token data. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: morgainfainberg Other contributors: jamielennox ayoung Work Items ---------- * Idenitfy changes required to AccessInfo to support above used cases * Release updated client if necessary * Update Keystone server code to use AccessInfo Dependencies ============ * May require update to Keystone client Documentation Impact ==================== Once the AccessInfo is updated, developer documentation should make clear how and why to use the AccessInfo when working with tokens.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================= Policy Relational Database Schema ================================= `bp example <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/policy-database>`_ Generate the policy.json file from individual rules managed in a database schema behind Keystone. Problem Description =================== In order to enforce a common policy mechanism across OpenStack, we need to be able to have common definitions for roles. The policy engine needs to interpret these roles. But the Hierarchical role scheme is going to be common across multiple OpenStack projects. That means that the policy engine needs to get data generated from the role definitions. Proposed Change =============== Create a Database Schema that reflects the current policy engine rules. Allow the import of the existing policy.json files, deconflicting of duplicate rule defintions, and the definitions of new rules. Produce a new policy.json file that reflects the managed set of rules. Alternatives ------------ Manage the rules manually. This is labor intensive and error prone. Security Impact --------------- Describe any potential security impact on the system. Some of the items to consider include: * Does this change touch sensitive data such as tokens, keys, or user data? * Yes, policy files. * Does this change alter the API in a way that may impact security, such as a new way to access sensitive information or a new way to login? * Yes. It rewrites policy rules * Does this change involve cryptography or hashing? * No * Does this change require the use of sudo or any elevated privileges? * No * Does this change involve using or parsing user-provided data? This could be directly at the API level or indirectly such as changes to a cache layer. * Yes. The policy.json files need to be merged from the indivdual project repos. The Merging process will require both parsing of JSON and deconflicting of rules. * Can this change enable a resource exhaustion attack, such as allowing a single API interaction to consume significant server resources? Some examples of this include launching subprocesses for each connection, or entity expansion attacks in XML. * No. Once the JSON file is generated once, it should be managed by Dogpile. Notifications Impact -------------------- Changes to the policy rules will require sending a notification. Other End User Impact --------------------- Aside from the API, are there other ways a user will interact with this feature? * Does this change have an impact on python-keystoneclient? What does the user interface there look like? Performance Impact ------------------ Should have no performance impact. Generating the policy.json files will be done once, and then cached for future requests. They should be static during normal operations. Other Deployer Impact --------------------- Discuss things that will affect how you deploy and configure OpenStack that have not already been mentioned, such as: * The Dynamic backend will be a different Backend for the policy API. Configuration will require enabling it as teh Driver in the [policy] section of keystone.conf. Developer Impact ---------------- This is tied in with the larger effort on policy. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: ayoung@redhat.com Other contributors: <launchpad-id or None> Work Items ---------- * Define the schema * Define the upload mechanims * Generate the policy files * Define the individual rule mechanism * Support the per-endpong assignment extension Dependencies ============ * This is stand alone feature, but can be used in conjunction with numerous other policy modifcations in the work, most notably hierarchical roles. It is more likely that Hierarchical roles will depend on this spec than the reverse. Documentation Impact ==================== Use of the feature needs to be documented in the configuration guide.

This changes up devstack code to make sure OVS does the right thing
after upgrading. After the neutron upgrade, it uses a new OVS tag for
networking, so this changes things over to the new one.

Make sure that we remove all resources that were created during
resources phase.

Set tempest fixed_network_name explicitly as it is prerequirement for
ironic, see reference.

The utility_all group was not added to nova and the tempest tests are
not being run against the tempest host.

Additionally, scheduling fails if the ansible_host for localhost is
""localhost"", it needs to be set to an IP to prevent failures such as:

ValueError: failed to detect a valid IP address from 'localhost'

The defaulted ""neutron_provider_networks"" in the common test repository
takes precedence over the host_vars in the repository, we need to change
this by setting it in the nova-overrides.

This PR fixes that.

Using OVS transaction mutate support causes the updated column to
be an empty list after the mutation. This results in subsequent
actions taken based on the column data to be incorrect. The column
data is accurate again once the current transaction completes. It
appears that the OVS python IDL is not properly handling getattr()
after column mutation.

This workaround is needed until OVS is fixed. The workaround drops
transaction mutate support for logical router static routes since
they require numerous column data comparisions within a single
transaction. In addition, OVN DB sync ACL processing had to be
modified to ensure mutations wouldn't impact any comparison. At
this time, no other problems where identified.

The functional tests were updated to test the logical router
static routes problem and other paths with multiple commands
within a mutate transaction.

Recent neutron relocations also required a couple minor unit
test updates.

The 'versions' response contains the status of the Images API versions,
but does not indicate the releases when the statuses went into effect.
This patch adds a Version History to the 'versions' api-ref page.  The
language used (for example, ""Bexar changes"") is consistent with what's
been adopted for other parts of the images api-ref (see the discussion
on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/356693/ )

Patch tests basic life-cycle of a trunk associated with a port. Test
creates a trunk with one subport - this tests interaction between
agent and ovsdb handler that calls via RPC to server.
Later a new subport is added which tests RPC interaction between
server and agent. Then deletes the first created subport. Finally trunk
is removed and checked that no patch ports remain on the integration
bridge.

Future work:
 - Run this test with linuxbridge
 - Test re-using port associated with trunk.
 - Test re-using subports.
 - Test with OVS firewall.

We're seeing a lot of failures for loading the neutron-linuxbridge-agent
on localhost in gating. There is a race condition that means the service
start is attempted before the configuration file is placed.

Although, this doesn't happen all the time - it suggests the static
inclusion on the init tasks may well be causing this error.

The ""heat resource-mark-unhealthy"" (or ""openstack stack resource mark

will cause Heat to create a replacement during the next stack update,
while still respecting all of the dependency relationships within the
template (so e.g. if a server gets replaced then floating IPs get moved

The check for determining if a device was GPT partioned was incorrect.

This was due to the fact that the blkid output for a GPT partioned
device would have been: ('gpt\n', '') and the test was checking for
'gpt' in the output.

This patch includes a couple of small functional test improvement.

A. Change swift_test_client.File.sync_metadata to follow Swift object
metadata semantics:

swift_test_client.File.sync_metadata is designed to post object user
metadata to an object. However, prior to this patch, the
swift_test_client.File instance keeps the existing object metadata as
its member attribute and if sync_metadata is called, it sends both
existing metadata and incomming metadata from caller. It looks to result
in the odd state as if Swift keeps the existing metadata when POST
object requested.

To tell the correct Swift object metadata semantics, when POST object
requested, the existing metadata in the stored object should be gone
even if no metadata is overwritten.

i.e.
if POST object with 'X-Object-Meta-Key: Val' to a stored object with
'X-Object-Meta-foo: bar', it will result in an object with
'X-Object-Meta-Key' (note that X-Object-Meta-Foo will be deleted)

The prior behavior sometimes make us confused in the reviw [1] so that,
this patch fixes it to send only incomming metadata if it's set.

B. Check the response status code more strictly for ObjectVersioning case

This patch fixes test_versioning_check_acl on both TestObjectVersioning and
TestObjectVersioningHistoryMode to assert the response status code
explisitly instead of asserting just ""ResponseError"". (e.g. 403 when trying
to delete object from other account)

This patch moves network-related heat output processing
from Instance class to Network subclasses
There are 2 reasons for this patch:
1. Instance::ipAddresses should be retrieved from Network subclasses
instead of direct reading Heat template output in Instance.
In current implementation ipAddresses property initialized
from Instance output in Heat template.
The same information can be retrieved via Instance::joinedNetworks
property with Network method usage.
It breaks single responsibility principle.
2. Implementation details of resource classes methods
should be hidden from Instance objects

Mounting loopback highly available shares is not supported.

The Hyper-V Nova driver needs a way to check whether a share is
local and use the local path in that case.

This change adds a method that attempts to resolve the share server
address and compare the IPs with the local IPs.

In case of a share exposed by a Scale-Out server, we'll use the
Distributed Node Name of the share, which points to all the nodes
of the cluster.

ddt is added as a requirement.

Problem description =================== In the context of optimizing a Cluster it is realistic that we might want to fulfill multiple Goals in a single Audit. However, the definition of a Strategy that considers multiple Goals and suggests the optimal course of Actions can be a very complex and time consuming task. The performance impact of applying multi-objective optimization in real-time Audit evaluation would be significant and could risk the effectiveness and efficiency of the Watcher framework. Another challenge of this problem is that depending on the identified Goals there might be conflicting Actions that will have to be taken. In addition, the priority or importance of each Goal could play a significant role in the definition of the flow of Actions and Strategy compiled. In this specification we are capturing some potential changes to the Watcher architecture and operation that would allow to consider multiple Goals in an Audit but still handle the Strategy generation independent to each Goal, thus simplifying the Action Plan definition. The rational of this suggested solution is to keep the alterations of the existing Watcher architecture to a minimum level and provide an effective and simple solution that could be integrated into the existing architecture. The actor responsible for setting that priority of the Goals and therefore the Action Plans is the Administrator and he is also responsible for dealing with potential conflicts of objectives. The consolidated Action Plan will be a sub-optimum solution to the multi-objective Audit but is an initial step towards the aggregation of multiple Action Plans. The described feature will be delivered as an optional, independent module that could be integrated with the Watcher Decision Engine. Use Cases ---------- The actor involved and affected from this specification is the Administrator. The functionality described here would allow the Administrator of a Cluster to define Audit Templates and Audits that include more than one Goals. Following that, when triggering the Audit, the Watcher Decision Engine would compose a respective Action Plan that aggregates the flows of Actions for each Goal. Project Priority ----------------- TBD Proposed change =============== For the suggested consolidation of multiple Action Plans we are making the following assumptions: * an Audit can contain more than one Goals * if more than one Goals are defined, they need to be prioritized in an ordered way. * there are no specific information about the actions and we cannot parallelize the execution of two Action Plans. * if there is a conflict of Actions between two Action Plans (e.g. apply a change over the same resource), the Action in the plan with higher priority prevails. For the realization of this mechanism changes have to be performed at the definition of Audit Templates and Audits. The Administrator should be able to define more than one Goals in the respective resources. Subsequently, that might affect the Watcher API triggered through the Watcher CLI and also minor changes might be needed in the Watcher Database in order to support that structure. The more important changes are related with the Watcher Decision Engine. This component will be responsible for acquiring the Strategy and afterwards the Action Plan for each Goal, and then trigger the consolidation algorithm. The rational of the consolidation is that the Action Plan with higher priority is executed first and then the rest Action Plans follow in the correct order. If an Action has already been performed then is skipped. If an Action contradicts a previously executed Actions then the first is skipped as well. Alternatives ------------ Alternative consolidation algorithms could be applied in order to aggregate the Action Plans of an Audit. If we could extrapolate dependency information from the available Actions then we could parallelize the execution of the Actions and transform the problem to a scheduling one. For example, a live migration of a VM could be performed in parallel with the changing of the power level of a different compute node. In relation with that approach, the problem could be formulated as a Job Shop Scheduling problem with A the collection of Actions that can performed independently, P the collection of Action Plans resulted from the Audit. Based on the Actions dependencies, the dependencies of the given Action Plans could be identified and then the optimum scheduling of the plan execution could be performed. Data model impact ----------------- There are no major changes needed to the Data model. The dependency between an Audit template and the Goal needs to be one-to-many. REST API impact --------------- There is no impact on the REST API. Security impact --------------- There is no impact on the Security. Notifications impact -------------------- There is no impact on the notifications. Other end user impact --------------------- The end user (administrator) could select multiple Goals in an Audit template. Performance Impact ------------------ The consolidation module will be triggered every time that an Audit with multiple Goals is being processed. While the suggested operation is simply an aggregation and ordering mechanism, the performance impact would be minimal. Other deployer impact --------------------- No specific deployer impact is envisaged. Developer impact ---------------- It will not impact other developers working on OpenStack. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Intel is leading this work. Main assignee: Gregory Katsaros <gregory-katsaros> Secondary assignee: Thijs Metsch <tmetsch> Work Items ---------- Workplan: * Finalization of the conceptual methodology * Updates on Wathcer APIs and architecture. Definition of Consolidator APIs and introduction of mock-up module. * Implementation of Consolidator * Integration and testing Dependencies ============ No direct dependencies. Testing ======= Several unit tests will be provided to test scenarios using a mock-up Audits and Goals models. Testing approaches similar to the basic consolidation strategy will be used, comprising of unit tests and integration tests in which a specific input is given and compared against the expected output. Documentation Impact ==================== It will be necessary to add new content relating to this Audit and Action Plans operation of the Watcher Decision Engine.

Change the 'heat_service_names' from a list to a dictionary mapping
of services, groups that install those services. This brings the
method into line with that used in the os_neutron role in order to
implement a more standardised method.

The init tasks have been updated to run once and loop through this
mapping rather than being included multiple times and re-run against
each host. This may potentially reduce role run times.

Currently the reload of upstart/systemd scripts may not happen if
only one script changes as the task uses a loop with only one result
register. This patch implements handlers to reload upstart/systemd
scripts to ensure that this happens when any one of the scripts
change.

The handler to reload the services now only tries to restart the
service if the host is in the group for the service according to the
service group mapping. This allows us to ensure that handler
failures are no longer ignored and that no execution time is wasted
trying to restart services which do not exist on the host.

Finally:
- Common variables shared by each service's template files have
  been updated to use the service namespaced variables.
- Unused handlers have been removed.
- Unused variables have been removed.

Previously the chown command wasn't traversing symlinks, causing
the new ownership to not be set for some needed files.

This change also ensures the crush map tunables are set to the 'default'
profile after the upgrade.

Finally redirects the output of a pidof to /dev/null to avoid spurious
logging.

Node group templates require a ""floating IP pool"" is basically an external
network.
`openstack network list --external` seems to work since Liberty (at least)
and it should work with nova-network too (warning: untested).

The alternative (back to `openstack ip floating pool list`) is blocked by
a regression (it works only with nova-network).

On the other side, the cluster template requires a project network.
The only suitable generic function from Tempest is used, even if
unstable (the cost of rewriting one is higher than fixing the
possible breakages).

The timeout set in tempest.conf is now used for the cluster creation.

The allowed name characters are lowercase letters, dash ``-``, and underscore ``_``. * ``title`` -- Human-readable plugin name displayed on the Fuel web UI. * ``version`` -- Plugin version. For guidelines, see `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 <http://semver.org/>`_. * ``fuel_version`` -- The Fuel version that your plugin is compatible with. Currently, the builder verifies ``fuel_version`` only against ``package_version``. The ``package_version`` field must be supported by the Fuel versions listed at the bottom of this section. Leaving this field empty will skip the check. For format guidelines, see `_ClassType StrictVersion <http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/stdlib/distutils.version.StrictVersion-class.html>`_. * ``licenses`` -- List the licenses under which your plugin can be distributed. * ``authors`` -- Name of the plugin author. A company or an individual. * ``homepage`` -- A link to page with your plugin. This can be your plugin's GitHub repository page. * ``is_hotpluggable`` -- State if the plugin is hot-pluggable. See :ref:`plugin-hotpluggable`. * ``groups`` -- A group to which your plugin belongs in the Fuel web UI. * ``releases`` -- A list of OpenStack releases compatible with the plugin. * ``releases: os`` -- A compatible Linux distribution for the plugin. The supported values are ``ubuntu`` and ``centos``. Fuel 8.0 supports only Ubuntu. * ``releases: version`` -- A compatible OpenStack release version. Fuel Plugin Builder does not validate the ``releases: version`` field; but if there is no OpenStack release with the same version on the Fuel Master, the user cannot enable the plugin. See also a note in :ref:`install-plugin-builder`. * ``releases: mode`` -- A list of compatible cluster deployment modes. Fuel 8.0 supports only the ``haz`` value. * ``releases: deployment_scripts_path`` -- A path in your plugin directory where all the deployment scripts for the release are. The path is relative to the plugin root. * ``releases: repository_path`` -- A path in your plugin directory where all the packages for the release are. Relative to the plugin root. * ``package_version`` -- A version of the compatible plugin format. To build your plugin, the Fuel Plugin Builder version must be the same as the version of the compatible plugin format or newer. Each new plugin format version introduces new features and, possibly, deprecates some of the old ones. The Fuel master node must support the specific ``package_version``, otherwise, you cannot install the plugin. ",,104,53

The NS metadata proxy pid cleanup process hunts for and removes
PIDs executing old code by using version tags. Under certain
conditions it's possible for an old PID to have expired before
the cleanup action has run. This change simply wraps the
`pkill` command with a test to ensure the task isn't failing.
Should a PID actually be cleaned up the task will print to stdout

This blueprint proposes to create a new heat resource type for nova quotas. Problem description =================== Today, an administrator can create a new keystone project using heat using a template similar to this: .. code-block:: yaml resources: test_role: type: OS::Keystone::Role properties: name: test_role test_project: type: OS::Keystone::Project properties: name: test_project enabled: True test_user: type: OS::Keystone::User properties: name: test_user domain: default default_project: {get_resource: test_project} roles: - role: {get_resource: test_role} domain: default - role: {get_resource: test_role} project: {get_resource: test_project} However, to specify the default nova quota associated with the project, the administrator would need to execute post-orchestration something similar to: .. code-block:: bash $ os quota set --cores 5 --ram 51200 <project> Use Cases --------- As an Openstack admin, I would like to manage projects holistically. Templates that will define the project, the users to project membership and the allocated quotas. Proposed change =============== This blueprint proposes to add a new resource type ``OS::Nova::Quota`` to heat to address the problem described. A sample ``OS::Nova::Quota`` template: .. code-block:: yaml resources: nova_quota: type: OS::Nova::Quota properties: project: {get_param: project} cores: 5 fixed_ips: 5 floating_ips: 5 instances: 5 injected_files: 5 injected_file_content_bytes: 5 injected_file_path_bytes: 5 key_pairs: 5 metadata_items: 5 ram: 5 security_groups: 5 security_group_rules: 5 server_groups: 5 server_group_members: 5 outputs: nova_quota_id: value: {get_resource: nova_quota} **Properties**: * project: - **required**: True - **type**: String - **description**: OpenStack keystone project * cores: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the number of cores - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 * fixed_ips: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the number of fixed IPs - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 * floating_ips: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the number of floating IPs - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 * instances: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the number of instances - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 * injected_files: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the number of injected files - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 * injected_file_content_bytes: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the number of injected file content bytes - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 * injected_file_path_bytes: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the number of injected file path bytes - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 * key_pairs: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the number of key pairs - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 * metadata_items: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the number of metadata items - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 * ram: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the amount of ram (in megabytes) - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 * security_groups: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the number of security groups - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 * security_group_rules: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the number of security group rules - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 * server_groups: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the number of server groups - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 * server_group_members: - **type**: Integer - **description**: Quota for the number of server group members - **contraints**: Range minimum is -1 We will add a default policy rule for this resource to be limited to administrators. .. code-block:: json ""resource_types:OS::Nova::Quota"": ""rule:project_admin"" This Quota Resource will handle create, update, and delete. For handling create and update, the resource will call the Nova client's quota-set update method, since there is no quota create call. For the handling delete, the Resource will call the Nova client's quota delete method. This will reset the quota to the default value. Note that creating multiple resources and deleting one will reset the quota even though other resources still exist. Alternatives ------------ The administrator or the operator can change a project's default quota manually post project orchestration. The OS::Keystone::Project can contain an optional Quota property. However, the addition seems out of Keystone's scope, since Keystone has no concept of quotas. Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: * Yosef Hoffman - yohoffman Additional assignees: * Julian Sy - syjulian * Andy Hsiang - yh418t Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: ocata Work Items ---------- * Implement new resource type OS::Nova::Quota * Implement appropriate unit and functional tests Dependencies ============ None ",,225,0

Those objects are intentionally not integrated into the database code so
far. This is to quicken access to their definitions to implement
push-notifications for security groups and ports.

The object embeds segmentation information in addition to what's
available through the model. Specifically, binding_levels field exposes
all ml2 binding levels, that from their side load corresponding network
segment object. The order for level objects in binding_levels list field
is guaranteed to be in the order of level. So the consumers can eg.
access the bottom binding info with:

For PortBindingLevel object, we want to expose segmentation info. This
is achieved through a 'segment' ObjectField. The database model itself
contains segment_id too. There is no reason though to expose it for
Level object in two places (one as a model field, another one through

handles loading for ObjectField based synthetic fields was assuming that
objects always have a field per model attribute, so it needed a slight
adjustment to support this case, where we extract foreign_keys

In some situations, we may have to handle instances that are located
at a different path than the configured one. For example, this can
happen in case of failed over instances when multiple CSVs are used
among hosts.

This change will let the driver locate the instance files in this
situation.

I won't bore you with my professional accomplishments. If you want to see such information to judge if I'm qualified for serving you on the technical committee team, that information is available in my foundation profile linked at the bottom of this self-nomination or on LinkedIn. I'll get straight to the point instead. I believe in OpenStack's mission. I believe in the OpenStack way. I believe in the Four Opens. I believe in the OpenStack principles. I believe in OpenStack itself. I believe Open Source has changed the world of computing in a fundamentally more effective way. Most importantly, I believe the diversity of opinions and teams in our community are what make OpenStack special. I'm a believer. I think the TC has done a reasonable job of managing OpenStack's tremendous technical growth. If you want a history lesson from my point of view on why OpenStack is the way it is today, please reference my Newton technical committee self-nomination [1]. The Big Tent needs some fine tuning, and the technical committee is working to make that occur. Fine tuning to me doesn't mean we need to overthrow years of progress because some folks perceive OpenStack as having an identiity crisis. I also don't believe defending the status quo represents fine tuning. Fine tuning to me means making incremental improvements to the state of the art. This is how we develop software in OpenStack after a community around the software has been bootstrapped. Lets face reality for a moment. OpenStack does have some problems. They all stem from various choices made along the OpenStack journey. There are five types of consumers of OpenStack's software: application developers of the operator's clouds consumers of the operator's clouds infrastructure developers of the OpenStack software operators operating clouds produced by the developers of the OpenStack software openstack distributors This problem so far has gone unacknowledged. The problem to be solved with OpenStack is ensuring the above five types of consumers of OpenStack's software are served fairly, equally, with respect, and most importantly effectively. These are the individuals our community represents. This is an extremely difficult problem to solve. Can it be solved alone by any individual? NO. Can in be solved by the technical committee? NO. Can it be solved by the technical committee and various other working groups involved in making OpenStack tick? NO. Can it be solved by our community of developers, core reviewers, project team leads, technical committee team, operators, working groups, OpenStack distributors working in concert? I am hopeful. I am a tenacious problem solver. If you make a choice to select me as your technical committee representative, I will dedicate myself to working with the technical committee to facilitate a solution to this problem just as I have done in other leaderhsip service roles inside the OpenStack community. While working to solve this problem, I will keep driving OpenStack forward to the horizon with the help of your vote and the technical committee.

Some of you may know me, I've been around the OpenStack community for a while (longer than some, shorter than others). I'm not an ""uber hipster"", or a ""super cool bro-grammer"", or even a ""mega hacker"" trying to write the most clever code possible to impress everyone. I am however someone that has been contributing to OpenStack for about five years now. Not only via code contributions, but services, support and evangelism. I started the Cinder project with some great help from a few other folks and did the best I could with that while forging ahead into unknown territory. I use OpenStack on a daily basis in a number of private clouds, have helped several average sized companies deploy and maintain OpenStack clouds and have spent countless hours helping people get their heads wrapped around the whole OpenStack Platform thing and how it might be able solve some of their problems. I'm not going to try and claim that I have all the answers related to OpenStack and the TC, in fact, I'm not even going to pretend to know what all the questions are. I'm not going to tell you what a great person I am, or all of my ""great achievements"" over the years. As we all know, people can write up whatever wonderful things. People can say or write up just about anything and promise the world without really having any idea what they're talking about. What I will say however, is that I believe OpenStack has changed dramatically over the last few years. Some things for the better, some things... not so much. While I think the past is extremely important for the experience it gives, I think what's more important and critical is the future and where OpenStack is going over the course of the next few years. OpenStack is a bit ambiguous for a lot of people that I talk to (both inside and outside of the community). Even more unclear is what do we want to be in another two years, three or even five? Do we want to just continue being a platform that kinda looks like AWS or a ""free"" version of VMware? Do we want our most popular topic at the key-notes to continue being customers telling their story of ""how hard"" it was to do OpenStack? I think we're at an important cross-roads with respect to the future of OpenStack. It's my belief that the TC has a great opportunity (with the right people) to take input from the ""outside world"" and drive a meaningful and innovative future for OpenStack. Maybe try and dampen the echo-chamber a bit, see if we can identify some real problems that we can help real customers solve. I'd like to see us embracing new technologies and ways of doing things. I'd love to have a process where we don't care so much about the check boxes of what oslo libs you do or don't use in a project, or how well you follow the hacking rules; but instead does your project actually work? Can it actually be deployed by somebody outside of the OpenStack community or with minimal OpenStack experience? It's my belief that Projects should offer real value as stand-alone services just as well as they do working with other OpenStack services. I should be able to use them equally as well outside the eco-system as in side of it. I believe the TC should consider driving issues like these and help guide the future of OpenStack. If you like my philosophy (really that's all it is), or agree with it; I'd love the opportunity to try and make some of this a reality. I can't promise anything, except that I'll try to do what I believe is good for the community (especially deployers and end-users). Feel free to ask me about my thoughts on anything specific, I'm happy to answer any questions that I can as honestly as I can. Thanks, John ",,72,0

An python library used to generate a given HOT template with given version. Problem description =================== There are different users, who needs a library to generate an valid HOT template, as given below: 1. Automation OpenStack heat service is getting used widely in other OpenStack services such as Murano, Magnum, Tacker, etc and some of these projects generate HOT template during the runtime as part of the automation supported by them. 2. Cloud providers Every Cloud providers uses different designer tools for drawing topology visually and each of these tool use it's own way to generate the HOT template, as heat does not provide sdk for hot template generation. Proposed change =============== HOT template has following aspects and model each of them as python programmable construct such as class and provide required/supporting python api for generating HOT template by writing the python code. * Version * Description * Parameters and Parameter group * Resources and Properties * Intrinsic Functions * Outputs * Environment An sample SDK is provided `here`_ as POC. .. _here: https://github.com/mkr1481/os-hot-gen This POC has modeled almost everything of above mentioned aspects and for functions it does provide only for get_param as an sample one, which can be extended further for other supported functions. Alternatives ------------ None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: kanagaraj-manickam jdob Milestones ---------- Target Milestone for completion: newton-2 Work Items ---------- * Make POC into stable version * Migrate the POC repository under OpenStack heat * Provide example python snippets to generate sample HOT templates * Add option to generate the Resource properties and outputs based on given resource type schema generated from heat service.

Graceful shutdown of l3 agent with migration of routers
served by it allows to minimize network disruption for
tenant VMs during the upgrade procedure.

Otherwise the abnormal shutdown of l3 agent causes routers
to be unavailable for 10s of minutes upon upgrade of the
first controller from the environment.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =============== Fuel LCM plugin =============== ------------------- Problem description ------------------- The Fuel project does a very good job at initial cluster deployment and configuration, but it lacks tools for supporting an already deployed cluster. Users will require a way to apply different fixes to the working cluster nodes, install updates, make changes and even add new services as well as auditing the currently running configuration. ---------------- Proposed changes ---------------- The Life Cycle Management plugin should make it possible for the cluster operators to use a custom Puppet manifests on the deployed cluster nodes. In order to achieve this goal a new type of the cluster nodes is introduced: LCM controller. This node can be deployed standalone or there can be several of them working as a HA cluster with load balancing. On the LCM nodes the Puppet master should be installed and all other cluster nodes should run Puppet agents against these Puppet master. Puppet masters should be able to use the existing Puppet modules which are being used during the Fuel deployment process as well as any additional Puppet modules and manifests a user will be willing to add. There manifests can be assigned to nodes using the Foreman dashboard. It allows user to add any of the defined Puppet manifests to nodes as well as to set the parameters for them. Manifests can also get cluster configuration information from the Hiera yaml files. These files will have to be gathered from the entire cluster as stored in a centralized database. The Puppet modules and manifests used to manage the cluster configuration can be stored in a separate Git repository. The LCM nodes should download the latest changes and add them to the Puppet master modules when requested. If there are several LCM nodes installed they should spread the Puppet agent connection between each other and the load balancer should be able to stop sending new connections to a failed or disabled LCM node and let the other nodes to take over the workload. Nailgun ======= This plugin required ad addition the the nailgun Web UI called ""tuningbox"". It adds a new tab to the cluster settings containing the configuration options for the LCM plugin. The centralized database ""ConfigDB"" used to store the collected Hiera yaml data will also be installed on the master node. Data model ---------- The additions to the cluster settings are stored in the Nailgun database. REST API -------- None Orchestration ============= RPC Protocol ------------ None Fuel Client =========== None Plugins ======= None Fuel Library ============ The LCM plugin is using a lot of the Fuel Library modules and manifests during its deployment and the manifests used to manage the servers can be based of the Fuel tasks too. -------------- Upgrade impact -------------- It should be possible to upgrade the LCM nodes by installing the newer version of the plugin by running the deployment on them again or by any other means. --------------- Security impact --------------- The security of the new LCM controller nodes and the ConfigDB service on the master node should be audited. -------------------- Notifications impact -------------------- None --------------- End user impact --------------- End user will be able to use the Web Dashboard on the LCM nodes to upload and run custom manifests on the running cluster. ------------------ Performance impact ------------------ None ----------------- Deployment impact ----------------- None ---------------- Developer impact ---------------- None --------------------- Infrastructure impact --------------------- There should be CI tasks to run the deployment and destructive tests of the new plugin nodes. -------------------- Documentation impact -------------------- The plugin should include documentation about its installation, usage, architecture and development. -------------- Implementation -------------- Assignee(s) =========== Primary assignee: Alexey Odinokov Other contributors: Aleksandr Kolinko Aleksey Kolodyazhnyy Alexander Noskov Alexei Vinogradov Alexey Chekunov Alexey Odinokov Dmitriy Stremkovskiy Dmitry Ilyin Dzmitry Stremkouski Scott Brimhall Sergey Levchenko Sergey Ryabin Stas Egorov Vasiliy Pleshakov Vladimir Maliaev Yuriy Taraday Mandatory design review: Alexey Odinokov Work Items ========== * Introduce tasks to install the required additions to the Fuel master node. * Develop a set of tasks to deploy the LCM nodes with database and web servers running. * Make tasks to gather the Hiera data and store it on the master node. * Deploy the Puppet master and the Dashboard on the LCM nodes. * Deploy the middleware on the LCM modes required to download the custom modules from the Git repository. * Deploy the load balancing services on the LCM nodes. Dependencies ============ None ----------- Testing, QA ----------- * The CI tasks should take a latest version of the plugin, install it on the supported Fuel master node and perform the deployment of a cluster with configured LCM nodes. * The CI task should check that the LCM nodes are working, the Dashboard is accessible and other services running. Acceptance criteria =================== The LCM plugin should successfully install the LCM nodes, configure the other nodes to work with them and should not interfere with the basic cluster functionality. * Web UI of the LCM nodes should be accessible from the public network through HTTPS protocol. * Puppet agent on the cluster nodes should successfully connect to the Puppet masters on the LCM nodes. * Foreman dashboard should be able to successfully apply a custom manifest downloaded from Git repository on any of the cluster nodes. * LCM nodes should survive rebooting as well as disabling one of three nodes. ---------- References ---------- 1.

In case, when we import DefaultAPIClient, it tries to instantiate

username and password parameters are not being parsed yet. It causes situation,
that it always instantiates with default credentials.
In order to prevent it, lazy initializer was created. APIClient.default_client

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode =================== Fuel plugins v5.0.0 =================== https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/plugins-v5 Fuel plugins packages v5.0.0 is introduced for the purpose of deprecating old-style v1.0.0 tasks format and providing cleaner and more consistent interface for Fuel plugins developers and enhance multiple releases support in single plugin package. ------------------- Problem description ------------------- We have several issues related to the Fuel plugins API: * Old-style tasks description format in tasks.yaml making package more complex. * Node role tasks groups and groups dependencies that are redundant declaration that makes tasks format harder to understand. * It's not possible to customize settings and deployment tasks depending on the release version. * Mixed tasks version is used: v1.0.0 and v2.0.0 * Lack of per-task orchestration sequencing directive ---------------- Proposed changes ---------------- Web UI ====== None Nailgun ======= General changes to the architecture, tasks and encapsulated business logic should be described here. Data model ---------- For multi-version plugins packages stored plugins configuration format could be changed according to the selected approach. REST API -------- None Orchestration ============= During interpreting plugin `node_roles.yaml` `tasks:` parameter should be unwrapped and according tasks with `type: group` with `id` and `roles` parameter equal to node role name should be created. After that `tasks:` parameter could be removed from node role information. RPC Protocol ------------ None Fuel Client =========== None Plugins ======= Plugins API is changed in v5.0.0. v5.0.0 will be compatible with Fuel v8.0 in experimental mode and higher with the default orchestrator enabled. Changes in v5.0.0 against v4.0.0 -------------------------------- * `node_roles.yaml` * optional `tasks: [“hiera”, “globals”, ... ]` parameter is added to replace tasks with `type: group` in `deployment_tasks.yaml` functionality. * `deployment_tasks.yaml` * `version: 2.0.0` is required * `parameters: strategy: type: parallel|one_by_one now` now could be defined for tasks * rename `role` to `roles` (TBD?) Deprecated items ---------------- * In `deployment_tasks.yaml` file `groups: [""my_node_role"", ...]` parameter in task definition is deprecated in deployment tasks parameters, `roles: [""my_node_role"", ...]` is supposed to be used instead. * In `deployment_tasks.yaml` file `type: group` tasks is not available for plugin developers and completely replaced with new `tasks` parameters in `node_roles.yaml`. * `tasks.yaml` file is deprecated and its content will be ignored. Multi-release packages ---------------------- Possible approaches to the multi-release packages: Variant 1 ^^^^^^^^^ OS release and fuel version constraints directives should be added to the records in such kind of records: * tasks * node roles * network roles * components (TBD?) * volumes_roles_mapping (TBD?) Example of `deployment_tasks.yaml`: .. code-block:: yaml - id: my-task mos-version: ""==2014.2,==2015.1"" fuel-version: "">=7,<=8"" parameters: puppet_manifest: ""deploy_legacy.pp"" puppet_modules: ""."" - id: my-task mos-version: "">=liberty-8.0"" fuel-version: "">=9"" parameters: puppet_manifest: ""deploy_10.pp"" puppet_modules: ""."" Please note that id is similar and this two records will form a multi-version group that will be interpreted as a single record according to current env and Fuel version. Version constraint is not required and its absence should be considered as all version supported. When plugin is validating it should be checked that tasks is fit into supported release. Plugin package structure is not changing. When plugin is activating for the environment all configuration records and tasks should be passed through version pre-processor that looks at all tasks/configs with version constraints then grouping records with the similar id or name and choosing best fit record (selection policy may vary) among those which satisfy current fuel and release version. If any of given constrains (OS, Fuel) could not be satisfied for current env, group should be ignored. After this stage version constraints information become not important and could be removed/ignored from the filtered tasks. `metatada.yaml` -> releases manifest data will be used as usual before tasks filtering process. Variant 2 ^^^^^^^^^ Per-release configuration files links In metadata.yaml -> releases is extended by directives where to look for configuration file for this release, or default path from current plugin configuration is used: .. code-block:: yaml conf_paths: - deployment_tasks node_roles network_roles volumes components environment_config Example of `metadata.yaml`: .. code-block:: yaml releases: - os: ubuntu version: 2015.1-8.0 mode: ['ha'] deployment_scripts_path: deployment_scripts/ repository_path: repositories/ubuntu conf_paths: - deployment_tasks_path: deployment_tasks_kilo.yaml - os: ubuntu version: liberty-8.0 mode: ['ha'] deployment_scripts_path: deployment_scripts/ repository_path: repositories/ubuntu conf_paths: - deployment_tasks_path: deployment_tasks_liberty.yaml Variant 3 ^^^^^^^^^ Per-release folders Only folder with plugin config files is specified for all releases in metadata.yaml. If no folder is defined or configuration file is missing in given folder root path is used. Example of `metadata.yaml`: .. code-block:: yaml releases: - os: ubuntu version: 2015.1-8.0 mode: ['ha'] deployment_scripts_path: deployment_scripts/ repository_path: repositories/ubuntu conf_path: librty-ubuntu/ - os: ubuntu version: liberty-8.0 mode: ['ha'] deployment_scripts_path: deployment_scripts/ repository_path: repositories/ubuntu conf_path: librty-ubuntu/ Fuel Library ============ * In tasks description `roles` alias for `role` parameter will occur. * It will be possible to define `tasks` parameter for node roles. ------------ Alternatives ------------ None -------------- Upgrade impact -------------- Plugins compatibility should be re-checked during upgrade according to new multi-version directives/packaging. --------------- Security impact --------------- None -------------------- Notifications impact -------------------- Fuel Plugin Builder =================== Fuel Plugin Builder validator should allow to make warnings without failing validation. * During validation of Plugin package v5.0.0 * Errors: * if no `version: 2.0.0` in `deployment_tasks.yaml` record specified * if `type: group` found in `deployment_tasks.yaml` * Warnings: * `tasks.yaml` persist and it is not empty * Warn about experimental task-based orchestrator enabled requirements for Fuel v8.0.0 and no support for Fuel <= v7.0.0. * During validation of Plugin package v4.0.0 * Errors: * `cross-depended-by` and `cross-depends` are found without `version: 2.0.0` * `parameters: strategy: type: parallel|one_by_one` are found without `version: 2.0.0` * Warnings: * `tasks.yaml` will be deprecated in next release and not recommended to use * `groups: [...]` is used with `version: 2.0.0` * Recommend for plugin developer to use package v5.0.0 if tasks `version: 2.0.0` is used --------------- End user impact --------------- None ------------------ Performance impact ------------------ None ----------------- Deployment impact ----------------- None ---------------- Developer impact ---------------- This feature is highly affects Fuel plugins developers. --------------------- Infrastructure impact --------------------- Multi-version plugins support could have some impact on recommended plugins repo structure and package versions management. -------------------- Documentation impact -------------------- Add documentation of fuel plugins format v4.0.0 v5.0.0 according to the Fuel plugins builder examples. -------------- Implementation -------------- Assignee(s) =========== Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up? If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the primary author and contact. Primary assignee: ikutukov@mirantis.com Other contributors: Mandatory design review: bgaifulin@mirantis.com ikalnitsky@mirantis.com Work Items ========== * add v5 support to Nailgun v8.0 and Nailgun v9.0 https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1534235 * Add plugins v5 examples and templates for Fuel Plugin Builder 9.0 https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1534126 * Update plugins v5 validation for Fuel Plugin Builder 9.0 including warnings https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1534126 * Update Nailgun to support node roles tasks * Update Nailgun to support multi-version package or multi-version directives Dependencies ============ None ----------- Testing, QA ----------- * Manual testing * Plugins v5.0 should be tested for Fuel 8.0 with enabled task-based deployment and for Fuel 9.0 with default orchestrator. Also plugins v5.0 should not be enabled for Fuel 8.0 environments with disabled task-based deployment. * `tasks.yaml` file should not affect Fuel 9.0 plugins and induce according warning for fuel plugin builder. * Example v5 plugins for fuel plugin builder should work. * Proper work of plugin validator should be tested. * All version-related Fuel Plugin builder and notifications should work. TODO(ikutukov): add testing points for the multi-version packages when implementation details will be clear. Acceptance criteria =================== * It should be possible to build and install plugins v5 for Fuel 8.0 and 9.0 * Multi-version packages should respect environment version. ---------- References ---------- None",,445,0

We can set the storage and replication addresses differently for each of
the 3 swift-hosts.

swift-storage1 will use the ""swift_storage_address"" and
""swift_replication_address"" values to set it's service and ring IPs.

swift-storage2 will use the default IPs calculated by finding the IP on
the appropriate interfaces (eth2 for storage and eth3 for replication).

swift-storage3 will use the swift_vars.storage_ip and swift_vars.repl_ip
vars to set it's service and ring IPs

This PR makes the gate more efficient by removing swift-storage4.

Those objects are intentionally not integrated into the database code so
far. This is to quicken access to their definitions to implement
push-notifications for networks.

Segments are part of the network object. Since we need to reduce the

side, it should be ok to live without them.

Another database related thing still missing in this patch is lack of
RBAC support for the object. To complete this support,

All the code related to the Hyper-V Neutron Agent and its
Security Groups Driver was fully decomposed into networking-hyperv
in Mitaka.

The only thing that remained was a debtcollector move for the
HyperVSecurityGroupsDriver, in order to prevent deployments from
breaking when upgrading to Mitaka or Newton from older versions.
This will be removed in Ocata.

Change the 'ceilometer_service_names' from a list to a dictionary
mapping of services, groups that install those services. This brings
the method into line with that used in the os_neutron role in order
to implement a more standardised method.

The init tasks have been updated to run once and loop through this
mapping rather than being included multiple times and re-run against
each host. This may potentially reduce role run times.

Currently the reload of upstart/systemd scripts may not happen if
only one script changes as the task uses a loop with only one result
register. This patch implements handlers to reload upstart/systemd
scripts to ensure that this happens when any one of the scripts
change.

The handler to reload the services now only tries to restart the
service if the host is in the group for the service according to the
service group mapping. This allows us to ensure that handler
failures are no longer ignored and that no execution time is wasted
trying to restart services which do not exist on the host.

Finally:
- Common variables shared by each service's template files have
  been updated to use the service namespaced variables.
- Unused handlers have been removed.
- Unused variables have been removed.

There's no real cost to having IPA debug output on, and it helps
operators work out from a KVM what went wrong when things get
exciting. So let's just turn it on by default.

The NS metadata proxy pid cleanup process hunts for and removes
PIDs executing old code by using version tags. Under certain
conditions it's possible for an old PID to have expired before
the cleanup action has run. This change simply wraps the
`pkill` command with a test to ensure the task isn't failing.
Should a PID actually be cleaned up the task will print to stdout
and log using the logger command.

We can set the storage and replication addresses differently for each of
the 3 swift-hosts.

swift-storage1 will use the ""swift_storage_address"" and
""swift_replication_address"" values to set it's service and ring IPs.

swift-storage2 will use the default IPs calculated by finding the IP on
the appropriate interfaces (eth2 for storage and eth3 for replication).

swift-storage3 will use the swift_vars.storage_ip and swift_vars.repl_ip
vars to set it's service and ring IPs

This PR makes the gate more efficient by removing swift-storage4.
