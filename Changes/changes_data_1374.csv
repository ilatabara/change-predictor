If a backup is restored to a volume that is bigger than the
backup itself, which could be the case if --volume-id is
supplied, we need the option to set extraneous extents to zero
i.e. set extents after those from the backup to zero.

Tenant isolation provides protection from most of the potential race conditions between tests outside the same class. But there are still a few of things to watch out for to try to avoid issues when running your tests in parallel. - Resources outside of a tenant scope still have the potential to conflict. This is a larger concern for the admin tests since most resources and actions that require admin privleges are outside of tenants. - Races between methods in the same class are not a problem because parallelization in tempest is at the test class level, but if there is a json and xml version of the same test class there could still be a race between methods. - The rand_name() function from tempest.common.utils.data_utils should be used anywhere a resource is created with a name. Static naming should be avoided to prevent resource conflicts. - If the execution of a set of tests is required to be serialized then locking can be used to perform this. See AggregatesAdminTest in tempest.api.compute.admin for an example of using locking.",,25,0

As part of commit d44b07ea22ecb195b8aa950ebc7b3186442d5d9a,
setup-endpoints was updated to call register-endpoint with empty
passwords if they weren't specified on the command line.  The empty
password causes register-endpoint to generate a random password for
the endpoint.  However, devtest was not updated to create the
passwords before hand for the seed node like is shown for the

I'm not sure if the intent was to continue to have the seed node use
unset passwords or update devtest to set passwords.  This change
updates devtest to use unset passwords, if that's not desired, I can
update it the other way instead.

Note this patch also requires https://review.openstack.org/#/c/46621/

blueprint: configurable-ip-allocation
As first step to make ip allocation configurable, factor out
ip allocation/releasing logic from QauntumDbPluginV2.

The next step will be to add column ip allocation strategy/parameter column
to subnets table.
3rd step will be to implement other ip allocation driver like random, LRA,
and exhaust before repeat
The last step will be documentation.

This patch is needed for EDP purposes and will keep
Vanilla Plugin with the latest stable Hadoop as well

In Hadoop 1.2.x version,  4 level topologies were introduced:
all network, rack, node group (represent Hadoop nodes on the
same compute host in the simplest case) and node.
Usually Hadoop has replication factor 3. In this case
Hadoop placement algorithm is trying to put a HDFS block
in the local node or local node group, second replica
should be placed outside the node group, but on the same rack,
and the last replica outside the initial rack.
Topology is defined by the path to vm e.g.

/datacenter1/rack1/host1/vm1
/datacenter1/rack1/host1/vm2
/datacenter1/rack1/host2/vm1
/datacenter1/rack1/host2/vm2
/datacenter1/rack2/host3/vm1
/datacenter1/rack2/host3/vm2
....

Also, this information will be used for job routing, to place
the mapper as closest as possible to the data.

The periodic task which looks for instances which have been deleted
but are still running at the hypervisor supports a ""reap"" action to
delete them. It does this by calling the _shutdown_instance() method
which as part of its processing will send notification messages.

However, the notification code depends on the instance object
including system metadata information, and the db queries that build
instance objects do not extend the ""read deleted"" filter down to
these queries. This results in an exception in the shutdown code
which in turn prevents the VM from being deleted.

A seperate bug has been submitted to make deleted instance objects
consistent with undeleted ones, which would fix the KeyError.

However the reap code should also not send notification messages.
The instance was deleted some time ago, and so messages will have
been generated then.  Sending new messages for the instance at this
point will confuse any billing and monitoring systems.

In the event the original shudown/delete notifictaions were lost
the absense of ""instance.exists"" messages already addresses this
case.

The group by statistics storage tests don't have any test cases for
timestamp filtering.

The group by statistics API tests already have test cases for
timestamp filtering with the same test database, so these test cases
are simply copied over to the storage tests.

The added test cases are group by

a) single field with start timestamp after all samples
b) single field with end timestamp before all samples
c) single field with start timestamp
d) single field with end timestamp

Currently to determine a user's groups (or vice versa) we do
- 1 lookup for the user.
- 1 lookup for the association table.
- n lookups for the n groups the user has.

The association and groups lookup are replaced with a join query.

NeutronExceptions have a 'message' class attribute that holds the
generic error message template, e.g. ""Network %(network)s not found"",
unfortunately, because the names are the same, it was overshadowing the
actual exception instance 'message', e.g. ""Network 1 not found"", after
translation when the exception was serialized to JSON.

This patch puts the exception's actual message in a new field called
'msg' and overwrites NeutronException unicode() so that 'msg' is used
during serialization and we'll get the correct message on the REST API
response.

Add instance image cache mechanism, when use_linked_clone is enabled,
images downloaded from Glance will be extend to the specified flavor
size and store in image base directory as cache. The instance root disk
will use the cached image files as link clone. If use_linked_clone is
disabled, we will copy the full image from cache to instance directory.

This patch also adds support for ephemeral disk.

When uninstalling grub2, leave all its dependencies
including grub2-tools installed to minimise the number of packages
which need to be installed in the finalise stage.

Since the yum cache is unmounted during finalise, installing
grub2 in finalise is slowed by re-populating the yum cache.

This change copies the grub2 rpm out of the yum cache so it can be installed
from file during finalise.

This should prevent disk becoming full during finalise on Fedora.

The “logtest” directory contains four log files with the following line format.</para> <para> <literallayout>Files: 2010-11-16-21_access.log 2010-11-16-22_access.log 2010-11-15-21_access.log 2010-11-15-22_access.log Log lines: Nov 15 21:53:52 lucid64 proxy-server - 127.0.0.1 15/Nov/2010/22/53/52 DELETE /v1/AUTH_cd4f57824deb4248a533f2c28bf156d3/2eefc05599d44df38a7f18b0b42ffedd HTTP/1.0 204 - \ - test%3Atester%2CAUTH_tkcdab3c6296e249d7b7e2454ee57266ff - - - txaba5984c-aac7-460e-b04b-afc43f0c6571 - 0.0432 </literallayout> </para> <para>The swift tool can easily upload the four log files into a container named “logtest”:</para> <para><screen> <prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>cd logs</userinput> <prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>swift -A http://swift-auth.com:11000/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing upload logtest *.log</userinput> </screen> <programlisting> 2010-11-16-21_access.log2010-11-15-22_access.log </programlisting> Get statistics on the account: <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>swift -A http://swift-auth.com:11000/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing -q stat</userinput></screen> <programlisting> Account: AUTH_cd4f57824deb4248a533f2c28bf156d3Bytes: 5888268 </programlisting> Get statistics on the container: <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>swift -A http://swift-auth.com:11000/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing stat logtest</userinput> </screen><programlisting>Account: AUTH_cd4f57824deb4248a533f2c28bf156d3Write ACL: </programlisting> List all the objects in the container: <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>swift -A http:///swift-auth.com:11000/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing list logtest</userinput></screen><programlisting>2010-11-15-21_access.log2010-11-16-22_access.log</programlisting> </para> <para>The following examples use the -o —output option with (-) to help answer questions about the uploaded log files. The swift command will download an object, stream it to awk to determine the breakdown of requests by return code for everything during 2200 on November 16th, 2010. Based on the log line format column 9 is the type of request and column 12 is the return code. After awk processes the data stream it is piped to sort and then uniq -c to sum up the number of occurrences for each combination of request type and return code.</para> <para><screen> <prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>swift -A http://swift-auth.com:11000/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing download -o - logtest 2010-11-16-22_access.log | awk ‘{ print $9”-“$12}’ | sort | uniq -c</userinput> </screen> <programlisting>805 DELETE-2048 PUT-499</programlisting> </para> <para>This example uses a bash for loop with awk, swift with its -o —output option with a hyphen (-) to find out how many PUT requests are in each log file. First create a list of objects by running swift with the list command on the “logtest” container; then for each item in the list run swift with download -o - then pipe the output into grep to filter the put requests and finally into wc -l to count the lines.</para> <para> <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>for f in `swift -A http://swift-auth.com:11000/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing list logtest` ; \ <programlisting> 2010-11-15-21_access.log - PUTS - 4022010-11-16-22_access.log - PUTS - 910 </programlisting> </para> <para>By adding the -p —prefix option a prefix query is performed on the list to return only the object names that begin with a specific string. Let’s determine out how many PUT requests are in each object with a name beginning with “2010-11-15”. First create a list of objects by running swift with the list command on the “logtest” container with the prefix option -p 2010-11-15. Then on each of item(s) returned run swift with the download -o - then pipe the output to grep and wc as in the previous example. The echo command is added to display the object name.</para> <para> <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>for f in `swift -A http://swift-auth.com:11000/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing list -p 2010-11-15 logtest` ; \ do echo -ne “$f - PUTS - ” ; swift -A http://127.0.0.1:11000/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing download -o - logtest $f | grep PUT | wc -l ; \ <programlisting>2010-11-15-21_access.log - PUTS - 402 2010-11-15-22_access.log - PUTS - 910</programlisting> </para> <para>The swift utility is simple, scalable, flexible and provides useful solutions all of which are core principles of cloud computing; with the -o output option being just one of its many features.</para> </section>",105,103

This also moves heat's logging to work more like the other OpenStack
services, so /var/log/heat will no longer be present.

This port server_test into v3. Add new server_client and
server_actions test for v3 api by inheritance. Also do
some changes in BaseComputeTest and client manager to
support nova v3 tests.

In nova v3 API there is no image API. So use glance
directly and change create_image use servers_client,

Unit test for l3 agent scheduler and dhcp agent scheduler should be

- currently nvp doesn't support both of them, future plugin may not

This change fixes an issue that is most acute in test/dev
environments but that may affect production environments
as well: the presence of DHCP directories that no longer
represent networks that exist in the Neutron DB. This
issue can manifest itself over time if you delete networks
from the Server while the Agent node is down.

Without this fix, at the agent start-up the method
existing_dhcp_networks will return an empty list, and
as a consequence the directories that belong to networks
that have been removed from the server will stay because
the sync logic will not process them as it only looks at
the mismatch between active networks on the agent and
active networks on the server. With the fix instead, we
return *all* existing dhcp networks; if they are meant to
be active, the agent will bring them up, if they no longer
exist on the server, then the agent will dispose of the
resources. The dnsmasq driver will do the right thing when
enabling or disabling the process.

This patchset contributes a message controller for Marconi client. It
implements simple property querying for messages, as well as the
ability to reload these properties as needed (polling?) and delete a
message. It also uses the assumed structure of the HTTPclient that
will form the basis of the connection from the common libraries.

six is used to boost py3k compat.

This also introduces a directory structure for supporting multiple
transports. Instead of having a 'controller' dir, now we have a
'transports/http' and 'transports/zmq'.

If handoffs_first is True, then the object replicator will give
partitions that are not supposed to be on the node priority.

If handoff_delete is set to a number (n), then it will delete a handoff
partition if at least n replicas were successfully replicated

When booting an instance using the new BDMv2 API we can specify to boot
from a volume created from an image on the fly. In this case the API
should pass the image properties to the new instance so it can get some
important parameters that it might specify.

After adding the new BDMv2 API in 13180f76, we introduced a mistake in
the method that gets the image properties (from the boot BDM) if no
image_ref is defined. When the source is an image it will return the
whole image metadata instead of getting just the properties. This
causes that when the source image is an AMI the instance won't have the
ramdisk and kernel properties set and will fail to boot.

This patch fixes the image properties when booting from a volume created
from an image.

This ensure that a VM uuid stays untouched, avoiding potential
confusion when inspecting NVP port tags. This patch also abstracts
the hashing method out by introducing a device_id_to_vm_id method.
Filtering logic is preserved, and a test has been added to ensure

Currently it was logged only when cli subprocess call itself
failed, so there was not enough debug output when asserts/test cases
failed.

Also fixes invalid log.warning on newline at the end of ascii table.

For backport - as stderr was always merged to stdout in grizzly time
 - corresponding parts of the patch were removed.

This option is used to specify the default AZ for the whole service. So when
creating a new volume this value is used to specify the AZ of a volume.

Previously we were overloading the use of the storage_availability_zone option
which is also used to specify what AZ a service belongs to. We still fail back
on the storage_availability_zone when creating a new volume if the
default_availability_zone is not set.

This patch adds the cinder brick library into nova.
It also refactors the kvm libvirt volume driver
to use the new brick connector object.
This also refactors the way we fetch the iscsi
initiator information and the fibre channel
wwns and wwpns.

A follow up patch will include the refactoring of
the kvm libvirt iSCSI volume driver.

Once this lands in Nova, we will push to have brick
accepted into OSLO.

Attaching of a fibre channel LUN to an instance on ESX is enabled
by providing the details of the host's HBA wwnn(s) and wwpn(s) to
cinder. Cinder driver inturn provides the target wwpn and wwnn,
lun id of the target. This is used by the ESX nova driver
to attach the LUN to the instance

This patch addresses the the following points of the blueprint,
1. Enhance the vCenter driver to support FC volume attach to

2. Support HP Cinder 3Par driver

If the instance is hosted in a cluster, then the presentation
of the LUN is done only to the host on which the instance is
hosted.

This patch adds storage queries for traits and
event types. Queries added in this patch set:

 * get_event_types - returns all event_types in
   the database. This is simply a string.
 * get_trait_types - returns all trait_types
   filtered by event_type.
 * get_traits - returns all trait data for an
   event_type, and an optional trait_type name.

In order to accomodate the new trait type table,
the storage model for trait is refactored, and a
new TraitType model is added. This model is necessary
because the api will provide a way to query trait
types without returning all trait data. Without
the TraitType model, there is no good way to return
a list of trait (name, data type) pairs to the api.

This chapter cannot hope to document all of these, but however we do try to introduce the important concepts so that you know where to go digging for more information.</para> <section xml:id=""driver_differences""> <title>Differences between various drivers</title> <para>Many OpenStack projects implement a driver layer, and each of these drivers will implement their own configuration options. For example in OpenStack Compute (Nova), there are various hypervisor drivers implemented -- libvirt, xenserver, hyper-v and vmware for example. Not all of these hypervisor drivers have the same features, and each has different tuning requirements.</para> <note><para>You can see a matrix of the various features in OpenStack Compute (Nova) hypervisor drivers on the OpenStack wiki at <link xlink:href=""https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/HypervisorSupportMatrix"">the Hypervisor support matrix page</link>.</para></note> <para>The point I am trying to make here is that just because an option exists doesn't mean that option is relevant to your driver choices. Normally the documentation should note which drivers the configuration applies to.</para> </section> <section xml:id=""periodic_tasks""> <title>Periodic tasks</title> <para>Another common concept across various OpenStack projects is that of periodic tasks. Pediodic tasks are much like cron jobs on traditional Unix systems, but they are run inside of an OpenStack process. For example, when OpenStack Compute (Nova) needs to work out what images it can remove from its local cache, it runs a periodic task to do this.</para> <para>Periodic tasks are important to understand because of limitations in the threading model that OpenStack uses. OpenStack uses cooperative threading in python, which means that if something long and complicated is running, it will block other tasks inside that process from running unless it voluntarily yields execution to another cooperative thread.</para> <para>A tangible example of this is the nova-compute process. In order to manage the image cache with libvirt, nova-compute has a periodic process which scans the contents of the image cache. Part of this scan is calculating a checksum for each of the images and making sure that checksum matches what nova-compute expects it to be. However, images can be very large and these checksums can take a long time to generate. At one point, before it was reported as a bug and fixed, nova-compute would block on this task and stop responding to RPC requests. This was visible to users as failure of operations such as spawning or deleting instances.</para> <para>The take away from this is if you observe an OpenStack process which appears to ""stop"" for a while and then continue to process normally, you should check that periodic tasks aren't the problem. One way to do this is to disable the periodic tasks by setting their interval to zero. Additionally, you can configure how often these periodic tasks run -- in some cases it might make sense to run them at a different frequency from the default.</para> </section> <section> <title>Specific configuration topics</title> <para>This section covers specific examples of configuration options you might consider tuning. It is by no means an exhaustive list.</para> <section> <title>OpenStack Compute (Nova)</title> <section> <title>Periodic task frequency</title> <para>Before the Grizzly release, the frequency of periodic tasks was specified in seconds between runs. This meant that if the periodic task took 30 minutes to run and the frequency was set to hourly, then the periodic task actually ran every 90 minutes, because the task would wait an hour after running before running again. This changed in Grizzly, and we now time the frequency of periodic tasks from the start of the work the task does. So, our 30 minute periodic task will run every hour, with a 30 minute wait between the end of the first run and the start of the next.</para> </section> </section> </section> </chapter> ",,108,0

Bug 1215872

Add a relationship with eager loading in the Port and Network models,
thus preventing the 'extend' functions from performing extra queries.
This patch also slight alters the methods for processing qos_queue
bindings in order to allow them for populating the qos_queue id in
the response being created.

This might be database transitions, vm modifications, other deep state changes which aren't really accessible from the OpenStack API. These side effects are sometimes important to validate. White box testing is an approach there. In white box testing you are given database access to the environment, and can verify internal record changes after an API call. This is an optional part of testing, and requires extra setup, but can be useful for validating Tempest internals. Why are these tests in tempest? ------------------------------- Especially when it comes to something like VM state changing, which is a coordination of numerous running daemons, and a functioning VM, it's very difficult to get a realistic test like this in unit tests. Scope of these tests -------------------- White box tests should be limitted to tests where black box testing (using the OpenStack API to verify results) isn't sufficient. As these poke at internals of OpenStack, it should also be realized that these tests are very tightly coupled to current implementation of OpenStack. They will need to be maintained agressively to keep up with internals changes in OpenStack projects. Example of a good test ---------------------- Pushing VMs through a series of state transitions, and ensuring along the way the database state transitions match what's expected. ",1,610

For the api tests service tags are only needed if the test method makes an api call (either directly or indirectly through another service) that differs from the parent directory name.

We don't need to update PO files of all languages.
PO files of languages other than English should be update by
importing translations from Transifex.

This commit changes ""run_tests.sh --makemessages"" only updates

This fixes a couple of problems with the returned user object
when the Keystone server when the LDAP Identity backend is
configured and the user_enabled_mask setting is not zero.

First, the returned user had the masked value (e.g., 512) when
a user was created rather than the actual enabled value (true
or false).

Second, the Keystone server was returning the enabled_nomask
attribute in the user entry when users were listed or updated.

This change makes it so that the server returns the enabled
value as a Boolean when a user is created. Also, the
enabled_nomask attribute is not returned when users are
listed or updated.

This patch removes the shadowing of the NeutronException.message
attribute, done by its children exceptions, by using 'msg_fmt' as the
name of the class attribute so we can actually use an exception objects
.message attribute.

Currently:

  >>> class MyException(NeutronException):
  ...     message = 'Foo %s'
  ...     def __init__(self, bar):
  ...         message = self.message % bar
  ...         super(NeutronException, self).__init__(message)
  ...
  >>> MyException('bar').message
  'Foo %s'
  >>> str(MyException('bar'))
  'Foo bar'

whereas, we obviously wanted:

  >>> MyException('bar').message
  'Foo bar'
  >>> str(MyException('bar'))
  'Foo bar'

For more details see: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/37354/

The\nca may be encrypted with a password, if so it will need the ca\npassword to decrypt the key. The key password is passed via the\n-passin argument, if the -passin argument is not provided it will\nprompt for it interactively.\n\nISSUE: The openssl ca command is not passed the key password, if it\ndid it would need to so like this: ""-passin pass:%(ca_password)s"".\nSince the ca_password is not passed to the ca command it\'s not\ndoing anything.\n\nPasswords used by openssl are either prompted for interactively or\nobtained non-interactively via a comman line argument, an environment\nvariable, a file, read from a file descriptor (e.g. pipe) or read from\nstdin.\n\nISSUE: Since OpenStack components are meant to run non-interactively\n(at least not requiring admins to type in passwords at random prompts)\nwe must store the password in the file system, typically inside a\nconfig file. The only thing that protects that password are\nDAC (Discretionary Access Control) commonly known as file\nsystem protections and/or MAC (Mandatory Access Control) typically\nimplemented via SELinux. Since the protection on the key file is not\nfundamentally different than the protection on the file containing the\npassword it\'s dubious as to what extra protection is being provided by\npassword protecting the key. In a properly configured system the same\nprotections should be applied to both the key file and the password\nfile. If an attacker has access to the one of the files he almost\ncertainly has access to the other file. This begs the question as to\nwhat actual protection is being afforded via key passwords. In fact an\nargument can be made that having to carefully protect configuration\nfiles containing passwords is an additional security item which has to\nbe verified, something which adds complexity with marginal\nbenefit. More to the point many admins are not likely to understand\nthe critical importance of protecting a config file, while on the\nother hand the necessity to protect a key file is obvious. Another\njustification for removing the ca pasword is the keystone\nconfiguration documentation (doc/source/configuration.rst) states keys\nprovided by an external source must not be password protected. So if\nexternally provided keys are not password protected they why would\nkeys generated by keystone-manage be password protected? It\'s\ninconsistent.\n\nSummary:\n\nGiven numerous mistakes in using key passwords in the current\nimplementation and the marginal value key password protection afford\nit is recommended to eliminate password protection with the added\nbenefit of reducing the complexity of the system. Less complexity\nusually results in greater security because there are fewer moving\nparts to track and validate. As Bruce Schneier says ""Complexity is the\nworst enemy of security"". The numerous mistakes in utilizing the\nopenssl password options is a testament to the complexity argument\nespecially considering the existing code passed a peer review\nprocess.\n\nChange-Id: Iaeb97f2338c4d3c6e770b410dee8f1b62778b561\nFixes: Bug #1214016\n'}, {'number': 2, 'created': '2013-09-09 16:19:59.000000000', 'files': ['etc/keystone.conf.sample', 'keystone/common/config.py', 'doc/source/configuration.rst', 'keystone/common/openssl.py'], 'web_link': 'https://opendev.org/openstack/keystone/commit/baa57f3efa2c3306b0c100ea95a2bdf935960d2e', 'message': 'Remove CA key password from cert setup\n\nPassword protection in the current implementation is not actually\napplied despite the presence of the ca_password config\noption.

applied despite the presence of the ca_password config

Misuse of assertTrue in places where assertEqual should be used.

If assertTrue is used instead of assertEquals, the test will always pass
if the first argument's boolean cast is True. The second argument
passed to assertTrue() will be regarded as the error message
when the assertion fails. Using assertEqual will actually check
if two arguments are same value.

'devtest.md' is duplicated in the CI infrastructure. By using the well
known pattern of testable-documentation / documented tests we can have
cake and eat it too: a clear story that helps users understand whats
going on, and a script that can test our workflow end to end.

This will be a multi-part story to get the devtest aspects of toci

You can run NAT, or not, as you ## choose. This is how we connect to it to run scripts etc - though you can ## equally log in on its console if you like. ## ## We use flat networking with all machines on one broadcast domain for dev-test. ## ## The eth1 of your seed instance should be connected to your bare metal cloud ## LAN. The seed VM uses the rfc5735 TEST-NET-1 range - 192.0.2.0/24 for ## bringing up nodes, and does its own DHCP etc, so do not connect it to a network ## shared with other DHCP servers or the like. The instructions in this document ## create a bridge device ('brbm') on your machine to emulate this with virtual ## machine 'bare metal' nodes. ## ## ## NOTE: We recommend using an apt/HTTP proxy and setting the http_proxy ## environment variable accordingly in order to speed up the image build ## times. See footnote [3] to set up Squid proxy. ## ## NOTE: Likewise, setup a pypi mirror and use the pypi element, or use the ## pip-cache element. (See diskimage-builder documentation for both of ## these). Add the relevant element name to the disk-image-builder and ## boot-seed-vm script invocations. ## ## NOTE: The CPU architecture specified in several places must be consistent. ## The examples here use 32-bit arch for the reduced memory footprint. If ## you are running on real hardware, or want to test with 64-bit arch, ## replace i386 => amd64 and i686 => x86_64 in all the commands below. You ## will of course need amd64 capable hardware to do this. ## ## Detailed instructions ## --------------------- ## ## __(Note: all of the following commands should be run on your host machine, not inside the seed VM)__ ## ## 1. Before you start, check to see that your machine supports hardware ## virtualization, otherwise performance of the test environment will be poor. ## We are currently bringing up an LXC based alternative testing story, which ## will mitigate this, thoug the deployed instances will still be full virtual ## machines and so performance will be significantly less there without ## hardware virtualization. ## ## 1. Also check ssh server is running on the host machine and port 22 is open for ## connections from virbr0 - VirtPowerManager will boot VMs by sshing into the ## host machine and issuing libvirt/virsh commands. The user these instructions ## use is your own, but you can also setup a dedicated user if you choose. ## ## 1. The devtest scripts require access to the libvirt system URI. ## If running against a different libvirt URI you may encounter errors. ## Export LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI to prevent devtest using qemu:///system ## Check that the default libvirt connection for your user is qemu:///system. ## If it is not, set an environment variable to configure the connection. ## This configuration is necessary for consistency, as later steps assume ## qemu:///system is being used. ## # Check the output of ""virsh uri"" if [ ""$(virsh uri)"" != ""qemu:///system"" ]; then export LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI=qemu:///system fi ## 1. Choose a base location to put all of the source code. mkdir ~/tripleo # exports are ephemeral - new shell sessions, or reboots, and you need # to redo them. export TRIPLEO_ROOT=~/tripleo cd $TRIPLEO_ROOT 1. git clone this repository to your local machine. git clone https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-incubator.git 1. Nova tools get installed in $TRIPLEO_ROOT/tripleo-incubator/scripts - you need to add that to the PATH. export PATH=$PATH:$TRIPLEO_ROOT/tripleo-incubator/scripts 1. Set HW resources for VMs used as 'baremetal' nodes. NODE_CPU is cpu count, NODE_MEM is memory (MB), NODE_DISK is disk size (GB), NODE_ARCH is architecture (i386, amd64). NODE_ARCH is used also for the seed VM. A note on memory sizing: TripleO images in raw form are currently ~2.7Gb, which means that a tight node will end up with a thrashing page cache during glance -> local + local -> raw operations. This significantly impairs performance. Of the four minimum VMs for TripleO simulation, two are nova baremetal nodes (seed an undercloud) and these need to be 2G or larger. The hypervisor host in the overcloud also needs to be a decent size or it cannot host more than one VM. 32bit VMs: export NODE_CPU=1 NODE_MEM=2048 NODE_DISK=10 NODE_ARCH=i386 For 64bit it is better to create VMs with more memory and storage because of increased memory footprint: export NODE_CPU=1 NODE_MEM=2048 NODE_DISK=15 NODE_ARCH=amd64 1. Ensure dependencies are installed and required virsh configuration is performed: install-dependencies 1. Clone/update the other needed tools which are not available as packages. pull-tools 1. You need to make the tripleo image elements accessible to diskimage-builder: export ELEMENTS_PATH=$TRIPLEO_ROOT/tripleo-image-elements/elements 1. Configure a network for your test environment. This configures an openvswitch bridge and teaches libvirt about it. setup-network 1. Create a deployment ramdisk + kernel. These are used by the seed cloud and the undercloud for deployment to bare metal. $TRIPLEO_ROOT/diskimage-builder/bin/ramdisk-image-create -a $NODE_ARCH \ ubuntu deploy -o deploy-ramdisk 1. Create and start your seed VM. This script invokes diskimage-builder with suitable paths and options to create and start a VM that contains an all-in-one OpenStack cloud with the baremetal driver enabled, and preconfigures it for a development environment. cd $TRIPLEO_ROOT/tripleo-image-elements/elements/seed-stack-config sed -i ""s/\""user\"": \""stack\"",/\""user\"": \""`whoami`\"",/"" config.json # If you use 64bit VMs (NODE_ARCH=amd64), update also architecture. sed -i ""s/\""arch\"": \""i386\"",/\""arch\"": \""$NODE_ARCH\"",/"" config.json cd $TRIPLEO_ROOT boot-seed-vm -a $NODE_ARCH boot-seed-vm will start a VM and copy your SSH pub key into the VM so that you can log into it with 'ssh root@192.0.2.1'. The IP address of the VM is printed out at the end of boot-elements, or you can use the get-vm-ip script: export SEED_IP=`get-vm-ip seed` 1. Add a route to the baremetal bridge via the seed node (we do this so that your host is isolated from the networking of the test environment. # These are not persistent, if you reboot, re-run them. sudo ip route del 192.0.2.0/24 dev virbr0 || true sudo ip route add 192.0.2.0/24 dev virbr0 via $SEED_IP 1. Mask the SEED_IP out of your proxy settings export no_proxy=$no_proxy,192.0.2.1,$SEED_IP 1.

Footnotes ========= * [1] Customize a downloaded seed image. If you downloaded your seed VM image, you may need to configure it. Setup a network proxy, if you have one (e.g. 192.168.2.1 port 8080) # Run within the image! echo << EOF >> ~/.profile export no_proxy=192.0.2.1 export http_proxy=http://192.168.2.1:8080/ EOF Add an ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. The image rejects password authentication for security, so you will need to ssh out from the VM console. Even if you don't copy your authorized_keys in, you will still need to ensure that /home/stack/.ssh/authorized_keys on your seed node has some kind of public SSH key in it, or the openstack configuration scripts will error. You can log into the console using the username 'stack' password 'stack'. * [2] Requirements for the ""baremetal node"" VMs If you don't use bm_poseur, but want to create your own VMs, here are some suggestions for what they should look like. - each VM should have 1 NIC - eth0 should be on brbm - record the MAC addresses for the NIC of each VM. - give each VM no less than 2GB of disk, and ideally give them more than BM_FLAVOR_ROOT_DISK, which defaults to 2GB - 1GB RAM is probably enough (512MB is not enough to run an all-in-one OpenStack), and 768M isn't enough to do repeated deploys with. - if using KVM, specify that you will install the virtual machine via PXE. This will avoid KVM prompting for a disk image or installation media. * [3] Setting Up Squid Proxy - Install squid proxy: `apt-get install squid` - Set `/etc/squid3/squid.conf` to the following: <pre><code> acl manager proto cache_object acl localhost src 127.0.0.1/32 ::1 acl to_localhost dst 127.0.0.0/8 0.0.0.0/32 ::1 acl localnet src 10.0.0.0/8 # RFC1918 possible internal network acl localnet src 172.16.0.0/12 # RFC1918 possible internal network acl localnet src 192.168.0.0/16 # RFC1918 possible internal network acl SSL_ports port 443 acl Safe_ports port 80 # http acl Safe_ports port 21 # ftp acl Safe_ports port 443 # https acl Safe_ports port 70 # gopher acl Safe_ports port 210 # wais acl Safe_ports port 1025-65535 # unregistered ports acl Safe_ports port 280 # http-mgmt acl Safe_ports port 488 # gss-http acl Safe_ports port 591 # filemaker acl Safe_ports port 777 # multiling http acl CONNECT method CONNECT http_access allow manager localhost http_access deny manager http_access deny !Safe_ports http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports http_access allow localnet http_access allow localhost http_access deny all http_port 3128 cache_dir aufs /var/spool/squid3 5000 24 256 maximum_object_size 1024 MB coredump_dir /var/spool/squid3 refresh_pattern ^ftp: 1440 20% 10080 refresh_pattern ^gopher: 1440 0% 1440 refresh_pattern -i (/cgi-bin/|\?) 0 0% 0 refresh_pattern (Release|Packages(.gz)*)$ 0 20% 2880 refresh_pattern . 0 20% 4320 refresh_all_ims on </pre></code> - Restart squid: `sudo service squid3 restart` - Set http_proxy environment variable: `http_proxy=http://your_ip_or_localhost:3128/` ### --end ",,550,0

The path //v1/account does not denote any Swift resource. More
importantly, if you call swift.common.utils.split_path() on it (as the

Since it's a bad path, it doesn't refer to any Swift resource, so

Add 'project_id=None' optional argument in QUOTAS related methods.

There are two problems when admin deletes volumes of common user
before fixing this bug:
Firstly, It will get tenant quotas using context.project_id which
results in getting admin's quotas not common user's.
Secondly, It will also get wrong quota usages using context.project_id
when updating common user's quota_usages.

So we could pass into QUOTAS related methods an optional argument to
specify the tenant ID to be affected. And if it's not set, then we
default to drawing the tenant ID from the context.

When the driver copy_image_to_volume fails it can
at the current time raise more than just CinderException
as its root exception type. This causes rescheduling due
to the blacklisted exception list that is used to determine
if a exception is 'bad enough' to trigger rescheduling or
should the volume creation action just set the volume to
error state.

To avoid the situation where this would cause a rescheduling
we should make sure (for now) that any exception that is
emitted on copying an image to a volume is translated
into a image copy failure and reraised.
