We have too many things to maintain, too few people to maintain and too
less sense not to rely on possible automations.
Basic idea of this change is to kick off with auto-generation of certain
parts of code where it is possible and makes sense to make out lives
easier. This may not always sound like a great idea just to generate
code instead of having required interfaces, but there are too many
places where lot of customizations are necessary and would kill any
attempt of generalization. So instead let us first generate code and
allow human to adapt it where it is necessary.

With this change a submodule ""codegenerator"" is being added with
intention to be invoked manually by a human once there are some changes
in the resources. At the moment it can be invoked as `python
codegenerator/generator.py --module openstack.identity.v3.project
--class-name Project --target osc --work-dir tmp` and let code appear in
tmp dir.

Since we do this it is possible and makes sense to adapt basic resource
class with some additional properties so that handling of microversions
can be easier (generate MV handling logic where attrs appear only in
certain versions).

The object expirer can be configured to delay the reaping of
objects from disk after their expiration time using account
and container level delay_reaping values. The delay_reaping
value of accounts and containers in seconds is configured in
the object server config. The object expirer references these
configured values to only reap objects from specified accounts
and containers after their corresponding delays.

The goal of the delay_reaping feature is to prevent accidental or
premature data loss if an object marked for deletion with the
'x-delete-at' feature should not be reaped immediately, for
whatever reason.

Configuring the delay_reaping value at a granular account and
container level is beneficial for being able to keep storage
capacity consumption in control while maintaining a desired
data recovery window.

This patch also adds a sample configuration, documentation, and
tests for bad configurations and grace period functionality.

As of now, concurrent migration of instances with same multiattach
volume fails on cinder's attachment_create method.

The reason for the failure of vm migration is that the multiattach
volume status changes to 'attaching' in cinder's attachment_update
method on destination node. At this time, when another vm migration
calls cinder's attachment_create method on source node, it sees
volume status is 'attaching', which leads to attachment_create failure.

This change adds a retry mechanism in cinder API calls
attachment_create method.

Admins are allowed to delete keypairs belonging to another user by
passing the 'user_id' query string parameter, for example:

  DELETE /keypairs/{keypair}?user_id=foo

Unfortunately while we were passing through a 'user_id' argument to the
underlying 'openstack.proxy.Proxy._delete' call, this was being used to
populate the 'user_id' body parameter of the 'Keypair' resource as
opposed to the query string parameter. We can't easily change this
because a number of calls to this function involve nested resources, for
example 'openstack.image.v2._proxy.Proxy.remove_member', which must
actually pass the arguments through to the 'Resource'.

Resolve this by adding a 'param' argument to the underlying
'openstack.proxy.Proxy._delete' API, which can be used to pass through
the additional query string parameters to the delete call.

Shard allocation is disabled at the start of the OpenSearch upgrade
task. This is set as a transient setting, meaning it will be removed
once the containers are restarted. However, if there is not change in
the OpenSearch container it will not be restarted so the cluster is left
in a broken state: unable to allocate shards.

This feature is supported by cloud-init https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/datasources/openstack.html#vendor-data but not possible to use with current DynamicJSON vendor data implementation. Have to be implemented for open source project to allow vendors store cloud-config in Consul Key-Value in easy way https://github.com/ib-systems/openstack-consul-dynamic-vendordata There is old abandoned issue: [1](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1841104) Use Cases --------- Providing cloud-config via vendor data could be used to update packages or to install/upgrade and not to use user-data for this to let user customize generic instances with his own settings. While developing https://github.com/ib-systems/openstack-consul-dynamic-vendordata observed that current implementation doesn't allow to provide cloud-config via vendor data. Proposed change =============== I propose to let vendors define cloud-init specific vendor data source like ``` vendordata_dynamic_targets = 'cloud-init@http://10.10.10.10:8000/ocdv' ``` to provide cloud-init as expected format to cloud-init. Following this way vendor need to return single-lined #cloud-config to get it work. Additional check at DynamicJSON provider is required [here](https://opendev.org/openstack/nova/src/branch/master/nova/api/metadata/vendordata_dynamic.py#L95) ``` if service_name == ""cloud-init"": return res.text if res and res.text: # TODO(mikal): Use the Cache-Control response header to do some # sensible form of caching here. return jsonutils.loads(res.text) ``` Alternatives ------------ None Data model impact ----------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Security impact --------------- None Notifications impact -------------------- None Other end user impact --------------------- None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- This have to be explicitly configured by cloud operator for example ``` vendordata_dynamic_targets = 'cloud-init@http://10.10.10.10:8000/ocdv' ``` Developer impact ---------------- None Upgrade impact -------------- None Implementation ============== Assignee(s) ----------- Primary assignee: https://launchpad.net/~iliabaikov Other contributors: None Feature Liaison --------------- Liaison Needed .. _`nova core team`: https://review.opendev.org/#/admin/groups/25,members Work Items ---------- - Create patch that handle `cloud-init` service name and bypass json parse stage; - Look on members review to add fixes if needed; - Merge to other releases; Dependencies ============ This feature doesn't require new library or any dependencies. https://github.com/ib-systems/openstack-consul-dynamic-vendordata depends on dynamic vendor data implementation. This is open source project that allow vendors to provide cloud-config via vendor-data using Consul Key-Value feature. This is very useful in case operator working with a lot of geographically distributed clouds along with a distributed Consul cluster used by cloud management tools for example billing software. Testing ======= Since this change could be ""2 lines"" hardcoded no tests needed, but i'm ready to create one if needed. Documentation Impact ==================== https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/vendordata.html We could add paragraph that in case operator would like to provide cloud-config over dynamic vendor data he need to configure specific service like ""cloud-init@controller:8000/ocdv"" References ========== - [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1841104](Old issue that been abandoned) [https://github.com/ib-systems/openstack-consul-dynamic-vendordata](OpenStack Consul dynamic vendor data) project to let operator manage vendor-data using Consul Key-Value feature.

Before this patch one could only handle one libvirt

Charm instances where the release is > zed does not work using the
default_get_charm_instance. The keys stored in the _releases dictionary
are sorted in their alphabetical sorting order, thus causing releases
such as Bobcat to be treated as older releases than Zed.

This change causes the release names to be sorted using the
CompareOpenStackReleases object from the charmhelpers library. This will
ensure that the release names are sorted according the release order
rather than the alphabetical name.

Changes in oslo.messaging for 2023.1 exposed a known race
condition in RabbitMQ when dealing with non-HA classic queues.
When a RMQ cluster member is taken down, clients failing over
to other members may erroneously be told a queue exists when it
is in the process of being deleted. This can cause them to
permanently sit waiting for messages from a queue that no longer
exists until their services are restarted.

Making the reply queues HA resolves this issue, at the expense
of a x3 increase in reply queues across the cluster. My
assumption is that reply queues were previously excluded from HA
policy as a performance gain given their link to the number of
compute nodes in an OpenStack deployment.

syntax which breaks Python releases before 3.10. Unfortunately, for
2024.1 we commit to supporting Python back to 3.8.

Specifically, you receive this error message if you run pep8:

pep8 Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 410 source files)

I asked some buddies, and we're fairly sure that this line would
crash the runtime on Python 3.8, because its a syntax error.

So instead, let's use typing syntax compatible with other pythons.

In advertise_route_via_bgp_speaker() a check for the matching
ip_version was missing, leading to neutron-dynamic-routing trying
to announce prefixes with mixed IP versions in the CIDR route and
next-hop.

This type of advertisement makes no sense because the IP version of

Fix a potential race condition, the member batch update API call
computes a delta between the current state of the members in the DB and
the members in the requests. But it fetches the members from the DB
before locking the load balancer, it means that another Octavia service
may still update the list of members, then the computation of the
changes may be incorrect.

The list of members is now queried in the locked section.

In DVR mode, vlan bridges could never know the destination
MAC address if it never learnt. This patch adds a mapping
for physical bridges which has items like:
{br-vlan: port1, br-phy: port2}.
Then if packets come from br-int, it will direct output to
these physical port.

Known issue: for some clouds, they may have settings like
this:

   br-vlan -> port1
   |
   port2
the br-vlan has multiple physical ports. This config option
will not cover this approach. However, this configuration is
rare.

And because of such change, the source MAC address will not
be learnt by br-vlan any more. So, we adds ingress direct
flows for incoming traffics.

Furthermore, we directly drop the mutilcast packets from
HA networks.

After first iteration, neutron ovs agent was releasing the vlan hints
back into available vlan.

This could be an issue if neutron agent failed to configure a device
during that first loop.

Example of failure: a RPC call like get_device_details.

When such failure occur, the vlan is not removed from local_vlan_hints
when configuring the device, but the hint is anyway restored in
available vlans at the end of the iteration.

In such situation, a new port can be plugged into br-int reusing a vlan
that is still used by a previous port.

Not disposing the local_vlan_hints after first iteration allow neutron
to keep looking into the hints on next iteration, until it succeed.

Anyway, having a local_vlan_hints not empty after an iteration is an
error and should be logged so operator can eventually fix ovs manually
on some edge cases.

This patch removes DEFAULT_DEVICE_OWNER from the NO_PBLOCKS_TYPES.

After that, metadata agent has no other functionalities. In large-scale scenarios, a large number of deployed metadata agents will cause a waste of resources for hosts and message queue. Because metadata agents will start tons of external processes based on the number of users' resources, report state to Neutron server for keepalive. We are going to overcome this. This spec describes how to implement an agent extension for Neutron openvswitch agent to make the metadata datapath distributed. Problem Description =================== How many metadata-agent should run for a large scale cloud deployment? There is no exact answer to this question. Cloud operators may setup metadata agent to all hosts, something like DHCP agent. Config drive [1]_ can be an alternative for clouds to supply metadata for VMs. But there are some limitations and security problem for config drive. For instance, if you set config drive to use local disk, the live migration may not be available. Config drive uses extra storage device and mounting it inside VMs. Can not change userdata online for users specific scripts. The security issue is that because the mounting FS can be access by all users, if the metadata includes root password or key, the password and the key can be access by none root users. If you are running Neutron agents, there is no alternative to replace metadata agent for cloud deployments. As we can see, the metadata datapath is very long via many devices, namespaces and agents. One metadata path goes down, such as agent down or external process die, will not only influence the host, but also all related hosts that will boot new VMs on. Proposed Change =============== Adds an agent extension for Neutron openvswitch agent to make the metadata datapath distributed. .. note:: This extension is only for openvswitch agent, other mechanism drivers will not be considered, because this new extension will rely on the openflow protocol and principle. Solution Proposed ----------------- Metadata Special purpose IP and MAC *********************************** Each VM in one host will generate a Meta IP + MAC pair which is unique among VMs on host. The agent extension will do the generation work when handle port in the first time, and store the Meta IP + MAC to ovsdb. When ovs-agent is restarting, handle_port funtion will try to read the ovsdb first to reload the Meta IP + MAC, if not exist, re-generate. During the agent extension initialization, it will add a internal port named ""tap-meta"" to the ovs-bridge br-meta. This tap device will have a Meta Gateway MAC + IP. Meatadata data piplines *********************** TCP Egress ~~~~~~~~~~ HTTP request packets from VM direct to br-met, and change IP headers to tap-meta, add HTTP headers in host haproxy then goto nova-metadata API.

Map 'ipip' to use the string 'ipencap' so the
IptablesFirewallDriver class in neutron works correctly.
Once neutron-lib is bumped this can be removed.

Add tests for IP protocol 'ipip', '4' and '94' to make
sure the IptablesFirewallDriver class in neutron treats
them correctly.

Long description below.

This is one of those confusing edge cases and I think
Linux is conspiring against us. Let me explain.

1) neutron-lib does correctly define the protocol name 'ipip' as 4.

2) The linux kernel uses the same in in.h:

 IPPROTO_IPIP = 4
 IPPROTO_BEETPH = 94 (?)

3) iptables maps 'ipip' to 94 and 'ipencap' to 4.

 # for num in {0..255}; do iptables -A INPUT -p $num; done
 # iptables-save | grep -E 'ipip|ipencap'
 -A INPUT -p ipencap
 -A INPUT -p ipip

4) /etc/protocols does the same as iptables:

 grep -E 'ipencap|ipip' /etc/protocols
 ipencap 4 IP-ENCAP # IP encapsulated in IP (officially ``IP'')
 ipip 94 IPIP # IP-within-IP Encapsulation Protocol

5) getprotoby{name|number} does what /etc/protocols does:

 $ getprotobyname ipip
 struct protoent: (0x7fbbbcca9c60)
   p_name ipip
   p_aliases IPIP
   p_proto 94

 $ getprotobynumber 4
 struct protoent: (0x7fc51ad86be0)
   p_name ipencap
   p_aliases IP-ENCAP
   p_proto 4

Neutron actually builds a mapping based on the getprotoby*
calls, so in the iptables case it winds-up doing the wrong
thing.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================================= Keystone identity mapping to support project definition as a JSON ================================================================= This spec adds support for project definition as a JSON in Keystone identity federation attribute mapping schema This spec depends on https://review.opendev.org/#/c/748042/, which is the proposal that enhances the identity mapping schema management. Therefore, we first need to get that reviewed and merged. Problem Description =================== Currently, the project assignment via the federated identity mapping is rather static. This happens because of the find/replace mechanism that we have in place there. Therefore, if the IdP provider generates an attribute that contains a JSON with project definitions, we are not able to handle it in Keystone. Proposed Change =============== This PR introduces a new property in the federated identity mapping schema called `projects_json`. In the schema, this property will accept a JSON string, that defines all of the projects and their specific roles that the user must receive when login-in to the OpenStack platform. Moreover, when using this extension, roles (assigned to projects) are added and removed on the fly. The extension is quite straight forward. We created a new ``schema_version`` (1.2). This new version enables the handling of `project_json` in the attribute mapping. Furthermore, we added code to handle the addition of extra roles for projects and removal of roles that are present in OpenStack, but are not in the IdP data. This is a mechanism to make the state of the OpenStack federated user consistent with the Identity provider user attributes. Attribute mapping schema ------------------------ Adding the `project_json` attribute: .. code-block:: python IDP_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING_SCHEMA_1_2 = copy.deepcopy( IDP_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING_SCHEMA_1_1) IDP_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING_SCHEMA_1_2['properties']['rules']['items']['properties'][ 'local']['items']['properties']['projects_json'] = {""type"": ""string""} By adding ``projects_json`` as a ``string``, we enable operators to use attributes in the IdP, that are a Json Strings which define the projects where the users must be placed in. Moreover, This JSON is then validated against the project definition. The new option will be handled in version ``1.2`` of the attribute mapping schema.

The list of users assigned to a project becomes invisible when a domain context
is set in Horizon. If a domain context is set, the user list call should
provide a list of users within the specified domain context, rather than users
within the user's own domain.

Groups tab of project also has the same problem.

The list of users assigned to a project becomes invisible when a domain context
is set in Horizon. If a domain context is set, the user list call should
provide a list of users within the specified domain context, rather than users
within the user's own domain.

Groups tab of project also has the same problem.

For example: # Initialize connection from a clouds.yaml by passing a cloud name conn_from_cloud_name = openstack.connect(cloud='mordred') # Initialize connection from a clouds.yaml using the OS_CLOUD envvar conn_from_os_cloud = openstack.connect() # Initialize connection from environment variables conn_from_env_vars = openstack.connect(cloud='envvars') .. note:: How this is all achieved is described in more detail `below <openstack.config>`__. .. rubric:: The cloud layer openstacksdk consists of four layers which all build on top of each other. The highest level layer is the *cloud* layer. Cloud layer methods are available via the top level ``Connection`` object returned by ``openstack.connect``. For example:The cloud layer is based on logical operations that can potentially touch multiple services. The benefit of this layer is mostly seen in more complicated operations that take multiple steps and where the steps vary across providers. For example:.. rubric:: The proxy layer The next layer is the *proxy* layer. Most users will make use of this layer. The proxy layer is service-specific, so methods will be available under service-specific connection attributes of the ``Connection`` object such as ``compute``, ``block_storage``, ``image`` etc. For example: .. code-block:: python import openstack # Initialize and turn on debug logging openstack.enable_logging(debug=True) # Initialize connection conn = openstack.connect(cloud='mordred') # List the servers for server in conn.compute.servers(): print(server.to_dict()) .. note:: A list of supported services is given `below <supported-services>`__. .. rubric:: The resource layer Below this there is the *resource* layer. This provides support for the basic CRUD operations supported by REST APIs and is the base building block for the other layers. You typically will not need to use this directly but it can be helpful for operations where you already have a ``Resource`` object to hand. For example:.. rubric:: The raw HTTP layer Finally, there is the *raw HTTP* layer. This exposes raw HTTP semantics and is effectively a wrapper around the `requests`__ API with added smarts to handle stuff like authentication and version management. As such, you can use the ``requests`` API methods you know and love, like ``get``, ``post`` and ``put``, and expect to receive a ``requests.Response`` object in response (unlike the other layers, which mostly all return objects that subclass ``openstack.resource.Resource``). Like the *resource* layer, you will typically not need to use this directly but it can be helpful to interact with APIs that have not or will not be supported by openstacksdk. For example: .. code-block:: python import openstack # Initialize and turn on debug logging openstack.enable_logging(debug=True) # Initialize connection conn = openstack.connect(cloud='mordred') # List servers for server in openstack.compute.get('/servers').json(): print(server) .. __: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ .. _supported-services: .. __: https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator/openstack-components#openstack-services ","openstacksdk consists of three layers. Most users will make use of the *proxy* layer. Using the above ``clouds.yaml``, consider listing servers: # Initialize and turn on debug logging openstack.enable_logging(debug=True) # Initialize connection conn = openstack.connect(cloud='mordred') # List the servers for server in conn.compute.servers(): print(server.to_dict()) openstacksdk also contains a higher-level *cloud* layer based on logical operations:The benefit of this layer is mostly seen in more complicated operations that take multiple steps and where the steps vary across providers. For example:Finally, there is the low-level *resource* layer. This provides support for the basic CRUD operations supported by REST APIs and is the base building block for the other layers. You typically will not need to use this directly:.. __: https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator/openstack-components#openstack-services ",95,18

iptables-save uses a system-dependent value, usually that
found in /etc/protocols, when 'ipip' is given as the
security group protocol. The intent is to always use the
string value for IP protocol '4', as iptables-save has no
'-n' flag to print values numerically.

This updates a previous change (793dfb04d) that hard-coded
that string to 'ipencap', which broke CentOS/Fedora, which
uses 'ipv4'.

For this reason we cannot hard-code anything in neutron-lib,
this needs to be added dynamically, so this one-line change
needs to stay here, and effectively closes the bug.

Map 'ipip' to use the string 'ipencap' so the
IptablesFirewallDriver class in neutron works correctly.
Once neutron-lib is bumped this can be removed.

Add tests for IP protocol 'ipip', '4' and '94' to make
sure the IptablesFirewallDriver class in neutron treats
them correctly.

Long description below.

This is one of those confusing edge cases and I think
Linux is conspiring against us. Let me explain.

1) neutron-lib does correctly define the protocol name 'ipip' as 4.

2) The linux kernel uses the same in in.h:

 IPPROTO_IPIP = 4
 IPPROTO_BEETPH = 94 (?)

3) iptables maps 'ipip' to 94 and 'ipencap' to 4.

 # for num in {0..255}; do iptables -A INPUT -p $num; done
 # iptables-save | grep -E 'ipip|ipencap'
 -A INPUT -p ipencap
 -A INPUT -p ipip

4) /etc/protocols does the same as iptables:

 grep -E 'ipencap|ipip' /etc/protocols
 ipencap 4 IP-ENCAP # IP encapsulated in IP (officially ``IP'')
 ipip 94 IPIP # IP-within-IP Encapsulation Protocol

5) getprotoby{name|number} does what /etc/protocols does:

 $ getprotobyname ipip
 struct protoent: (0x7fbbbcca9c60)
   p_name ipip
   p_aliases IPIP
   p_proto 94

 $ getprotobynumber 4
 struct protoent: (0x7fc51ad86be0)
   p_name ipencap
   p_aliases IP-ENCAP
   p_proto 4

Neutron actually builds a mapping based on the getprotoby*
calls, so in the iptables case it winds-up doing the wrong
thing.

When creating a large volume(1000GB) from a backup,
cinder-backup service no longer send heartbeat to
cinder-scheduler in a period of time. Further debug
shows the backup restore process hangs at librbd
diff_iterate function when it tries to calculate
whether the given rbd volume has extents.

librbd diff_iterate function may take some time depending
on rbd image size, thus blocking cinder-backup service.

This patch moves diff_iterate call to a separate python
thread which doesn't block eventlet loop.

Previously there are a lot of warning messages of setuptools
in the log files of tox jobs. This is mainly caused by test
samples because these are in python codes directories.

This patch moves test samples from under
{heat-translator_root}/translator/tests to under
{heat-translator_root}/samples/tests.

This patch also contains the following changes:
* Remove ""skipsdist = True"" from tox.ini
* Fixed usage.rst command example.
* Changeing unit tests that reference external URL to use mock

Previously there are a lot of warning messages of setuptools
in the log files of tox jobs. This is mainly caused by test
samples because these are in python codes directories.

This patch moves test samples from under
{heat-translator_root}/translator/tests to under
{heat-translator_root}/samples/tests.

This patch also contains the following changes:
* Remove ""skipsdist = True"" from tox.ini
* Fixed usage.rst command example.
* Changeing unit tests that reference external URL to use mock

There was empty space in the top left corner,
due to removal of panels during the porting process from the old dashboards.
This expands the top row to fill the full width, removing the empty space.

Also update the y coordinates of all the other panels,
since a horizontal panel was also removed in the porting process.
This didn't cause empty space, but better to update to be accurate.

In the 'SbGlobalUpdateEvent' the metadata agent updates the
chassis only once regardless of whether it fails or not.
If it fails twice within the 'agent_down_time' window, it may
be considered as down.

To address this issue, implement a retry mechanism if
updating the chassis fails.

Share network subnets were not checking for the existence of share
groups while processing a delete request. Then, if a share network
had a share server that was tied to a share group, it would end up
deleting the share server, leaving the share group orphan. When we
triggered the deletion of the share group, it would fail, as the
share server was not known to Manila anymore.

Fix that issue by adding an extra validation step during the share
network subnet delete API.

The current implementation of the `_full_restore` method in the Ceph
backup driver is causing restoration to fail when restoring to another
volume type. This is because the method generates an incorrect image
name in the Ceph pool, resulting in the error message:

```
rbd.ImageNotFound: [errno 2] error opening image
b'volume-a91c11af-1147-4ac7-a5ce-61676736e076.backup.base' at snapshot
None.
```
Originally, the format `volume-<vol-uuid>.backup-<backup-uuid>` was used
for every backup created on the Ceph pool. However, after the change introduced in commit Ia08c252d747148e624f8d9e8b0e43f94773421e0, the
base name format was altered to volume-<uuid>.backup.base when
creating backups from Cinder snapshots.

This patch modifies the current if statement in _full_restore() to check
for the presence of a snapshot_id attribute in the backup. If the
attribute exists, the old base name format is used; otherwise, the new
format is applied. The if block statement in _full_restore() should now
match the format generated by the _full_backup() method.

Additionally, src_snap is activated when the destination volume is RBD
or if the backup is incremental. Currently, the Ceph backup driver only
supports incremental RBD backups, so incremental backups from non-RBD
volumes are not permitted.

NOTE: This patch primarily mirrors the modifications in
Ia08c252d747148e624f8d9e8b0e43f94773421e0, addressing it as a partial

backup restore operations, which should be considered to fully resolve the bug. These two should be squashed and backported together for

There might be scenarios where a very old backup, created from a Cinder
snapshot, was not handled correctly by my previous patch.

This new patch addresses this corner case by adding a fallback
mechanism.

In Cinder, the base name of the backup volume is generated based either
on the volume id alone or a combination of the volume id and backup id.
Two different scenarios are considered here, each corresponding to a
different base name format:

(1)
If the backup was made from a volume snapshot, the older base name
format is used: volume-<vol-uuid>.backup.base.

(2)
If the backup wasn't made from a snapshot, a newer base name format is
used: volume-<vol-uuid>.backup-<backup-uuid>.

In both cases, the function attempts to restore the volume from a backup
image by looking for it under the base name. If the image is not found
(i.e., rbd.ImageNotFound), an error message is logged, and then the
function attempts to retrieve the backup volume under the alternative
base name. This is done because it's possible that the backup volume was
created using a different format than the one initially tried.

In other words, the check for another base name serves as a fallback
mechanism, which is used when the backup image is not found under the
expected name. The primary reason behind having two different base name
formats is likely due to a change in the naming convention at some point
in the history of the Cinder project. This approach ensures backward
compatibility and makes it possible to restore older backups that were
created before the change.

Previously we would expect duplicates rows from MySQL and then filter
them with _unique_floatingip_iterator. This means that we were
converting rows to ORM-mapped objects unnecessarily. This conversion is
very CPU intensive.

Instead, we can remove the duplicates as a part of the query which means
that only unique rows are returned and the number of conversions from
rows to ORM-mapped objects is reduced significantly. It also means that
the _unique_floatingip_iterator function is no longer needed.

Since OpenStack Train release the 'cpu_models' config option
has superseded the 'cpu_model' config option in the nova.conf.
This patch adds support for the new 'cpu_models' allowing a user
to provide a comma separated list of supported, named CPU models.

This patch also includes a unit test for the cpu_mode='custom'.

- The idea is to enable operator to reserve a non reservable node and
  perform tests
- Only operator/admin should be able to reserve such nodes
- Polling monitor should not automatically make the node reservable
  if the 'disabled' flag is True

Set disabled field True for a host
`openstack reservation host set <host_id/name> --extra disabled=True`

Set disabled field False for a host
`openstack reservation host set <host_id/name> --extra disabled=False`

WIP: Setting disabled field works as desired (only admin can set/unset)
Creating lease on a disabled=True node doesn't work as desired
  (any project and user can reserve such node)
Expected behaviour: Only admins/admin project should be able
  to create lease on such nodes

Looks like using context policy.enforce does not work if an explicit
  policy is not defined.

This patch deals with overlooked situation in patch
d23f72ee501a5bdcc89806eb0ebbba929a36e64d, in which
`irmc_ipmi_succeed` flag is added to deal with iRMC
firmware's IPMI incompatibility introduced at iRMC
firmware version S6 2.00 and later.
That flag is set and updated by `irmc` power_interface
code and rest of iRMC driver code use that flag.

When `ipmitool` is set as power_interface, that flag
is not set nor updated and rest of iRMC driver code
fail to handle IPMI incompatibility correctly.

This patch adds logic to check power_interface to
make iRMC driver properly deal with iRMC firmware's IPMI
incompatibility even when `ipmitool` power_interface
is used.

Dell PowerMax SnapVx unlink fails as the linked device
is not yet fully defined.
This patch fixed the issue by checking the new configuration
'snapvx_unlink_symforce' and the linked device 'defined' status
to determine the value of 'symforce' in the payload of
SnapVx unlink restcall.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode ================================================ Add a field to accept the default verify_ca path ================================================ https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/2040236 This spec adds an option for setting [driver]verify_ca for each driver. This value would then be used by Ironic for certificate validation instead of the default system CA bundle for that driver. Each driver may use a different CA certificate for this purpose if desired. Problem description =================== Currently, Ironic utilizes a system-wide CA certificate bundle to validate HTTPS connections. However, there are scenarios where this default behavior may not align with the specific requirements or policies of an organization. Particularly, when a user specifies that certificate validation is required, administrators may prefer not to rely on the system's default certificate path for authentication with BMCs. Instead, they might need to utilize custom CA certificates, which are tailored to their organizational security policies or specific use cases. At present, if the operator desires to configure a custom CA certificate for communications between Ironic and the BMCs of managed bare-metal servers, they have the ability to configure the <driver>_verify_ca option on the node or nodes in question. This option can be configured to be either true, false, or set to a specific certificate path. When '<driver>_verify-ca' is set to true, Ironic defaults to using the system's CA bundle for certificate validation. Furthermore, in cases where the operator desires to specify a CA certificate outside system CA bundle, this approach has a serious shortcoming: it requires the operator to know the exact location of the pre-existing CA certificate in the filesystem. While this configuration option is set on per-node level through Ironic APIs, there is no way for the operator to either upload the CA certificate through those APIs or to determine the filesystem path of such certificate. This is not a desirable situation. This option is also unsuitable for the use cases where the operator is only able to interact with Ironic through writing configuration file and making API calls (which is the case in metal3). To overcome this limitation, we propose a new configuration option scoped on a driver level (as opposed to the node level): [driver]verify_ca. This way the required CA certificates can be deployed to known locations at the deploy time and Ironic configuration for each driver can be written referencing those paths. Proposed change =============== 1. Adding a new option default_verify_ca_path for each driver * Adding a verify_ca option to each driver's conf to accept the specified value. Making this option configurable on a per-driver level is consistent with existing configuration options (e.g. kernel_append_params). It is also very clear what purpose this specific CA certificate serves. 2. Retrieving the path before node verification * Before performing the node verification, retrieve the certificate path, and pass it to verify_ca for validation. This implementation vary based on different vendors. Alternatives ------------ * Administrators may need to log in to the system where ironic is located and manually add the desired certificate. Note: this requires modifications of the trusted CA certificate collection on the machine running Ironic, which may or may not be desired; there may be use cases where an operator wishes to trust a certain CA for connections to BMC but not other encrypted communications involving the server running Ironic. * Instead of [driver]verify_ca, a global configuration option similar to [conductor]verify_ca could be considered, however this could lead to confusion about the impact of setting it (does it apply to all conductor connections? BMC connections? else?) and would be inconsistent with other, similar options (e.g. kernel_append_params). * Using the existing <driver>_verify_ca setting is another alternative, however it requires prior existence of the desired CA certificate in the filesystem where Ironic is running as well as operator’s knowledge of the exact path, which should not be relied upon and as such is not desired. Data model impact ----------------- None State Machine Impact -------------------- None REST API impact --------------- None Client (CLI) impact ------------------- None RPC API impact -------------- None Driver API impact ----------------- None Nova driver impact ------------------ None Ramdisk impact -------------- None Security impact --------------- The introduction of the default_verify_ca_path configuration option in Ironic's driver could have several security implications: 1. Handling of Sensitive Data: * This change involves the path to CA certificates, which are critical for secure communications. While the option itself doesn't handle sensitive data like tokens or keys, it directs Ironic to the location of sensitive cryptographic material. Proper management and permissions of this path are essential to prevent unauthorized access. 2. Accessibility of Managed Hardware: * By allowing a custom CA path, this change could affect the security of the hardware managed by Ironic. If an incorrect or untrusted CA path is specified, it could potentially compromise the integrity of the SSL/TLS connections with the BMCs, impacting the secure management of the hardware. Other end user impact --------------------- None Scalability impact ------------------ None Performance Impact ------------------ None Other deployer impact --------------------- * At deploy time, one or more custom CA certificates may be installed on the machine running Ironic under a known path. * Ironic configuration created at the deploy time will assign the custom CA certificate to the driver(s) that are expected to be using it. * Each driver can use a different CA certificate, or the same CA certificate may be used by multiple drivers if desired. * The default None value for default_verify_ca_path ensures backward compatibility, using the system's default CA bundle unless overridden. This approach maintains operational stability for existing deployments while offering flexibility for custom configurations. * Ironic will be enhanced to dynamically retrieve the value of default_verify_ca_path for each hardware driver and pass it to the verify_ca function. This mechanism ensures that SSL/TLS communications with BMCs across different hardware types can leverage the specified custom CA certificates. * The feature requires explicit enablement by deployers. This change will not automatically activate. Developer impact ---------------- * Developers will need to ensure that their drivers correctly interpret and utilize the specified CA path.

Due to the unordered nature of sets, it is possible for signal
handlers like _gracefull_shutdown() to run first and clear the
_signal_handlers before other registered handlers have run.

This patch converts _signal_handlers from a set to a list and
then runs the handlers LIFO similar to how atexit functions are
run. Given that the handlers added in service.py are added after
clearing the signal_handlers, they are guaranteed to be the first
in the list and the last run.

Redis introduced ACL feature in 4.0.0, and this feature is supported by
redis-py since 3.4.0[1]. When ACL is enabled, authentication requires
username in addition to password.

This also fixes how password is parsed from uri string. The parameter
description has saied that password should be passed in the following
format
 redis://[:<password>]<host>...
but the actual format current code expects is
 redis://[<password>]<host>...
which is not compliant with standard URL format.

SQLite database can become more sparse as we remove rows. That pattern
that swift uses, which is to always add new rows and eventually clean up
old ones means we're quite susceptible. When we go and shard we
basically do a vaccum. BUT root containers are also susceptible because
the shard_range table is constantly added to for stat accounting
purposes.

Looking at one of our larger prod root containers the db size went from
570M to 13M once vacuumed manually.

This patch isn't quite ready. As there are 2 vacuum options.

  VACUUM - This rewrites the file then copies over the old version.
  VACCUM INTO - This writes a new file to a named location.

The possible advantage of the second is it might not need to take a full
write lock on the original file. We then can send the vacuumed copy,
which we can then delete. This might be less intruisive, but we don't
get the benefit of the local DB getting vacuumed, only the new remote
DB. And the copy could be slightly out of date. But usync will solve
this on the next replication cycle.

The advantages of vacuuming the DB before we send it via rsync when we
replicate which does 3 things:

  1. rewrites the file, defragmenting it and reducing the size.
  2. Making it smaller means less data over the network.
  3. Means during a swift cluster lifecycle, account and container DBs
     at least vacuum as dbs rebalance around the cluster.

It is this often enough?

This patch needs tests and a direction. It kind of supports both Vacuum
and vacuum into (maybe we don't need both of these).
Pushing it to aid discussion and in hopes to aid discussion.

An additional feature might be to figure out a way of determining how
""sparse"" the file is only vacuum when needed.

In Packstack, we use r10k to clone the Puppet Openstack modules
and all the dependencies.

Until now, we were managing the Puppetfile without automation
because we were tracking master branches.
Now for the dependencies, we want to pull the same versions as
the puppet-openstack-integration project ones for the common
modules.
For the dep modules required only by Packstack, we want to pull
the latest version.
For the Puppet Openstack modules we want to pull master branches.

This implementation is written in the generate_packstack_puppetfile
script, which generates the Puppetfile accordingly.

interface with the dummy type if it is called dummy*, otherwise it is
created as ethernet.

The default dev configuration was using eth1 for the bridge port, which
was causing issues on Rocky Linux 9, for example when following the
automated setup [1]. Switch to dummy1 to ensure a dummy port is created.

For example, when a new share is created, the request is immediately acknowledged with a response containing the metadata of the share. Users can then query the resource and check the ``status`` attribute of the share. Usually an ``...ing`` status indicates that actions are performed asynchronously. For example, a new share's ``status`` attribute is set to ``creating`` by the service. If these asynchronous operations fail, the resource's status will be set to ``error``. More information about the error can be obtained with the help of the CLI client. Scenario ~~~~~~~~ In this example, the user wants to create a share to host software libraries on several virtual machines. The example deliberately introduces two share creation failures to illustrate how to use the command line to retrieve user support messages. #. In order to create a share, you need to specify the share type that meets your requirements.

For example, when a new share is created, the request is immediately acknowledged with a response containing the metadata of the share. Users can then query the resource and check the ``status`` attribute of the share. Usually an ``...ing`` status indicates that actions are performed asynchronously. For example, a new share's ``status`` attribute is set to ``creating`` by the service. If these asynchronous operations fail, the resource's status will be set to ``error``. More information about the error can be obtained with the help of the CLI client. Scenario ~~~~~~~~ In this example, the user wants to create a share to host software libraries on several virtual machines. The example deliberately introduces two share creation failures to illustrate how to use the command line to retrieve user support messages. #. In order to create a share, you need to specify the share type that meets your requirements.

The correct usage when using keyword and varargs is

def func(arg1, *args, arg2=None, **kwargs):

Otherwise you can end up in having multiple values passed
for the parameters in case the method is called with
keyword arguments.

Fixed two calls to _get_ports_query() that were not
passing the 'filters' argument correctly.

Start enforcing this as well.

When updating legacy images, currenly we use the user's
context and elevate priviledges. However, we do not
require admin priviledges for the cinder API calls.

This patch removes the special case where we elevate
priviledges as it wasn't doing anything rather avoiding
us to use right credentials and failing to fetch volume
in the right location because of wrong credentials.

The correct credentials are either the service ones
set in glance-api.conf file or the user context
credentials, using which the Image-Volume was created.

NOTE: When using cinder as glance backend and we want
to perform optimized volume upload to image, one thing
we should make sure is either using the context or the
cinder credentials set in glance-api.conf file, it should
match the following details on the cinder side (if we are
using internal context to create clone of image-volumes):

cinder_store_user_name = context.user_id/cinder_internal_tenant_user_id
cinder_store_project_name = context.project_id/cinder_internal_tenant_project_id

The cinder_internal_tenant_user_id and
cinder_internal_tenant_project_id are set in the
[DEFAULT] section of cinder.conf.

This issue was first discovered when testing the new
location APIs[1] where tempest creates a volume with
cinder's internal context and glance uses wrong (user context)
credentials to access it and failing with 404 not found.

Actions such as remove-instance and add-instance
cause leader-settings updates, which in turn result
in flag updates that are later checked in actions
and hooks. However, a hook is required to run after
an action to apply the leader-settings updates into
the flags, causing issues when actions are run
without a hook in-between.

This patch addresses that by changing the flag
checks to leader-settings checks, so it is
always using the most up-to-date information
and preventing the issue.

Currently ceilometermiddleware supports customizing only the limited
number of oslo.messaging options via proxy-server.conf. However this
does not allow configurations required by some setups. For example when
TLS is enabled in RabbitMQ, the ssl option in RabbitMQ driver but this
option is not configurable now.

This introduces a few new options so that ceilometermiddleware can load
additional config files to look up oslo.messaging options.

Middleware may want to inspect the attributes of backend responses,
for example to find interesting headers that backends have
returned. When there is a multiplicity of backend responses, the
headers from all of them cannot be added to the single proxy
response. Besides, it is not always appropriate for backend headers to
be added to the proxy response. This patch therefore adds a list of
backend response attributes to the request environ under the key
'swift.backend_responses'.

This patch refactors the proxy controllers to replace the multitude of
lists holding statuses, reasons, bodies, headers with a single list of
ResponseData that encapsulates the attributes of each backend
response. This single list to Controller.best_response(), where it is
added to the request environ.

Drive-by: Stop passing server_type to best_response because it is
already an attribute of Controller. Always include the request method
when logging an error if quorum is not met for a backend response
status.

The first is Swift, Enabled when ``[redfish]use_swift`` is set to ``true``, where Ironic uploads files to Swift and serves them as Temporary URLs from Swift. While highly scalable, this method does sufer from issues where some vendors BMCs reject URLs with **&** or **?** characters. There is no available workaround to leverage Swift in this state. When the ``[redfish]use_swift`` setting is set to ``false``, Ironic will house the files locally in the ``[deploy]http_root`` folder structure, and then generate a URL pointing the BMC to connect to the HTTP service configured via ``[deploy]http_url``.

This may be the most overridden default of Ironic, which means
we need to change the default value.

The default for ``[redfish]use_swift`` was historically ``true``,
however we've generally found that BMCs are particularlly sensitive
to extra characters in the URL as the characters may signify a
dynamically generated file, which would be problematic as virtual
media webservers also generally require range retrieval support.

This change makes the default ``false`` which should lead to one
less override for operators being necessary in practical operation.

You can find more information on this at :doc:`/admin/secure-rbac`. Operators may choose to override default, in-code, Role Based Access Control policies by utilizing override policies, which you can learn about at :doc:`/configuration/policy`.",".. WARNING:: This information is presently in flux as of the Wallaby release with the implementation of ``Secure RBAC`` where ``system`` and ``project`` scoped requests are able to be parsed and default access controls support a delineation of roles and responsibilities through the roles. Please see :doc:`/admin/secure-rbac`. Beginning with the Newton (6.1.0) release, the Bare Metal service allows operators significant control over API access: * Access may be restricted to each method (GET, PUT, etc) for each REST resource. Defaults are provided with the release and defined in code. * Access may be divided between an ""administrative"" role with full access and ""observer"" role with read-only access. By default, these roles are assigned the names ``baremetal_admin`` and ``baremetal_observer``, respectively. * By default, passwords and instance secrets are hidden in ``driver_info`` and ``instance_info``, respectively. In case of debugging or diagnosing, the behavior can be overridden by changing the policy file. To allow password in ``driver_info`` unmasked for users with administrative privileges, apply following changes to policy configuration file:: ""show_password"": ""rule:is_admin"" And restart the Bare Metal API service to take effect. Please check :doc:`/configuration/policy` for more details. Prior to the Newton (6.1.0) release, the Bare Metal service only supported two policy options: * API access may be secured by a simple policy rule: users with administrative privileges may access all API resources, whereas users without administrative privileges may only access public API resources. * Passwords contained in the ``driver_info`` field may be hidden from all API responses with the ``show_password`` policy setting. This defaults to always hide passwords, regardless of the user's role. You can override it with policy configuration as described above. ",7,36

This change adds the publish-to-pypi job template
for the whitebox-tempest-plugin.
This change also correct the syntax error in the
README.rst preventign the twine check command form passing.

this will enable releases to be done via commits to the release
repo via pypi https://pypi.org/project/whitebox-tempest-plugin/

a side effect of this process is the creation of git tags
and release tarballs for each tagged release.

So please take a few minutes to look over the logs from the failing test job to see if you can identify the issue. * If you're not sure how to do this, ask in the ``#openstack-cinder`` channel (or during open discussion at the weekly cinder meeting), and someone will walk you through the basic process. * You can tell Zuul to do a recheck, but first: * Make sure you look at the job's build history, because if the job is failing consistently, it's probably due to some particular issue that must be fixed before the job will start passing again. So a recheck in this situation will just waste resources. Check the mailing list or ask in IRC or look at the comments on your patch (sometimes a reviewer will leave a note saying not to recheck until some other patch has merged). * When you think a recheck is appropriate, make sure you follow the OpenStack community guidelines for `How to Handle Test Failures <https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/testing.html#how-to-handle-test-failures>`_.",,24,0

Fixes usage of redfish detach virtual media feature to be conform to

Before the detach virtual media API call using redfish driver was not
working as intended and caused the operation to fail.

The method implementation was allowing only a single device_type
while it should be multiple devices to match the conductor manager
implementation.
